I feel like this should be searchable and isn't today.  So I am making a post to share that content.

There's a few things people should know to going fast.  All the shortcuts, and accessing your stuff.

# List Management

## Right-click

Be bold and use your middle finger, to right-click on everything.  This gives your access to the following actions;
filter out

- show matching
- show before
- show after
- build a report

## Use the monacle to search columns 

This will load a textbox below each column, they work with text like so;

- `text` defaults to starts with
- `=text` is the exact match (case insensitive)
- `*text` is the text contains

## Jump around with breadcrumbs

You can change your filter fast by smashing the different parts of the breadcrumbs.

- smash the chevron to remove the next specific filter
- smash the part of the filter to remove all the parts right of it

## Editing data in a list

You don't have to go into each record to change the data.

- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + smash and then double smash a cell to edit all selected rows for that column
- <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> / <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, then double smash a selected cell to edit all selected rows

## Control the data you see with the cog

- smash the cog to decide what columns you will see
- experiment with this as you can always reset

# Accessing your stuff fast

- Drag a condition onto the left hand menu to add it to your favorites
- <i class="fas fa-bars"></i>Ham sandwich menu has a create favorite option too that does the same from **list** and **record**
- Stars in the left hand menu appear if you hover, that will also add them to your favorites
- On the left hand menu in the star menu at the bottom is a pencil to edit all your favorites and their order
