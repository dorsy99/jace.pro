[MID Server support for source control]

    Use an existing MID Server to connect to a source control repository. Link your application to or import it from Source Control via an existing MID Server. Linking or importing through this option enables you to use a corporate GIT repository behind a firewall, and store http or ssh credentials for your GIT repository on your MID Server instead of the cloud.
