I work on web technogies every day with ambition to learn more about what makes the web work. I love working on new/new to me libraries and all things Javascript.
A few other things that is good to know;

* I love me some sci-fi and lit-rpg audiobooks (my favorite characters are used on the [Code Collab Tool](https://code.jace.pro) as random names when you load in.)
* My two young kids are amazing and  under the age of 5, so all things kids are big right now.
