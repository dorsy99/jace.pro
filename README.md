# Blog

> A blog about servicenow and other things

## Installing / Getting started

To get up and running you need [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jacebenson/blog
cd blog
path/to/hugo server --watch #should bind to localhost:1313
```

The code above clones this repo, goes into the new directory
and then expects you to run `hugo server --watch`, which 
generates and serves the site locally.

### Deploying / Publishing

It appears there are ways to allow Github to host hugo sites, 
however, I've gone with Netlify to do this as that makes this really simple.  If you don't want to test locally, you can do that as well.

1.  Logon to [netlify](https://netlify.com)
2.  Add a new site from Github
3.  It should have a Build Command of `hugo`
4.  It should have a Publish Directory of `public`
