This is the list of `sys_properties` on my PDI today.  
Sometimes I want to search these and yhey aren't all 
listed on the docs or developer sites.  Also It's a 
place where I can put gems if I find em.
<!--more-->

Also these two graphics come on the docs regarding property 
name conventions, so I'll include theme here to help identify 
what a property may be related to.

Set to 0 to stop all calculations and leave blank to enable calculation of all task SLAs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Stopping widgets that render slowly enables faster widgets to load, and increases the speed of dashboard loading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `glide.canvas.grid.widget_render_concurrent_max`                                  | Defines the maximum number of widgets that can render simultaneously on a dashboard. With smaller values, individual widgets load more quickly. With larger values, fewer Ajax requests to the server are needed. Set the value of this property to half of the number of widgets that are visible when your most-used dashboard loads. For example, if six widgets are visible on the dashboard set the value to 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `glide.discovery.bgp_router_disable`                                              | BGP router exploration disable. Controls whether Network Discovery exploration of routers running the BGP protocol is disabled. Normally such exploration IS disabled because of the huge size of BGP routing tables, and because generally such routers are only operating at the edge of large networks where further network discovery would be irrelevant. The only time this value should be set to "no" is in the unlikely case that your organization uses BGP routers as edge routers between relatively small networks (such as between buildings on a single campus).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `glide.discovery.discoverable.network.max.netmask.bits`                           | Maximum netmask size for discoverable networks (bits). The maximum number of bits in a regular netmask for networks that will be discovered by Network Discovery. By "regular netmask" we mean a netmask that can be expressed in binary as a string of ones followed by a string of zeroes (255.255.255.0 is regular, 255.255.255.64 is irregular). Regular networks are commonly expressed like this: 10.0.0.0/24, which means a network address of 10.0.0.0 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0. Larger bit numbers mean networks with smaller numbers of addresses in them. For example, the network 10.128.0.128/30 has four addresses in it: one network address (10.128.0.128), one broadcast address (10.128.0.131), and two usable addresses (10.128.0.129 and 10.128.0.130). Small networks like this are commonly configured in network gear to provide loopback addresses or networks used strictly by point-to-point connections. Since these sorts of networks generally don't need to be discovered by Network Discovery, it would be useful to filter them out. By setting this property to a value of 1 through 32, you can limit the sizes of regular networks that are discovered. Setting it to any other value will cause all networks to be discovered. Irregular networks are always discovered.

The default parsing of FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is to pick the first name separated by dots as the host name and the rest of the names as the domain name. For example, "machine1.testlab.service-now.com" has host name of "machine1" and domain name of "testlab.service-now.com". The property allows regex with two capturing groups with the first group representing the host name and the second group the domain name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This primarily affects host names discovered with NETBIOS, though some non-standard DNS systems may also return some or all of the name in upper case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A complete list of the interface type numbers may be found on the IANA web site, in the section "ifType definitions".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `glide.email.create_userid_from_email`                                            | When set to true, causes new users to be created with a UserID that matches their email address instead of firstname.lastname. This helps create unique UserIDs when two users with the same name send emails to an instance.

| `glide.email.forward_from_prefix`                                                 | When determining if an email is a forward, this field is used to match against something in the body.  This traditionally was "from:", but can include other words or words in other languages, each separated by commas.  For instance "from:,da:" would search for either "from:" or "da:".  Either would allow the email to be classified as a forward.  Leaving the field blank, means no search will occur, and the software will not require anything in the body for matching a forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `glide.import_set_row.dynamically_add_fields`                                     | Specifies whether an import set can add new columns to the staging table (true) or not (false). Instances that contain large numbers of import sets can sometimes become unresponsive when an import adds a column because the instance must alter every row in the staging table. In some cases, the database alter table action causes an outage. Setting this property to false prevents an import set from adding columns to the staging table and produces a log message. As a workaround, administrators can manually add a column to the staging table by creating a new dictionary entry and then reimporting the import set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If this property is blank, ServiceNow tries to map these binary attributes without the conversion and they are not guaranteed to be unique since they are not properly converted to string values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `glide.render.cache.aggressive`                                                   | Enable aggressive caching. If enabled, entries are removed from the render cache only when they expire from old age, rather than when their underlying data changes. Running in aggressive mode can significantly improve performance, but runs the risk of serving potentially 'stale' charts and graphs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Internally, this value is used as specified by Java. The system locale setting should be in the Java supported locales list.  NOTE: Do not change this value once a system has gone into production. If a user's locale must be changed, update the "Country code" field on the user record.  The value of this property determines the system's default currency into which all prices are automatically converted before other sums or conversions are performed.

For example, text/html will force html files to be downloaded to the client as attachments rather than viewed inline in the browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | text/html,image/svg,image/svg+xml                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
