> Abbreviations and acronyms are shortened forms of words or phrases.  An abbreviation is typically a shortened form of words used to represent the whole (such as Dr. or Prof.) while an acronym contains a set of initial letters from a phrase that usually form another word (such as radar or scuba).

Like me, you probably have seen many refer to ServiceNow as "Snow" or "SN".

Is there a right way to shorten ServiceNow?

As much as I want to say one way is right, and the other is wrong, by the results of the survey, really we should just use the full name.

What do you use when referring to ServiceNow, let me know in the comments or reply to the [survey](https://twitter.com/jacebenson/status/1254853140551069702) and why.
