So Knowledge20 is a new experience for everyone, attendees and organizers.  Everything has changed.

Last week I wrote, that I am **amazed** at the work ServiceNow did to make this event happen remotely when it was slated to be an in person event at no cost.

- [Getting the most out of Steven Bell's Content Contributions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp8n3_K1438)
	- Getting Started
		- Why write?
			- You're excited to share something, to transfer the knowledge.
			- Watch out for corporate policies - make sure you "can" write.  (I can't believe this is a thing!)
			- Search for others who have written on the topic.  Don't plagiarize them.  You'll find people asking questions that your content may solve.  Comeback to those and let them know you have a post here to help.  Credit or link to others with similar content.
			- Join the user's group and you can "blog" there (I [Jace] think you should own your content and self host but.. /shrug)
			- Review how others have written their articles.  Each author has their own methods.
	- What kinds of topics to write about
		- Pick a subject inside of ServiceNow
			- Process
			- Procedure
			- An application
			- Development & Scripting
			- Integration
			- Architecture
		- Write what you know
		- Write about what you've made
		- ( Write about what excites you )
	- How to organize articles
		- Pick the venue(place to write)
		- Always have a introduction
		- Put in a problem statement (this should be the hook)
		- What approaches did you try
		- What approaches work
		- What approach did you like the most
		- Conclusion (tie into the problem statement)
	- Finding time to write and publish
		- Off hours
		- (As you have an idea for a topic, write it down, or make an issue for yourself)
		- tackling a large topic, break it up into smaller chunks
		- dont be afraid to write, you should write.  have a reason to write, for yourself or for other.
	- Where do I go from here
		- be involved on community
		- speaking at user groups
	- Open Q + A
		- Lisa Latour is the person to reach out to if oyu have any questions about this.
		- No questions
