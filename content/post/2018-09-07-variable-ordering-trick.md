Today I learned a trick that would have saved me hours had I known about it years ago.

From time to time you find yourself working on a catalog item with many variables.  Sometimes those variables orders are to close together to allow for new things.  It would be great if you just press a button and have the order be fixed at 100s.  You could write something custom... Or you could just follow these steps;

1. Preview Item
1. Right-click header
1. Configure variables
1. Change the order of one variable
1. OK
1. Change the order back.

Now the variables are spaced in 100s
