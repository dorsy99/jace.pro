After hearing about how certifications are changing I read up on it
some. I found the site confusing, so I made this post to put the useful
things together.

# Certifications

As of 7/1/2018 you're need to take a class to
register for the exams [according to this
pdf](./certifications-faq.pdf).

I was looking for a list of the certifications SN offers. As of today
This is all I can find. Here's my sources;

`*` No Certification Documentation could be found, but it's listed as if
one exists on the [Certification Guide] - [locally incase SN updates/takes down original](./certifications-guide.pdf).

Learning Resources

-   [Saif Fundamentals] $0
-   [Servicenow Foundations eLearning] $0
-   [NowLearning] $$$

A [post] was made about **why** training is mandatory. 
I can't find my source but some folks have said

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Nowsupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NOWsupport</a> Why are certificates for all things changing to a &quot;you must take a class to test&quot; method on 7/1/2018 for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/servicenow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#servicenow</a> certs?</p>&mdash; Jace Benson üë®‚Äçüíª‚öôÔ∏è (@jacebenson) <a href="https://twitter.com/jacebenson/status/1012773334176731141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Cost of Certifications

With all this being said, I also did some quick math;

| When | People | Certs  | Class Cost | Total Class Cost | Exam Cost | Total Exam Cost | Maint Cost`*` | Total Maint Cost`*` |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ---------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 2018 |      1 |      3 |          0 |                0 |       150 |             450 |             0 |                   0 |
| 2018 |     75 |      3 |          0 |                0 |       150 |          33,750 |             0 |                   0 |
| 2019 |      1 |      9 |      2,000 |           18,000 |       150 |           1,350 |           100 |                 900 |
| 2019 |     75 |      9 |      2,000 |        1,350,000 |       150 |         101,250 |           100 |              67,500 |
| 2020 |      1 | 17`**` |      2,400 |           40,800 |       150 |           2,550 |           100 |               1,700 |
| 2020 |     75 | 17`**` |      2,400 |        3,060,000 |       150 |         191,250 |           100 |             127,500 |

`*` Every Three releases, you need to pay 100 USD for maintenance of your certificate.  
`**` There are 41 Certificates listed, but of the CSA, CIS, and CAD type certs that cost money I found 17.
