[Edit source control integration files outside of Studio]

    Edit application files linked to a source control integration using an editor other than Studio. To ensure that the application files remain usable, the instance validates and sanitizes application files edited by other editing applications. Application files that fail XML schema validation either abort the current source control operation or are skipped. The instance generates an upgrade log entry for each sanitization action taken.
