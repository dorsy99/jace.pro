Megaphone is some hidden application Servicenow made but didn't release.

This is not visible unless you change the module roles from `maint` to
`admin`.

This uses the table, `sys_broadcast_message` and that creates a message
as depicted in this
[thread](https://community.servicenow.com/message/1193491#1193491).
