Last year I was pretty bitter about the hackathon.  This year, I think the event will be better.  Andrew Barnes and Brad Tilton are running this event.  As I understand it these are the details;

First lets go over what you'll get out of this.  

- You will learn how to build whatever it is you're building.  So if you want to try out the new now-expierence, here's your time to shine.
- You will likely form a team and make better bonds with those on it.
- You might win one the five categories, if you do you'll get $500 USD, or $5,000 USD for your team.
- You may also be featured in some content sent out to people who want that kind of stuff.

Now let's go over the specifics.

| Questions | Answers |
| --------- | ------- |
| How big can the teams be? | 1-8 people.|
| When does it start? | May 1st.|
| When does it end? | May 3rd.|
| How many teams will be named winners? | 5 |
| What critera will things be judged by? | <ul><li>Utility</li><li>User Experience</li><li>Innovation</li><li>Technical Difficulty</li></ul> |

Last year [I wrote up a detailed blog about winning hackathons](https://jace.pro/post/2019-04-22-knowledge-hackathon-past/) and reviewed all the past hackathon's I could find (2013-2018).

May the odds be ever in your favor.
