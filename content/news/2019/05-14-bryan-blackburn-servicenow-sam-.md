<p>Historically, the most challenging aspect of any Software Asset Management program, regardless of the tool, is gathering of software entitlements in a meaningful and complete way. With SAM, the simplest way to accomplish this is through the Entitlement Import feature, which leverages a drag-and-drop interface to import a .xlsx file, and automatically manage six pre-import and six post-import data quality checks.
