<h1 class="">Now on Now: Enabling Intelligent Operations Using ITOM, AIOps, and the Now Platform</h1>
<p class="">Thursday, May 16<sup>th</sup>, 2019<br />8am – 9am PT | 11am – 12pm ET</p>
<p class="">Most enterprises know that their industry is being disrupted by digital trends, but few are prepared for it. IT Operations - which is at the heart of the transformation – is under the most pressure to modernize. With the drive to cloud-first initiatives, IT Ops often tries to build flexible digital experiences on top of outdated technology stacks, breaking traditional processes and increasing the likelihood of service degradation with complex business services. Additionally, building non-stop private and public clouds with multi-instance architecture, complete data isolation, and redundancy across network application and database layers adds a new set of challenges. <br /><br />Join us for this webinar and learn how ServiceNow leverages IT Operations Management to:</p>
<ul><li>Speed time-to-deployment by automating time-consuming operational tasks.</li><li>Accelerate problem identification and resolution with AIOps.</li><li>Make the shift from an infrastructure-centric to a business-centric IT organization.</li></ul>
