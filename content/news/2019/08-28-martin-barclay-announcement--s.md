<p>Today we’re announcing the activation of the ServiceNow Store – G2 App Reviews initiative for all Now® Certified apps and integrations published to the ServiceNow Store. This initiative is an investment by ServiceNow in the Technology Partner ecosystem to drive Store partner success. See <strong>Get Started Today </strong>to claim your profile page on <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/servicenow-store-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">G2.com</a> and start attracting more buyers for your app!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Goals</strong></span></p>
<p> The goal of this initiative is two-fold:</p>
<ul><li>Drive increased discovery, awareness, and consideration of ServiceNow Store apps among potential buyers at the right time in the buyer journey</li><li>Drive increased conversions from visitors to leads in the ServiceNow Store</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Strategy</strong></span></p>
<p>The strategy is simple – to amplify the voice of your customers to build trust among potential buyers (your customer’s peers) that your app delivers the best solution for their business needs.  Buyers also expect to see reviews in an app marketplace and more reviews signal an active and engaged buyer and user community.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Who is G2?</strong> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.g2.com/" rel="nofollow">G2</a> is the world’s largest B2B software &amp; services review platform featuring 95,000&#43; product listings and 850,000&#43; authentic reviews.  3 million monthly unique software buyers come to G2 to engage with long-form, rich, and unbiased reviews from the world’s largest B2B data cloud.</p>
<p>G2 is de-mystifying technology buying by providing real-time buyer insights and empowering B2B buyers to make informed decisions with verified user reviews. G2 has shifted the focus to real customers, active buyers, and the increasingly innovative marketplace of B2B technology buying. Through G2’s trusted moderation process, data and scale, G2 is disrupting the way B2B software buying happens.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>G2 &#43; ServiceNow Store Partnership</strong></span></p>
<p>We aim to bring our Store partners the latest in marketing benefits and this partnership with the leader in B2B software reviews is all about amplifying the voice of your customers to positively influence new buyer behavior.  Other major B2B software marketplace vendors who have recently partnered with G2 include CDW, Marketo LaunchPoint, and ADP.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p>This effort delivers three main benefits to Store partners:</p>
<ol><li><strong>G2 profile page - </strong>G2 has created a profile page on G2.com for every app in the Store as of 8/21/19. New profile pages will be added quarterly to bring in new apps. All Store apps can be found in the dedicated <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/servicenow-store-apps" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Store Apps Category</a>. Presence on G2.com will elevate the discoverability of your app and positively influence consideration at the right point in the buying cycle – when buyers are ready to buy and are researching alternatives.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Review syndication:</strong> Reviews left by customers on your app’s G2.com profile page are automatically syndicated to your ServiceNow Store app page. These reviews will provide ServiceNow customers with the trust and confidence they need to ultimately convert and act on your Store app listing to Contact, Try, or Buy. Please see <strong>Review Syndication Types</strong> for more information.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Review Campaigns: </strong>G2 will gladly run a review campaign on your behalf! All that is needed is a list of your customers (first names and email addresses) and G2 will send out the requests for reviews, with no additional work or cost required from your team.     </li></ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why Reviews Matter</strong></span></p>
<p>The B2B software buyer journey  is undergoing a consumerization shift, just as enterprise software itself is.  This means that buyers are increasingly doing more research online before they even reach out to a vendor. According to <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/smartbrief-content-marketing-institute-how-content-influences-purchasing-process-research.pdf" rel="nofollow">SmartBrief</a>, 81% of buyers generally conduct research before bringing in a vendor. This means it’s critical that your app get discovered and considered early in the buyer evaluation process.</p>
<p>The most important types of content that buyers are seeking as they do their research online are peer experiences and product ratings or reviews. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://community.servicenow.com/2499a999db2b37841cd8a345ca961930.iix" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p>Additional data points:</p>
<ul><li>Displaying reviews can increase conversion rates by 270% (Spiegel Research Center, 2017)</li><li>Having five reviews results in purchase likelihood increasing by a factor of almost four times (Spiegel Research Center, 2017)</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Reviews 101 </strong></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Review Syndication Types</span></h2>
<p>There are two ways reviews are syndicated, both of which are attributed with G2 branding so Store customers know the review source and can click through to the review on G2.com.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Store Reviews</strong> – reviews for Now Platform apps and integrations on the Store. In the case of integrations, the review content syndicated to Store Reviews is specifically about the integration with ServiceNow on the Store. Reviews created directly on the Store are displayed here as well.  <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Other Reviews</strong> – reviews on this tab are for the primary (standalone external to ServiceNow) product that has an integration with ServiceNow in the Store. <strong>Other Reviews are available exclusively to paid integration partners</strong> and enables prospects to see reviews about paid integration partners’ primary product as a standalone product outside the context of ServiceNow. This enables paid integration partners to “take their reviews with them” for their standalone product from G2 to the Store. </li></ul>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">G2 Review Types and Partner Program Points</span></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>There are two types of reviews on G2:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Validated Reviewer</strong> – professional identity is validated by G2 and review content must pass G2 moderation process<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Verified Current User</strong> – same as Validated Reviewer plus the reviewer must upload a screenshot showing them logged into the app. <strong>Technology Program Participants can earn Program Points for Verified Current User reviews</strong> provided that the Program Points Criteria in the <a href="https://partnerportal.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0010115" rel="nofollow">Partner Program Guide</a> are adhered to. See &#34;Applications Built on the Platform &amp; Available in AppStore&#34; and &#34;Validated App Review&#34; under Program Points Criteria in the Partner Program Guide for complete information.</li></ol>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Review Validation &amp; Moderation</span></h2>
<p>Reviewers log in with either LinkedIn or a business email, allowing G2 to verify their work history, role and industry.  We’re able to reduce bias by excluding reviews from employees of the product being reviewed, as well as employees of their competitors. G2’s review moderation process goes beyond other sites’ simple content moderation by validating the professional identity of the user.  All reviews are manually checked by G2&#39;s 50-person review moderation team after an algorithm filters out reviews that do not meet the minimum submission requirements. All reviews must pass the moderation process before they are published.</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring reviewers are validated professionals, we are enhancing reviews themselves. Currently, the average reviewer answers over 80% of the questions and composes over 125 words in a review. The structure of a G2 review is another differentiator to ensure high-quality content. After seven years of optimizing methods to collect B2B reviews, we learned that asking structured questions (compared to an open text box) yields the most valuable content. Every review on G2 asks the question “what do you like?” as well as “what do you dislike?”. This gives the buyer a more holistic view  and provides constructive feedback for every solution.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Review Generation</span></h2>
<p>While generating rich B2B reviews are difficult, G2 has spent the last seven years optimizing its outreach strategy, generating nearly 1,000 approved reviews daily. G2 gathers reviews in four broad buckets:</p>
<ul><li>Organic - G2 receives over 3 million visitors monthly and as a result, thousands of visitors leave reviews organically</li><li>G2 Review Campaigns -  using a nominal gift card, G2 has a team that develops targeted outreach to drive reviews</li><li>Vendor-Driven Efforts - vendors on G2 understand the value of B2B reviews and drive G2 reviews themselves through a variety of efforts</li><li>On-Site Review Booths -  G2 attends hundreds of vendor events across the world; often, G2 will have a review booth and use a philanthropic donation as the review incentive. G2 was present at Knowledge 2019 with a dedicated review booth on the show floor that generated over 300 reviews for ServiceNow Store apps.</li></ul>

<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Responding to Reviews</span></h2>
<p>Respond directly to a review written on G2 to thank the reviewer, address concerns, or remediate any poor experiences. Negative reviews can have a positive impact. As a vendor, you can respond and share your perspective by commenting on a review so anyone reading that review will also see your input.

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>FAQ</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Is my app on G2.com?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if your app was on the Store as at 8/21/19. G2 has created a profile page for every app on the ServiceNow Store as at 8/21/19 . New profiles for new apps on the Store are added once per quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Does this cost me anything?</strong></p>
<p>No. ServiceNow is investing in this initiative as a free marketing benefit for our Store partners.</p>
<p><strong>I want to update information and generate reviews on my G2 profile, how do I do that?</strong></p>
<p>Head to your G2 profile on g2.com and <em>claim</em> your product page. From there, a G2 team member will reach out and guide you through the next steps to update your profile and generate reviews. There are many ways to optimize your presence on G2, for example responding to reviews, adding product information to your profile, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Do G2 reviews qualify for </strong><strong>Partner Program Points</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, however only Verified Current User reviews on G2 that meet the Program Points Criteria in the <a href="https://partnerportal.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0010115" rel="nofollow">Partner Program Guide</a> qualify for Partner Points.</p>
<p><strong>Are G2 reviews replacing the ability for my customers to leave reviews directly on the Store?</strong></p>
<p>No. G2 reviews are augmenting/additive to native Store reviews and are not replacing them. Customers can continue to leave reviews directly on the Store.</p>
<p><strong>How do G2 reviews affect the Store home page Sort by Rating ranking?</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of Store home page sort by rating ranking, reviews – both Validated Reviewer and Verified Current User types - created on G2 for native Now Platform apps and for integrations on the Store count the same as reviews created directly on the Store.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do to get my G2 reviews on my ServiceNow Store listing?</strong></p>
<p>For native Now Platform apps, nothing! Reviews on your G2 product profile will automatically be syndicated to your ServiceNow Store listing. For integrations, you’ll need to get your unique integration form URL from G2 by emailing <a href="mailto:partnerships&#64;g2.com" rel="nofollow">partnerships&#64;g2.com</a> and then ask your customers to complete and submit the form. These reviews will then be syndicated to the Store reviews tab.  Paid integration standalone product reviews are automatically syndicated to the Other reviews tab on the Store.</p>
<p><strong>My app is an integration between a 3rd party product and ServiceNow. What do I need to do to get my G2 reviews on my ServiceNow Store listing?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing because your integration is treated like a primary product on G2 and will be automatically syndicated as a Store review.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do if I have concerns about the validity of a review left on G2?</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the validity (i.e. you believe/know the review was written by someone who is not a real customer of your app) of a review on G2.com, click on the &#34;Report a Concern&#34; button underneath the review and the G2 team will respond to you in a timely manner.  In all cases, partners are requested to always use the G2 Report a Concern button to open review validation cases directly with G2.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do if I have concerns about the content of a review?</strong></p>
<p>You can respond to and share your perspective by commenting on a review so anyone reading that review will also see your input. </p>
