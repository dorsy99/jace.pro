<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Unified Cloud Discovery</strong></span></p>
<p>Visibility to cloud, containers and hyper-converged technology stack is imperative to the successful CMDB data strategy, which can deliver multiple outcomes. ITOM Visibility offers content to discover AWS/Azure/GCP and IBM cloud IaaS/PaaS/FaaS services in near real-time. With NY release, customers can leverage the newly designed wizard, which allows discovery administrators to add new cloud service account, validate credentials, select data centers and create discovery schedules from an intuitive outcome-driven UX. Data visualization of discovered cloud services also helps discovery administrators to validate the cloud discovery results in real-time.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>AWS Cloud discovery - Enhancements</strong></span><br /> <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery via IAM Role</span>: MID server deployed on AWS EC2 with IAM role can bypass the credential requirements for AWS cloud discovery. Discovery during runtime will use the temporary security credentials retrieved via the AWS Instance metadata service. Customers will be able to pin their IAM Role on a selected MID with a simple profile setting.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWS Assume Role Enhancements</span>: ServiceNow discovery fully supports AWS organizations via Assume Role. MID Server can call an AWS API and use the permanent credentials of an AWS master account (organization) to assume the role of one or more member accounts. By assuming the role, the MID Server receives temporary credentials for the member accounts generated by AWS for that role. Prior to NY release, customers should use the default role OrganizationAccountAccessRole for this feature to work. With NY release, customers can configure any custom role profiles for this use case.</p>

<p>Probe to pattern migration is only supported for the New York release and later. Check out the official <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri&#61;%2Fkb_view.do%3Fsysparm_article%3DKB0694477" rel="nofollow">KB0694477</a> article for more details on this topic.</p>

<p><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>File signature-based discovery – General Availability</strong></span></p>
<p>File-based discovery capability was introduced as a limited access feature with Madrid release [ <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;d17f9452db3f6304feb1a851ca9619dd" rel="nofollow">Release Blog</a> ]. We are happy to announce the general availability of this feature to all existing ITOM Discovery customers. A special thank you note to design partners who helped us to validate this feature and challenge discovery product team to deliver extended capabilities. With NY release, customers can activate this feature with discovery guided setup and configure the scan configurations from a user-friendly UI.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Service Mapping Enhancements</strong></span></p>
<p>Service Mapping solution adds application context to the underlying infrastructure. Service mapping feature also observed interesting updates with NY release. NY customers will be able to define discovery schedules for top-down mapping solution by service attributes or service group attributes. Import/Export of service definitions also helps customers to move their configurations between test/dev/production instances. ServiceNow team worked with Dynatrace product management to enhance the 3rd party map ingestion into CMDB. The new integration allows Dynatrace maps to assign applications to hosts and preserves connections between applications.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Discovery content updates</strong></span></p>
<p>Last year, we decoupled the pattern content from the family releases. This allows our customers to adopt these new patterns out of band from ServiceNow store release. Check out the ever-growing content from the store application updates and don’t miss to upgrade your <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/search?q&#61;Discovery%20and%20Service%20Mapping%20patterns&amp;category&#61;Discovery&amp;offeredBy&#61;servicenow&amp;orderby&#61;relevance" rel="nofollow">store application</a> on a monthly basis to get new content updates.</p>
