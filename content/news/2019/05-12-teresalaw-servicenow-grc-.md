<p>The last 3 days at #Knowledge19 have been exhilarating!  I’ve been lucky enough to spend it with some amazing #ServiceNow #GRC customers and partners.  I’m always blown away by what they’ve done with the product and what new directions they’ve taken it in to make it work for them.  And I can’t thank all the speakers enough for sharing their stories.  You’ll be seeing some of those stories appearing here over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>There were a few common themes I heard that I’d like to share:</p>
<ol><li>Organizations are betting big on ServiceNow GRC. With the power of the platform to support it and continuous innovation to drive it, I believe the path to being #1 in the market is clear.  So many customers I spoke to are making big bets on it with the goal of eventually creating a truly enterprise GRC solution (that spans departments and functional groups). Avanade is an excellent example of this. Others I talked to are just starting the journey or investigating the possibilities. And those ServiceNow customers that are on a competitive GRC product are looking for ways to convince non-supporters in their organizations to make the leap. </li></ol>
<ol start="2"><li>Managing third-party risk is on everyone’s mind. An overwhelming number of people that stopped by the booth wanted to talk about Vendor Risk Management.  The Vendor Risk sessions were packed, and the questions indicated people were clearly looking at it as a way to solve their existing vendor assessment woes.  Whether it is the new regulations or the concern over the number of breaches that involved 3<sup>rd</sup>-parties, people are taking the need to assess the risk posed by third parties seriously. </li></ol>
<ol start="3"><li>“Out-of-the-box” with thoughtful enhancements. So many customers I spoke to who have implemented GRC and Vendor Risk did so with a low-code/no-code policy – and they are advocating it to others who are on their journey.  AltaGas was the most outstanding, implementing Risk Management completely out of the box in just 45 days. That said, many are also adapting it to make it their own in fascinating ways – that is a testament to the flexibility of the platform and the GRC/Vendor Risk solution.  For example, one customer (a large telco) is tiering and assessing vendors on the engagement level, not the vendor level. Both they and City and County of Denver have developed unique ways to build risk assessments based on the answers to the tiering assessments, making them specific to the engagement or vendor service/offering. Another customer (a large financial institution) has developed an access review app to address compliance requirements. Allianz SE and others have added UI enhancements to speed response and lifecycle management of risks.   </li></ol>
<ol start="4"><li>Dashboards are becoming king. “Create a shared awareness at all levels in the organization” or “escalate risks to the point where awareness and ownership should reside”. These sentiments expressed by Hershey and Vodafone respectively were indicative of how many customers are using the GRC solution.  Primarily through dashboards, most built using Performance Analytics, customers want, or are being ask, to create sustainable processes that improve communication and visibility at all levels in the organization.  Forcing those at the highest levels to acknowledge, focus and respond to critical risks. </li></ol>
<ol start="5"><li>Standardizing and automating processes drive big efficiency gains. Every customer had a story that talked about the ability to do things faster or more with less. Novartis created a single global process to gauge vendor risk allowing them to begin scaling their vendor risk program to numbers you wouldn’t believe. A customer that is a large educational institution tackled a perfect storm of challenges to emerge with, among other things, faster analysis of data and reporting activities, with automated and standardized workflows for issues and control tests. Bucking common convention, GRC was the first ServiceNow product they implemented.  A story I heard more than once at Knowledge 19.</li></ol>
<p>Our GRC partners played key roles in most of these stories.  In breakouts and in the partner theater Accenture, Iceberg, Sargon, KPMG, Verterim, Deloitte, INRY, and Ernst &amp; Young (EY) all shared their years of experience implementing GRC solutions and highlighted the value ServiceNow GRC offers.  GRC was also present in panel discussions, playing a significant role in allowing healthcare organizations to comply with regulations, standards, and frameworks such as #HIPAA and #Hitrust. And finally, our own GRC journey with Now on Now drew big crowds as usual.</p>
<p>GRC was truly everywhere at Knowledge 19 and I felt the excitement of the “art of the possible” at every turn. I look forward to another exciting year and can’t wait to hear the stories customers will tell about ServiceNow GRC next year.  I wish I could include pictures of all the amazing speakers and the packed rooms, but here are just a few. #Know19 #IRM</p>
