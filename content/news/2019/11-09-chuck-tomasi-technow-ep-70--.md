<p><strong>Will these slides be available after the webinar?</strong> -- Mark Gefrom<br /> Yes. I will have them available from episode 70 on the episode list at http://bit.ly/servicenow-technow -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>does that debugging works on a portal?</strong> -- Steven Chaparro<br /> Haven&#39;t checked. Good question. I&#39;ll have to get back to you. F12 will open up a browser-level &#34;debugging&#34; tool, but does not work/look the same as UI16 debugging. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="3218b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961942"> </div>
<p><strong>Can you have a different background image, and/or a different banner logo based on the language in the portals?</strong> -- Steven Chaparro<br /> Out of the box, the portals don&#39;t do that, but you could easily make one. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="3618b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf96193f"> </div>

<p><strong>Hi team, thank you for the session. My query goes as follows, Does translating the portal must be done using gs.getMessage on every widget and component manually, or, any other alternatives to apply on to the portal directly ? Is there any such configuration specifically for Portals?</strong> -- Rajalakshmi Rathinasabhapathy<br /> We were planning to show Service Portal translation, but didn&#39;t have the chance. If you enclose your HTML text to be translated in ${msg_key} format, it will do the translation from sys_ui_message automatically. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Im using a code in a portal to change the language for a guest user, but I dont want to make that language change permanent because I expect a lot of user visiting the portal with multiple language selection at the same time.</strong> -- Steven Chaparro<br /> We were planning to show Service Portal translation, but didn&#39;t have the chance. If you enclose your HTML text to be translated in ${msg_key} format, it will do the translation from sys_ui_message automatically. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6218b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961913"> </div>
<p><strong>Maybe an addition, you can use the sys_ui_message not only for translation, though also to overwrite out-of-the-box english messages instead of editing widgets/ui pages/etc</strong> -- Mark Roethof<br /> Great point Mark, and yes this is something i&#39;ve done in lieu of cracking open OOB widgets. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6618b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961910"> </div>
<p><strong>Chuck, I would like to know where you got the full-sized dalek behind you :)</strong> -- Lisa Jones<br /> Lisa, it came with the house. I bought the house from a friend and he built out this studio. The Dalek was part of the package. :) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="7218b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961944"> </div>

<div id="7618b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961941"> </div>
<p><strong>Did you say the custom translations are captured in Update Sets?</strong> -- Terry Oldham<br /> Yes. Entries in sys_translated, sys_documentation, sys_ui_message, and sys_choice are captured in update sets, source control, and app repo files. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="7a18b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf96193e"> </div>

<p><strong>languages that are not available through language packs right now, for example Vietnamese, is there a way to check on roadmap if / when the language may become available?</strong> -- Heidi Choy<br /> I&#39;m not aware of any published roadmap, but if you have an idea, post it to the Idea portal on the community at community.servicenow.com -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b218b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961915"> </div>

<p><strong>How to show the kb articles just for the language selected in different parts of the portal i.e. Knowledge page, knowledge search, knowledge widgets</strong> -- Steven Chaparro<br /> We&#39;ll have to check and get back to you. I&#39;m not a Knowledge expert. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="ba18b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961940"> </div>
<p><strong>Add the labels, messages, or choices to the appropriate table in English with an ending of the language code for newly added customizations that are missing translations. (Translate and Learn) Yes | No</strong> -- Steven Chaparro<br /> Yes, the translate and learn option is a good one, but it only learns what you&#39;ve visited. If your testers didn&#39;t test it, it won&#39;t be &#34;learned&#34;. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="be18b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961917"> </div>
<p><strong>how can I tell if catalog items have been translated?</strong> -- Kathy Pitts<br /> Hey Kathy, you would need to test the catalog items to validate whether/not they are being translated. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Hi, if you are looking to translate an instance which is not as a language pack.. (such as Romainian) is there an easy way to export tables that you then need to translate..</strong> -- Martin Sanders<br /> Yes. Kreg will cover the basics on that in a little while. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Right now I have created a business rule for the User Preference table that runs only when the user is Guest, and in advance, I am running a script when the condition is !gs.isLoggedIn() and in the script I added the gs.addErrorMessage(gs.getMessage(&#39;A user preference cannot be saved for unauthenticateduser&#39;) and then I have a current.setAbortAction(true). I was wondering if there is another way to accomplish what I am trying to do? So far I think it is working.</strong> -- Steven Chaparro<br /> I&#39;m not sure what the requirement is. It appears you are using gs.getMessage() properly. What is the intended outcome/result? -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="fa18b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf961942"> </div>
<p><strong>What&#39;s the current UNICODE version supported?</strong> -- Douglas Hanna<br /> In general, we use native Java APIs for all text handling. We run Java 8, so it would be the version supported by Java 8: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html &#34;The Java SE 8 Platform uses character information from version 6.2 of the Unicode Standard...&#34; -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="fe18b7fbdbd10c5083bd7646bf96193f"> </div>
<p><strong>in the system properties there is a system localization property that you can enable for those fields without a translation.</strong> -- Steven Chaparro<br /> Localization depends on the field type. If you have a choice, translated_text or translated_html field, it will be translated. String, HTML and most other fields are not. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
