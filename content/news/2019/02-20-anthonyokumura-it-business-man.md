<h3>Major new value for ITBM in Madrid release</h3>
<p>For the Madrid release our IT Business Management product teams have focused on four themes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Unified ITBM Experience - </strong>Build out more end to end use cases spanning multiple personas</li><li><strong>User Experience - </strong>Build out more persona specific user experiences</li><li><strong>Scaled Agile - </strong>Enhance our abilities to support organizations embracing agile</li><li><strong>Core PPM Capabilities - </strong>Strengthen core resource management and project financials</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>These themes represent another innovative leap forward for IT Business Management, in many cases building on the advances already made in the London release. Here are some examples:<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Portfolio Dashboards </strong>are easy to understand visualizations that portfolio or program manager can leverage to keep their portfolios on track. This will help organizations reduce time and cost of integrating and collecting data and speed decision making.</p>

<p><strong>Portfolio Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) </strong>will enable you to establish strategic themes for a given portfolio and guide solutions allowing alignment with business priorities and providing a constant flow of feedback from the portfolio back to the enterprise stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Application Portfolio Roadmap </strong>allows you to visualize projects and demand for your application investments, so you can confidently plan. The application roadmap shows the timeline for all related strategic and operational demands and projects, which is key to make strategic planning decisions such as enhancements, decommissions, or moves to cloud.</p>
