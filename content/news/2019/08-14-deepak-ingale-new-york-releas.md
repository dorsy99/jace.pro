<p>New release of &#34;New York&#34; seems to have good features for native developer who are using JavaScript Editor within the platform.</p>
<p>One of the cool thing that has been introduced is &#34;context menu&#34; for getting script include definition, finding documentation for Glide APIs</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-application-development/page/script/general-scripting/concept/c_SyntaxEditor.html#context-menu-syntax-editor" rel="nofollow">https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-application-development/page/script/general-scripting/concept/c_SyntaxEditor.html#context-menu-syntax-editor</a></p>
<p>Below is the screen capture of how code looks inside new editor</p>

<p>Highlighted in dark black color in italic fonts are APIs which contains a link to definition of the library. if it is script include like <em><strong>JSUtil , </strong></em>we just need to <strong>CNTR &#43; click</strong> and system opens the JSUtil script include in new tab.</p>
<p>We can also notice table name inside GlideRecord class is highlighted in dark blue color ( <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>incident</strong></em></span> )<strong> . CNTR &#43; click</strong> on the link opens the table definition in new tab. </p>
<p>Both these features are quite helpful for developers to get  properties or methods of the script include and to see the column names of the table </p>
<p>Happy coding and please do share if you have come across any such new features in the platform </p>
