<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Modern enterprises are increasingly global, reliant on technology and third parties, and subject to a continuously changing regulatory environment.  The trend toward digital transformation is creating even greater urgency to measure and report on new types of risks across the organization. Gartner recognized the need for a common, collaborative platform to support the interconnected risk relationships generated by these evolving enterprises with their publishing of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Integrated Risk Management (IRM).</span></p>
