<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We have completed over 30 stories of development work to improve your Service and Support experience in Q3.

<p>As the old saying goes, Rome was not built in a day. Building world-class online experiences is a complex task that requires time and effort and cannot be rushed. I represent a dedicated team of professionals that is focused on building awesome experiences for you to manage your ServiceNow customer self-service and support needs.   </p>
<p>This Summer, we started building on the existing foundations across <strong>Community, Service Portal, Knowledge, and our Social channels</strong>. Also, to serve our customers faster we kicked off adoption of our emerging technologies including <strong>Mobile, Machine Learning, Idea Management &amp; Virtual Agent</strong>. I am excited to tell you what we have done and reveal to you some of the amazing innovations we have in store for you soon.   </p>
<p>Consider this installment <strong>Episode 1</strong><strong>,</strong> and I hope you follow along as we build something that makes your <em>world of work, work better for you</em>. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Brick by brick:</strong><strong> Layering in Small Incremental Changes </strong> </span></p>
<p>Earlier this year I read every piece of customer feedback that we received via the HI Service Portal. We made customer feedback paramount to our FY19 roadmap for impactful changes that serve our customers faster.  In an agile fashion, we are improving your experience sprint after sprint. Here are some of the things that you (our customer user) asked for and that we improved in July &amp; August.   </p>
<p><strong>Quicker Access to Changes</strong><strong> </strong> </p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW32374009 BCX0" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW32374009 BCX0">We elevated Changes in the left side navigational menu. This will provide you with quicker access to reference key Changes that have been scheduled to your instances. </span></span><span class="EOP SCXW32374009 BCX0"> </span><br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/446cb77cdb2bf3c0d58ea345ca961960.iix" /></p>
<p><strong>Manage Accounts Improvements</strong> <br /> <br />The function to add a new user to HI was hidden under the three dot ellipses. We uplifted this function and made it a button. <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/b5ae773cdbabf3c0d58ea345ca9619c7.iix" /></p>
<p>We installed tool tip text to help you as a Customer Administrator understand how you should assign your HI users.  <br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/300ffb30dbebf3c0d58ea345ca961966.iix" /></p>
<p><strong>Ability to Open Records in a New Tab </strong> </p>
<p>We have implemented the ability to open your list view records in a separate tab. To access this time saving function, use the right click function on your mouse. You will be able to use this function on almost all list views in HI.   <br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/0f5fbbf0dbebf3c0d58ea345ca961942.iix" /></p>
<p><strong>Instance Management Reporting</strong> </p>
<p>We created a report so you could download key information on your instances. Instead of having to cut and paste information from various sources now you can simply run a report from HI to know instance versions, data centers, IP addresses and other critical instance details. </p>
<p><strong>Case Management Reporting</strong> </p>
<p>You can also download a summary of your cases from the Case summary page.  </p>
<p><strong><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/6d4abfb0dbe7f3c0d58ea345ca9619a7.iix" />Version Filtering on ServiceNow Community</strong> </p>
<p>To empower you to find the most relevant information when you are searching for advice or solutions, we have deployed a version filter on Community content.  <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/cceff7b8dbebf3c0d58ea345ca96197a.iix" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Scaling: Innovations in Progress</strong> </span></p>
<p>The Service Management team is also focused on bringing innovation to you so that you can focus on what matters most, for you and your business. </p>
<p><strong>Idea Management: October</strong><strong> </strong> <br /> <br />Got ideas? A new <strong>Ideas Portal</strong> will be hosted on the ServiceNow Community. On this portal you will be able to view and comment on ideas, vote on your favorites, and submit ideas of your own. The top ideas will be reviewed by ServiceNow, and we will communicate back to the community the status of those ideas.  </p>

<p>We have started establishing the groundwork for integrating our Community with Case Management. We understand that when you have a question on the Community you need a response. Our “Close the Loop” Community to Case feature will give you an option to create a Support Case if your question has not received any replies on the Community.  </p>
<p><em>Note: This is a phased roll-out applicable only to known customers. Known customers have the same email in HI as Community.</em></p>
<p><em><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/c62688c1db6337c0d58ea345ca96199e.iix" /></em></p>
<p><strong>Mobile On the Go Experience: October</strong><strong> </strong> </p>
<p>As a busy Admin, it&#39;s hard to keep track of all the notifications and updates from the HI Service Portal so we are launching a mobile on the go HI experience for customer service and support.  </p>
<p><img class="WACImage SCXW21469794 BCX0" src="https://community.servicenow.com/c2b473b8dba3f3c0d58ea345ca96191c.iix" /> <br /><strong>Artificial Intelligence Everywhere</strong> </p>
<p>My colleague Howard Shaw is uber focused on embedding artificial intelligence everywhere and establishing deeper relevance and personalization in everything we do. His first step is to improve the experience and capabilities of Virtual Agent by leveraging the newest NLU (Natural Language Understanding) capabilities in New York.  Next up is to expand our use of AI innovations across the entire service transformation portfolio, so we can provide even better service to our customers. </p>

<p>It truly is an exciting time. If you have a suggestion or would like to give us kudos for the work we have done or are planning to do, please <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/" rel="nofollow">log into HI</a> and use the convenient Feedback button. I personally read every piece of feedback, and the positive ratings with constructive feedback are my favorite way to start the day! </p>
