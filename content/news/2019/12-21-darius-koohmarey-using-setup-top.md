<p>A unique architecture you find with the virtual agent is that of the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/administer/virtual-agent/task/configure-va-setup-topics.html" rel="nofollow">setup topics</a>. These are core components of any conversation, regardless of the specific use case that is being handled. For those unfamiliar with the setup topics, they include a greeting, survey, live agent, explore help, error, closing, fallback and anything else topic. The execute in a specific order in every conversation the user has, beginning with a greeting topic and ending with a closing topic.</p>
<p>You can consider the way the virtual agent converses with users as a larger meta conversation, with the specific conversation topics the user interacts with components of the larger conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you first open the bot, the virtual agent automatically begins by running the greeting topic. After you type your first phrase into the bot, it triggers topic selection via keywords or NLU. This matches you into a specific defined conversation topic, e.g. Open IT Ticket or Check IT Ticket Status. After the specific conversation is complete, the next setup topics around feedback survey, anything else, and closing run.</p>

<p>The important takeaway here is that setup topics abstract out a master conversation into a collection of smaller conversation topics, each with a defined purpose and role in a virtual agent experience. By utilizing setup topics, you can also standardize the core conversational experience across all your specific conversation topics (Open IT Ticket, Check IT Ticket Status). So what setup topics exist, and where do they get configured? As of New York, you can find the setup topics within the general settings module of virtual agent. Each setup topic can be edited within the conversation designer, similar to regular conversation topics.</p>

<p>A description of each setup topic and its goal is provided below:</p>

<p>So why are these setup topics so important to a dynamic virtual agent, and a more enjoyable user experience? The answer is because they can drastically change the key moments of a conversation by providing a dynamic and proactive greeting, while also offering significantly more helpful content incase no matching topics are found. Let&#39;s take a look at these two specific use cases below, which are handled by updating the greeting and fallback topics.</p>
<p>To begin, let&#39;s take a look at what a more dynamic greeting setup topic can look like:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/a2c9f182dbfd0c50190dfb24399619c7.iix" width="376" height="213" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we personalized the initial greeting message to include the time of the day (good morning) as well as the name of the employee (John). You could even create a function that randomly picks a slightly differently worded phrase to further add variation to the experience. In addition to that, we dynamically presented a proactive check status by providing portal links to the users open incidents and requests. Another proactive action we took is printing outage information to the user. Finally, data compliance or corporate regulation can be enforced at the start of each conversation as well, such as a privacy statement.</p>
<p>All these dynamic data points can be configured into the greeting setup conversation topic. Not only is it wise to make the start of the conversation engaging and dynamic, but it is even more important to make the end dynamic as well. Specifically, we want to ensure our bot makes the best effort to find the answer for the customer. This means when the customer types something in that the bot doesn&#39;t have a conversation topic for, we still want to see if there is other content on the instance that might help, like knowledge articles or catalog items.</p>
<p>The easy way to make the bot have a better &#39;fallback&#39; experience then just saying &#39;sorry, i didn&#39;t understand you&#39; is to try adding a proactive contextual search into the experience first. This way, you can take advantage of existing content on the instance without having to rebuild everything as a conversation topic. An example of such an experience is shown below, and an example XML of the topic is also attached to this blog:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/3bd9f182dbfd0c50190dfb24399619d0.iix" width="299" height="263" /></p>
<p>You can also make a change to the topic logic so that it only returns one result with a knowledge snippet. The advantage of this approach is that when the user says the result helped, you can add a record to that specific articles knowledge feedback record. If a user says the search results were not helpful, you can ask them if they want to open an IT ticket or chat with a live agent instead, as seen in the example topic XML attached.</p>
<p>These are just two simple examples of utilizing setup topics such as the greeting and fallback to create a smarter, more dynamic, and proactive virtual agent.</p>
<p>In addition to these topic logic changes to the setup topics, what makes a bot more effectively dynamic? The answer is good underlying data. As we saw from the greeting example, we relied on having up to date outage records. For the fallback topic, it was dependent on knowledge articles and catalog items. In Orlando, we plan to offer KB gap analysis via ML that will help you identify where you are missing content, and where it will have the most impact.</p>
<p>As I&#39;ve written in the past, <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;daac4774db82ff80e0e80b55ca9619f4" rel="nofollow">VA &amp; PI is better together</a>!</p>
