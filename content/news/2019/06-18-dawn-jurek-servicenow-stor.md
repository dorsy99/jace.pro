<p>In this installment of our <a title="NOWSupport best practices series" href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;6e7d6269dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NOWSupport best practices series</a>, we answer some common questions about the ServiceNow Store, and provide a video demo and links to all of the resources you need to get started.</p>
<h3>What do I need to download apps on the ServiceNow Store?</h3>
<p>If your company is a current ServiceNow customer, all you need is an account on HI to download apps. You&#39;ll need the admin role to install them on your instance.</p>
<h3>How can I be sure that the apps I download are safe?</h3>
<p>All applications on the ServiceNow Store are certified, meaning that they&#39;ve been rigorously reviewed and approved by ServiceNow. </p>
<p>We verify that the listing accurately represents the app, and perform a technical review, which includes:</p>
<ul><li>A security review</li><li>An integration review</li><li>Installation testing</li><li>Verification that the app includes end-user documentation</li></ul>
<h3>Can I download ServiceNow applications from the Store?</h3>
<p>Yes! Starting with Madrid, we have begun to migrate ServiceNow applications and integrations to the ServiceNow Store, which allows you to get the newest features between major family releases.</p>
<p>Currently, all <span class="ph">Security Operations</span> applications and supported integrations are available for download. See our post <a title="How to Get the Latest Security Operations and GRC applications" href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;fa6eff4ddb58b3841cd8a345ca961918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">How to Get the Latest Security Operations and GRC applications</a> and watch the video to see demos of various scenarios:</p>
<ul><li>Upgrading your existing application to the next release</li><li>Updating an application you previously downloaded from the ServiceNow Store</li><li>Downloading and installing an application for the first time</li><li>Installing Security Operations integrations </li></ul>
<h3>What does entitlement mean?</h3>
<p>When your company has purchased a valid license for an application, you are entitled to download and install it. When you download an application, you will be prompted to first verify that you have entitlement.</p>
<h3>Can my company sell apps on the ServiceNow Store?</h3>
<p>Companies registered with the <a title="ServiceNow Technology Partner Program" href="https://www.servicenow.com/partners.html#Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Technology Partner Program</a> can list and sell apps and integrations on the store.</p>
