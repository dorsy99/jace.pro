<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For our second sprint, our focus was the following:</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1) Walking through all the configurations under the Project Administration settings in PPM.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 2) Mapping all the roles and security groupings for our users.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Project Administration - Working with our Rego consultant, as we went through each of the settings, for the majority of these settings, we simply reviewed all of the settings and took all the OOTB settings. A couple of notes related to these settings are:</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • As our phase 1 implementation, we are not included the financial, time sheets, or resources, so for all these settings, we left as OOTB.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • We decided to create all our portfolio&#39;s up as simple, so you do have to create budget periods. Since OOTB already had 2019 values, we were good to go. We will have to create 2020 values when we move to PROD and that was added to our PPM deployment list.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • For project preferences, the only check mark we kept was for &#34;Enable altering of planned date(s) for task in WIP/Closed,&#34; all other values we set to no and left unchecked.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • We stayed with the Agile default values</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Timeline Visualization</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • For the CIO Roadmap, we have the panel dates set to end-date.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • For the Demand Back, we have the panel dates set to start date.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • One pointer is that as we were testing the Roadmaps, there is a little tab on the right side of screen. Please understand that if you change those settings, it is a custom config that is applied to the ID. As I was updating the timeline visualizations preference settings, the CIO Roadmap was not updating for my ID, that took a little while to figure out that I had set a custom config on my ID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Security</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As we have been on ITSM for almost two years now, we already have SN Groups set up. Our task was mapping our existing groups to the PPM security groups. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We have our security set as:</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_demand_manager - Our IT Managers, PMO</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_demand_user - All users</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_portfolio_manager - IT Managers, PMO</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_pogram_manager - IT Managers, Supervisors, Project Managers</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_project_maanger - Others as needed</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_project_user - All IS team</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_project _portfolio_user - not assigned</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">resourse_manager - not assigned</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">resourse_user - not assigned</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">pps_resource - not assigned</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tm_test_manager - not-assigned</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tm_tester - not assigned</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it_pps_admin - PMO</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">timecard_admin - not assigned </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">timecard_approver - not assigned</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">timecard_user - not assigned</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We will validate our security settings through our testing and our earlier adopters…</span></p>
