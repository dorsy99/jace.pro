<p>Digital Transformation is fast becoming reality at ServiceNow. The program focuses on identifying processes that can be automated through technology to drive our business goals. It’s an enterprise-wide program, part of the Now on Now initiative to unlock productivity and improve efficiency.  </p>
<p>I am part of the Finance Strategy and Operations team. Our team enables and operationalizes technology to improve Finance and related functions. As a process enabler, I am involved in the execution of the Digital Transformation program for my business partners, including Financial Planning &amp; Analysis.</p>
<p>The digital transformation framework is driven by three transformation imperatives: velocity, experience, and intelligence. The framework encourages the business functions to deep dive into their day-to-day operations and take stock of their processes.</p>
<p>We have been on this journey for over a year now. Because nothing helps deepen knowledge as effectively as sharing it, I wanted to share some of the lessons I’ve learned along the way, including what worked well, where we struggled, and how we managed the transformation process. </p>
<p> <strong>Lesson 1: Transformation process must be business-driven </strong></p>
<p>The exercise of evaluating processes against our imperatives gave Finance the opportunity to connect the dots on the potential for change. we could see what projects had the most direct impact on reaching the business goals.  </p>
<p>In the diagnostic phase, each process was evaluated against the three imperatives using an interactive questionnaire that creates a digital score. We started by completing the assessment, which then sparked discussions among various Finance functions. For example, a process could achieve a different digital score based on who in the value chain was answering the questions. We went through several iterations with the Finance teams on how best to answer the questionnaire, until we took a step back and mapped out the different viewpoints and how they came to be. This refined our understanding and helped improve the framework by building use cases for future conversations.</p>
<p>An important lesson we learned was to be patient. Listen to the business employees’ perspective on the problems they face in their day to day operations. This process produced both anxiety and reluctance, but ultimately there was acceptance by the team.  Their engagement early in the process is critical to truly harnessing the benefits of transforming their work.</p>
<p> <strong>Lesson 2: Strategic alignment ensures technology supports business processes</strong></p>
<p>Digital transformation is not a rigid program, where the company’s vision is translated into mandated IT projects. No one single technology delivers on all three imperatives of digital transformation. Instead, it guided us on realizing the benefits of different technologies and developing a roadmap for adoption. The best combination of tools and processes for a given organization varied. </p>
<p>This approach was initially hard for our business partners to grasp. We had several sessions with the Digital Transformation program management team to understand the full effect of what was being requested. The benefit of the framework exercise was that it encouraged business owners to look beyond the traditional approach of evaluating the business strategy and digital roadmap in silos.  </p>
<p>Finance used the digital transformation framework to build its FY19 strategy. We identified projects on the roadmap that were high in business priority and tied to the evolution of the digital landscape. The rigor of the process helped us deliver on our vision and business objectives. </p>
<p>Throughout the process, we had to remember that the business landscape is made up of people and processes, and technology is the engine fueling these processes. Process re-invention is critical to the success of the Digital Transformation journey.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: It’s critical to track progress and establish accountability</strong></p>
<p>Digital heatmaps were vital to us because they visually represent a digital score for each process. The heatmaps use colors such as green, yellow, and red to give a visual representation of the digital score or the digital maturity of the process.  Every project and improvement release is linked to the digital heatmap.   </p>
<p>A digital score also encouraged accountability; it allowed teams to focus on initiatives that would result in real change. But the score also presented a challenge. Screening a project or enhancement to determine its impact on a digital score could send us down a rabbit hole. Would we overlook an important process improvement opportunity because its projected impact for change on the digital scale wasn’t high enough to warrant a change effort?  </p>
<p>This question led to another question. Were we capturing the processes at the right level to truly reflect daily operations for all the functions in Finance? We ended up recalibrating the questionnaire to better capture business pain points that accurately reflected process improvement opportunities. </p>
<p>We learned that it was important to both track the progress we were making and find ways to make assessments more meaningful as we went along. We fostered a cultural mindset that focuses on engagement and accountability and propels us forward to undertake change.</p>
<p><strong>Positive disruption</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The digital transformation approach has been disruptive, given its emphasis on assessing organizational culture and processes before selecting the appropriate technology. But it has been disruptive in a good way. It has forced Finance to challenge the status quo and ask the right questions of the right people. The digital transformation journey has been nothing short of a rich and exciting experience for all those involved. We are optimistic about the impact of our transformation efforts in the future. </p>
