<p>We are excited about the Madrid release of ITOM as we are taking AIOps to the next level. At ServiceNow, we have been using AIOps and machine learning for years and we are constantly enhancing it with new techniques to improve the operator experience. With Madrid, we are extending our industry-leading AIOps with powerful Alert Intelligence.</p>
<p>The Madrid release enables you to do even more. Here are some of the new features included in Madrid:</p>
<p>• Alert Intelligence <br />• CMDB Browse and Search</p>
<h4>Alert Intelligence</h4>
<p>When a service outage strikes – how long does it take you to work through the thousands of alerts your team is bombarded with as a result of the outage, just to get to the few critical and actionable alerts you need to solve the problem? Estimates indicate it can take up to 4 to 8 hours to resolve an outage with traditional legacy tools and manual processes, time your customers will no longer put up with.</p>
<p>With Alert Intelligence powered with AIOps, you are presented with only the few actionable alerts you need to solve a business service outage and not only that – you get a prioritized list of the impacted business services, past incidents and changes related to the CI in question – and you get it all in one console. No longer do you have to work through several different user interfaces to pull all the essential information you need together to investigate the issue – it’s all there for you and more. You can kick off an automatic remediation with a workflow or you can send the incident over to the right teams to resolve it. Alert Intelligence takes AIOps to the next level using machine learning and analytics and significantly reduces the time it takes you to solve an outage or service degradation. The result? Improved service health, increased operational efficiency, and IT operations processes that scales for the digital future. It’s that simple.</p>

<h3>CMDB Browse and Search</h3>
<p>There is a wealth of valuable information in the CMDB and we know your CMDB is at the heart of your IT Operations excellence.</p>
<p>With enhanced CMDB Browse, we are making critical information available so that when your agents review a CI, they will now be able to also see the past incidents and changes that are associated with the CI. This enhanced view gives them more information into assessing a service degradation issue or an outage.</p>
<p>We have also improved the CMDB Search capability by making it easier to search in general terms so the user can put more free text into their search.</p>
