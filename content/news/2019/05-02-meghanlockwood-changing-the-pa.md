<div id="magicdomid2" class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597">If you are part of the ServiceNow Knowledge Community, chances are you have seen a significant change in interest and adoption over the past 15 months. But as the power of the ServiceNow platform evolves, hard numbers can help bring that growth home. </span></div>
<div id="magicdomid3" class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597"> </span></div>
<div id="magicdomid4" class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597">Today, while 93% of customers have implemented ServiceNow for IT (both ITSM and ITOM), did you know that over 54% have implemented 2&#43; elements of the platform and 12% have implemented 4&#43; platform components? Further, nearly 80% of your peers have a Service Management initiative underway at their business this year.</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid5" class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597">These are just some of the original data points on ServiceNow transformation that Acorio launched in our first-ever global research focused exclusively on ServiceNow clients and prospects earlier this year. </span></div>

Key findings include: <br /></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid9" class="ace-line">
<ul><li><strong><span class="author-281618597 b">The ServiceNow platform is delivering tangible ROI for Digital Transformation efforts</span></strong><span class="author-281618597">: Survey responses found wide-ranging ROI including 77% who say more efficient workflows, 56% driving increased Automation, and 55% who saw a reduced time to address an incident.<br /><br /></span></li><li><strong><span class="author-281618597 b">Underscoring corporate expansion, respondents reported growing roadmaps and project scope</span></strong><span class="author-281618597">: 60% of ServiceNow users reported their ServiceNow strategy changed in the last year. Similarly, tied for the #1 challenge for all ServiceNow users is </span><span class="author-281618597 font-color-000000">roadmap expansion “once one module is implemented, even more departments want us to support them” was the top concern for 45% of responses (tied with overall platform price.) <br /><br /></span></li><li><span class="author-281618597 b"><strong>In the Future, the Customer Comes Second to AI:</strong></span> <span class="author-281618597">Looking toward future trends, Artificial Intelligence (65%) beat out Customer Experience (58%) as the most critical trend of tomorrow.</span></li></ul>
</div>
<div id="magicdomid13" class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597">For over a decade, we’ve talked about Digital Transformation but companies (even in IT and technology departments) were transforming slowly. ServiceNow has accelerated the response of change in the real world through its cloud-native platform and focus on process. Digital change can now be manifested in concrete, time-bound activities, connecting departments with easily configured technology.</span></div>

<h2 id="magicdomid18" class="ace-line"><strong>VIEWS FROM THE TOP: ServiceNow in the C-Suite</strong></h2>
<div class="ace-line"> </div>
<div class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863">When talking about ServiceNow, it’s no longer just the head of IT or the Director of HR weighing in on purchasing decisions. Instead, enterprise software purchases are being vetted and tracked by the C-Suite, from your Chief Transformation or Technology Officers (CTO) to your Chief Executive Officer (CEO). <br /><br />These executive respondents are in the best position to detail what is happening with ServiceNow across their companies, instead of just within silos.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid19" class="ace-line">
<ul><li><strong><span class="author-281618597 b font-color-495863">61%</span></strong><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863"> of C-Suite executives track time to resolve an incident or request.</span></li><li><strong><span class="author-281618597 b font-color-495863">Employee Experience</span></strong><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863"> is a top concern among CHRO’s and other executives.</span></li><li><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863">Technology expertise is </span><strong><span class="author-281618597 b font-color-495863">not a top challenge</span></strong><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863"> when implementing ServiceNow, but the cost of technology is.</span></li><li><strong><span class="author-281618597 b font-color-495863">2019</span></strong><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863"> is the year for increased reporting capabilities, automation and adding new functionality to existing instances.</span></li></ul>
</div>
<div id="magicdomid23" class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863">We asked these same executives to reflect on what their largest challenge areas of ServiceNow were during their implementation. Not a single respondent said that they struggled to integrate ServiceNow with their existing legacy technologies via M&amp;A. This ease-of-integration points to one of the platforms base qualities. Instead of replacing legacy systems, ServiceNow can serve as the single point of view into analytics, dashboards, and communications.</span></div>
<div class="ace-line"> </div>
<div id="magicdomid24" class="ace-line"><span class="author-281618597 font-color-495863">From the view of the C-Suite however, the biggest problem with the ServiceNow implementation was not the technical challenges (3.8%), nor ability to upgrade (3.8%) but the cost of the technology and actual implementation, at a whopping 34.6%.</span></div>
