<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Digitization is transforming the role of the IT Helpdesk and contact center Agents. The demands facing help desk staff are becoming more complex, more varied, and more valuable. The unplanned and traditional appraisal methods to coach and train your people are ineffective improvement tools in today’s fast paced environment. Unfortunately, many organizations are still relying on these outdated methods. See survey results from <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/247212161999185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">BACK2ITSM group</a> on Facebook. </span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The % value shows how coaching is primary done today.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is the problem?</strong></span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The traditional methods are really ineffective for many reasons.</strong></span></p>
<ol class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Supervisors are busy and agents are not getting enough coaching cycles when it’s needed the most.</span></li><li class="graf graf--li"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Coaching is often poorly targeted. Randomly picking a few incidents often misses key issues or opportunities for improvement.</span></li><li class="graf graf--li"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Coaches often approach their work with the wrong mindset and focus on the wrong metrics for improvement.</span></li><li class="graf graf--li"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Appraisal periods are stressful and provide a limited opportunity for improvement feedback.</span></li></ol>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A better way: ServiceNow’s Coaching App</span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We improve our performance through practice and feedback loops, but for real acceleration we need to take a fresh approach that can provide real-time coaching and deliver micro learning to improve the agent’s performance right when it’s needed.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The ServiceNow Coaching app allows managers to set triggers for coaching moments on any process in ServiceNow platform, and then deliver targeted coaching when those conditions are met to enforce best practices and improve an agent’s performance.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Coaching can be applied to any task-based and non-task-based process (Incident, Problem, Change, PPM, SDLC, custom apps).</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/c28db885db793744feb1a851ca961973.iix" width="723" height="367" /></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Who are the Coaches?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Coaching module is designed to be a lightweight process. Various people can play the role of coach. Large organizations able to invest in the concept of coaching may choose to have dedicated coaches. You may choose to configure coaches for geographical regions — the local IT manager assumes the role of coach for his local team. Teams with specific technical expertise may be coached by seasoned database administrators or router gurus, for example.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Who are the Trainees?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A trainee could be any employee in the organization. For example, in the IT org, it will be an agent working on resolving incidents or fulfilling requests. In customer service, it could be a call center agent or field service agent. In projects, it could be your product managers.</span></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Coaching Opportunities</span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Coaching opportunities define the critical moments within the process. In the previous incident management example, three coaching opportunities for the “first response”, “transfer of incident” and “proposing solution” would be created.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Identify critical moment for success</strong></span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are all familiar with process flows or diagrams that map out the various stages of a process. When designing an adoption of coaching, an early stage is to review the process flow and identify the critical moments for success.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--empty"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/d14ab045dbb53744feb1a851ca96198b.iix" width="718" height="305" /></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Coaching Assessment</span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Assessments are the task-based records that are assigned to the coach group. They have fields that allow the coach to offer feedback for the trainee along with a simple scoring system. Once a critical moment has been reached in the process, an assessment is created for the coach to offer feedback. The coach is now able to offer feedback to the trainee and assign additional micro learning using KB, Videos, or best practices.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In order to track performance over time, the coach would rate the quality of the data at this point in the process. The coach can select from a pre-defined list or use a granular survey questionnaire to provide the trainee with a data point, tracked over time to ensure that performance is being incrementally increased.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Virtual Coaching</span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Supervisors and team leaders may struggle to keep up with all coaching task on time, as they juggle meetings, administrative duties, and special projects. This is where inbuilt Virtual Coach capability will help save a ton of time for the team leaders (Coaches). The Virtual Coach will automatically deliver contextual learning content (KB article, videos, best practice tips), can rate the performance based on the criteria and can move the assessment task to the resolved state automatically — all without any involvement from a real coach.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Coaching Insights: Prebuilt Coach and Trainee Dashboards</strong></span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Use the Coach dashboard to get insight into an agent’s performance and see how it compares against multiple performance indicators. You can then target coaching interventions at the topics that will most improve agent performance.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Coach and trainee can leverage the out of the box integration with Surveys and Assessment integration to provide more granular feedback and identify items that need future follow-ups or additional training outside of a coaching assessment task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Evaluate Coaching ROI</strong></span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One of the more straightforward ways to evaluate the effectiveness of an agent-coaching program is to look at how performance evolves over time. For experienced agents who have been in their current role for more than six months, metrics such as average time to resolve a ticket (MTTR), first-contact resolution (FCR), or customer satisfaction (CSAT) should show a broadly upward trend. At the same time, performance differences among agents should gradually decrease.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A gap of much more than 30 to 40 percentage points between agents in the top performance quartile and the bottom suggests weaknesses in the coaching frequency.</span></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Coaching use cases and sample best practice contents:</strong></span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The coaching demo data that you can choose to install with the application provides lots of good examples of coaching across Incident, Problem, Change, Survey, HR, and customer service.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Coach users new to a process.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a. As your service management capability matures, you will add new processes.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Engineers that are experienced in Incident management will start to interact with Change management processes. Consider offering intensive coaching to users that move to new roles and responsibilities.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. Help users that have performance problems.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a. Employees sometimes struggle to perform to acceptable performance levels — you might find your coaching loops uncover undesirable behavior like incidents with poor resolution information or change requests with no risk assessments.</span></p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Coaching module facilitates the coaching of employees on their work through the use of coaching opportunities (critical moments in a process) that can be conditionally configured. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Combined with your ability to influence the outcome of the process by coaching from the beginning, the process is a powerful catalyst for improvement.</span></p>
