<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My colleague recently posted a video on Facebook of his daughter singing along to her favorite song.  That in itself wouldn&#39;t be noteworthy, this type of thing happens all the time.  What made this post different was the situation - he was driving.  Well, in fact he wasn&#39;t driving, the car was driving itself.  He had put the car on auto pilot so he could safely capture this magical memory with his daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To me, this is a very relevant example of artificial intelligence automating a task (a rather common and important one) and giving us time back to focus on something more meaningful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of our lives both at home and in the workplace.  One popular example that you&#39;ll find in both worlds is the chatbot.  Many chatbots are powered by a subcategory or AI called Natural Language Understanding (NLU), which helps bridge the gap between humans and machines by empowering machines to take the unstructured way in which we speak and translate that into something the machine can understand.  <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;3811fdd8dbd26308656a5583ca9619a8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">You can read more about NLU here.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As of the New York release, the Now Platform has native NLU capabilities available to enhance the experience employees and customers have when interacting with the Virtual Agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let&#39;s take a look at a few of the enhancements.</span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/b7dd0e7adbd00cd013b5fb24399619be.iix" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">First and foremost, NLU allows the Virtual Agent to move from a keyword conversation discovery model to a more natural experience through intent matching.  This change exponentially increases adoption because the Virtual Agent is more likely to align with the requestor on what they are looking to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The NLU model&#39;s ability to understand and extract entities<strong> </strong>streamlines the conversation between the employee and the Virtual Agent using a technique called &#34;slot filling&#34;.  For example, if the employee types in &#34;I&#39;d like to update the email address in my profile&#34; the NLU model would understand that the intended action is to update their profile but more specifically that they&#39;d want to update the email address in their profile.  This will allow the Virtual Agent to skip the portion of the conversation where it asks what portion of the profile they want to update.  The less questions the Virtual Agent has to ask to get to the right resolution the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Virtual Agent can also seamlessly switch from one conversation to another.  For example, from a request to opening an IT ticket to a conversation about ordering a new mouse or from a conversation about requesting some time off to quickly asking the Virtual Agent to show them the corporate holiday schedule and then returning to the initial time off request conversation.  This ability to bounce back and forth leads to more productive conversations - and simulates the disorganized way <em>some </em> humans communicate information (present company excepted).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The reason people go to a chatbot or the Virtual Agent in the first place is that they are looking for the quickest and easiest road to resolution.  How does NLU enhance the experience?</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It creates more on-ramps to simply get on the right road, </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It provides the opportunity to ask for directions without slowing down</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It identifies short-cuts and creates express lanes, </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All of which gets the employees and customers to where they want to be, in a position to focus on more meaningful things, in a more timely manner.</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ultimately, the addition of NLU to the Virtual Agent will make it the road more traveled for your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This increased adoption will manifest itself in increased organizational productivity - or perhaps more time for invaluable social media activity.  The possibility of bringing the world more videos of children singing their favorite songs cannot be overlooked.</span></p>
