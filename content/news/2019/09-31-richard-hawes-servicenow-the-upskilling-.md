<p>ServiceNow makes work, work better for people and we recognize that the world of work in DevOps is more about process, and especially more about people, than tools. That&#39;s why ServiceNow, in collaboration with other sponsors including the Continuous Delivery Foundation, is supporting the DevOps Institute “<a title="Survey" href="https://info.devopsinstitute.com/2020-upskilling-survey-sn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">2020 Upskilling: Enterprise DevOps Skills Survey</a>”. This will once again help the community measure the trends and progress of DevOps skillset development, building upon the 1,600-plus survey responses from the 2019 benchmark report.</p>
<p>In order to get a clearer picture of where the IT skills gaps are and what areas we all need to focus on most, please <a title="Survey" href="https://info.devopsinstitute.com/2020-upskilling-survey-sn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">take the survey </a><strong>and share it with your friends and colleagues!</strong></p>
<p>Last year, DevOps Institute published the first-ever “<a title="2019 Upskilling Report" href="https://devopsinstitute.com/industry-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Upskilling: Enterprise DevOps Skills Report</a>” and the results were very deep and insightful. The 2019 Upskilling report provided the DevOps community with a solid benchmark on the state of DevOps skills across those categories. But once is not enough in a rapidly changing skills landscape. It’s time to do it again in order to analyze and validate the data year over year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2019 Upskilling Report provided a benchmark upon which to measure future patterns and trends by identifying which skills are considered &#34;must-have&#34;, &#34;nice to have&#34; and &#34;not important&#34; across roles, regions, and perspectives. For example, the categories of Process, Automation, and Soft/Human skills were shown to be of equal importance.</p>
<p><strong>Why Take the Upskilling: Enterprise DevOps Skills Survey?</strong></p>
<p>Upskilling is on the tip of a lot of people’s tongues these days, and on the minds of large organizations (<a title="Amazon Upskilling" href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-pledges-upskill-100000-us-employees-demand-jobs-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">just look at the investment Amazon made this Summer</a>). But, how do hiring managers know which skills are considered “must-have”, “nice to have” and “not as important” these days? What are the hiring trends within the industry including the most sought-after roles and plans? With the vast array of tools, technologies, process frameworks, and human/soft skills, it is daunting to try to establish a meaningful enterprise upskilling program or personal upskilling strategy.</p>
<p><a title="Upskilling survey" href="https://info.devopsinstitute.com/2020-upskilling-survey-sn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Upskilling Survey</a> is meant to help empower and advance human transformation by identifying the skills and knowledge that lead to ideas and learning for DevOps success. ServiceNow is proud to partner with the DevOps Institute as they look forward to building on the SKIL Framework (Skill, Knowledge, Ideas, Learning) and the success of the 2019 benchmark report to offer new and updated insights on the trends in DevOps skills sets from a year-over-year perspective.</p>
<p><strong>The <a title="Upskilling Survey" href="https://info.devopsinstitute.com/2020-upskilling-survey-sn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">2020 Upskilling: Enterprise DevOps Skills survey</a> is active through December 20, 2019, and the second annual report will be published in early 2020. </strong>You can also hear from the CEO of the DevOps Institute, Jayne Groll, as she explains the importance of this benchmark survey in <a title="Video" href="https://devopsinstitute.wistia.com/medias/delbxi9uo6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this video</a>.<br /> <br />Last, but not least, let’s not forget that upskilling is a human endeavor.
