<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) market has seen double-digit growth for the past few years and the market is consolidating with two dominant players, VMware and Nutanix.  With the fast-paced changes in today’s IT environments, driven by trends such as HCI, cloud adoption, containers, and serverless computing, a service-aware CMDB is more pertinent than ever.  Service uptime is no longer a goal, it is a fundamental expectation and when mission-critical services go down, customers looking for near real-time visibility to the infrastructure stack and would like to understand the application service impact.    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With the July content release, ITOM Discovery solution will add support Nutanix HCI. The goal of discovery solution is to provide end to end visibility to Nutanix key infrastructure elements like the Nutanix cluster, hosts, virtual machine instances, controller VMs, storage pools, and storage containers. Discovery also pulls tags and provide near real-time visibility to HCI infrastructure.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The VMware vSphere- ESX/ESXi and Nutanix AHV hypervisors discovery are fully supported with July content release and the discovery solution can connect to multiple PRISM central instances via vendor-approved REST APIs to collect this valuable configuration data and its dependencies.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Several design partner customers participated in the validation of the discovery solution. One of the early adaptors of this discovery content commented on the outcomes achieved from this Integration. <em><strong>“ServiceNow is the data platform for IT and the data in CMDB is the connecting glue which unlocks multiple outcomes. Nutanix data in CMDB is absolutely critical for the automation of IT workflows and governance.”  </strong></em></span></p>
