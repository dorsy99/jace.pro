<p><strong>I just want to get this in early. Will custom apps under this tool be charged for custom tables?</strong> -- Joshua Boley<br /> Hey Joshua, yes any custom table would be implicated for app engine licensing. Caveat there, is that some applications that you purchase may come with a sub-set of available custom table licenses. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="5818c0f7db2008106072ff78bf96191b"> </div>

<p><strong>Back to the list filters, since you can make filters available for everyone, can you also make favorites available for all users?</strong> -- Daniel Anderson<br /> YES! Favorites are stored as a user preference, but there is a way to make them available to all users. Create your new favorite. Head over to sys_ui_bookmarks.list in the filter navigator and find that favorite. Take the &#34;User&#34; away. and save. Remember, any users that have their user preferences set will have to have them cleared to see the pushed faves.

<p><strong>How do you use the Guided App Creator to populate Service Catalog entries?</strong> -- Harriet Kim<br /> We discussed this in the video. Guided App Creator is available to start a new app/scope. You can build catalog items within that, but there are no explicit features in GAC to build catalog items. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="981880f7db2008106072ff78bf9619da"> </div>
<p><strong>Can you repeat how you saved the query as a bookmark?</strong> -- Penny Roberts<br /> Sure thing! Right click on the top gray border (The one that has the count of records in the list) and click &#34;Create Favorite&#34;. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>

If you wanted to enhance the UX and do it on scan, check out how to use client-side scripting to help with the mobile app. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-mobile/page/script/client-scripts/reference/r_MobilePlatformMigrationImpacts.html -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a418c0f7db2008106072ff78bf961920"> </div>
<p><strong>can you show the mobile app result&gt;</strong> -- Bill Cross<br /> I tried, but for some reason it wasn&#39;t showing on my phone. I&#39;ve done it in the past and it&#39;s quite simple. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a818c0f7db2008106072ff78bf96191d"> </div>
<p><strong>How do you use the Guided App Creator when integrating ServiceNow with external applications via REST API?</strong> -- Harriet Kim<br /> You can build your integration within the scope created by Guided App Creator. Start by creating the app (scope) and then build your integration in Studio (or Flow Designer) around that. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="d01880f7db2008106072ff78bf9619d7"> </div>
<p><strong>Good Morning Chuck, Thank you for the Dummies book.</strong> -- Ray Roulstonr<br /> You are very welcome. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="d018c0f7db2008106072ff78bf96191a"> </div>
<p><strong>Will the roles created here impact License</strong> -- Chandra Sangoju<br /> ey Chandra, creating a role doesn&#39;t by itself impact licensing. It would be the people you give the roles to that would impact the licenses. For instance, if you give a user &#34;itil&#34; role and they log in, they become a paid user of the IT Service Management application. Same with custom application tables and custom roles that go with that table. The custom role itself doesn&#39;t cause any license issues, but when you give that role to an application/table and give a user that role, you would have a user count of (1) for that table/app now. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="dc1880f7db2008106072ff78bf9619d9"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we expose the filtered list via API?</strong> -- Don Sur<br /> Hey Don, I&#39;m afraid this isn&#39;t a straightforward scenario, so my answer will be more generic. You can use the encoded query to help build the REST API from another system by right-clicking the breadcrumb to grab the encoded query. Can you elaborate on the scenario you&#39;re thinking of? -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="dc18c0f7db2008106072ff78bf96191c"> </div>
<p><strong>So.... total newb here. Probably should have asked when we started but what does this app you guys are making actually do?</strong> -- Andrew Dennis<br /> It&#39;s a simple webinar tracking app. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="e818c0f7db2008106072ff78bf96191f"> </div>
<p><strong>where is the mobile</strong> -- Bill Cross<br /> Bill, Mobile can be managed/built within the Studio application in the SN platform. There are specific mobile features that can be managed there along with the overall desktop app that you would build. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
