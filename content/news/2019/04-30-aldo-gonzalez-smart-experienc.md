<p>Volteo was founded by ServiceNow customers that built some of the biggest and most successful ServiceNow deployments on the planet. Since our founding, we’ve shared our expertise with more than 150 customers around the world, and in the process, have become a Gold Tier leader ranked in the top-10 for customer satisfaction by ServiceNow.</p>
<p>Although we are proud of these achievements, there’s a lot more to Volteo than credentials and experience in the market. Volteo is committed to simple, smart customer experiences made possible by IoT and service management. We are not alone in recognizing that IoT will drive profound change, but we are among the first to recognize that IoT solutions will transform service management for everyone and everything in the enterprise.</p>
<p>You may have encountered Smart Building technology. But what if everything in that Smart Building was modeled and managed with ServiceNow?</p>
<p>You may have read about how IoT will transform Retail operations. But what if the IoT infrastructure was managed with ServiceNow? What if a Smart City was managed through ServiceNow? What if I told you we’ve shown a Smart City dashboard at Mobile World Congress?</p>
<p>These examples are real, taken from real customer engagements.</p>
<p>Let me share what we have learned.</p>
<p>IoT is about making things smart. Making things smart also makes them information technology assets, and information technology assets need to be service managed. As businesses develop and deploy IoT solutions, every business will have to accept and deal with managing these assets. But part of what makes these assets cost effective is their price point, and a service management solution that makes them cost prohibitive won’t work. We’ve learned how to design cost-effective service managed IoT solutions with ServiceNow.</p>
<p>IoT solutions start with focus, and that’s important. You have to start with a bounded scope, or you’ll never see a measurable return on your investment. But you also have to step back from your immediate goals to fully understand your opportunity. This isn’t new; ServiceNow is a powerful tool and, time and again, we help our customers apply a service-oriented mindset to fully appreciate and capitalize on ServiceNow can do for their operations. We’ve learned how to help customers extend their thinking beyond traditional IT services and infrastructure to incorporate IoT opportunities.</p>

<p>IoT solutions are being built in silos. Again; this isn’t new, we’ve worked with so many customers to engage multiple departments to fully leverage ServiceNow capabilities through proper governance models to create ROI opportunities compelling enough to break down silos. As IoT brings intelligence to new parts of your business, it is essential to expand your thinking to preclude the next round of silos.</p>
<p>IoT success requires fresh thinking about building solutions blended with the tried and true principles of solution design and service management. It may be different, but it doesn’t have to be a scary process with sound tools and infrastructure and an experienced partner to work with you on your ServiceNow journey.</p>
<p>Volteo is excited to be a part of your ServiceNow journey with you. If you are attending Knowledge 19 in Las Vegas, Please, come visit us at our booth #537. We’d be delighted to talk with you about our experiences in service management for traditional information systems and IoT. And be sure to attend our Theater Session in the ExpoNow hall #TN1807: Bring Service Management to IoT, where you can hear us present about this topic in person. Looking forward to seeing you all there!</p>
