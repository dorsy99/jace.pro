<p>In Madrid, we continue to make prioritizing and responding to security incidents and vulnerabilities faster and easier with new enhancements to Security Operations.</p>
<p>For Security Incident Response, we’ve added the ability to create security playbooks using Flow Designer. This feature of the Now Platform lets you create end‑to‑end workflows with no code and using natural language without having to develop complex features and integrations.</p>
<p>The easy-to-use interface of Flow Designer allow you to create flows (playbooks), subflows (child playbooks), and actions (automation tasks with 3<sup>rd</sup> party products/services) for Security Incident Response. Subflows and actions can be used in multiple different playbooks to you can create them once and use them multiple times.</p>
<p>Pre-built flows include phishing response playbooks, threat intelligence lookups, and containment tasks. You can also use ServiceNow Integration Hub to integrate your third-party security tools.</p>

<p>Vulnerability Response sees two new features: Exploit Enrichment and persona-based Performance Analytics dashboards for the vulnerability manager and remediation specialist.</p>
<p>Exploit Enrichment brings in exploit data from your vulnerability scanner or Shodan for improved prioritization of vulnerable items. Our customers frequently deal with vulnerabilities number in the hundreds of thousands or even millions, so prioritization is key. Prior to the Madrid release, we provided prioritization via the risk score calculator that used the CVSS score of the vulnerability and the criticality of the impacted asset. Now we can include whether or not an exploit exists in the wild, the skill level required, and the attack vector to better indicate how dangerous a particular vulnerability is.</p>
<p>Vulnerability risk scores now feed into a new risk rating indicator included in the enhanced Performance Analytics dashboards for Vulnerability Response. These dashboards are designed to align to the vulnerability lifecycle, from asset identification to enumeration to prioritization to remediation. Each stage has its own set of metrics for visibility and performance tracking.</p>
<p>In addition, these dashboards have two distinct personas: the vulnerability manager and the remediation specialist. The vulnerability manager can see the overall picture of risk due to vulnerabilities, team performance, service owners, and exception handling. The dashboard can be filtered to quickly drill down into detailed data.</p>

<p>The remediation specialist dashboard is more targeted, focusing on what is key to the individual and their immediate team. It shows vulnerabilities by state, risk rating, or target remediation date so that responders can focus their efforts on the most critical assignments.</p>

<p>A final important update for Madrid is that Security Operations applications are now available for download and update exclusively via the <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Store.</a> Select “Security Operations” under Security and Risk in the store’s left-hand navigation to see all of the applications, including third-party integrations.</p>
