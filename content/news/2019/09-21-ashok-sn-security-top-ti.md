<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>First things first</strong></span></p>
<p>The Security Top Tips blog series provides practical security advice and describes the tools available in the Now Platform® to help you keep your data safe.</p>
<p>ServiceNow provides a powerful, scalable platform that you can use to store and process almost any type and amount of data, for any number of purposes. But with that enormous potential comes a responsibility to ensure the data remains safe at all times.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the service has been designed from the ground up to be secure by default, but the story doesn’t—and shouldn’t—end there. Although we do our utmost to provide best-in-class security for our environments, customers also have a crucial role to play in ensuring the data they store is protected from unauthorized access. It may seem like trying to find your way through a maze, but we’re here to help guide you.</p>
<p>The first step is understanding that ServiceNow (as data processor) and the customer (as data controller) have distinct roles, which combine to provide complete security coverage. This is known as a Shared Responsibility model – but what does this actually mean?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Stronger together</strong></span></p>
<p>An easy way to understand this is with a simple analogy: we provide a box and secure it (<em>hosting</em>), and you, as our customer, decide what is put in the box and who can access it (<em>storing</em>). The diagram below shows each of our responsibilities, and how we must work together to ensure a stronger, more effective security posture.</p>
