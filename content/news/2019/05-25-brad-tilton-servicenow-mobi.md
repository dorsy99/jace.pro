<p>ServiceNow released a new mobile app and functionality with the Madrid release that includes offline support, push notifications, and other enhanced capabilities. It allows you a lot of control over the user experience and allows for configuration through studio. There is a lot of information and tutorials out there around how to configure it, but I thought I&#39;d try centralizing everything I know about into one post. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-mobile/page/administer/tablet-mobile-ui/concept/get-started-end-user.html" rel="nofollow">Mobile Docs</a> - The official documentation for the mobile functionality<br /><br /></li><li><a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/blog.do?p&#61;/tags/mobile/" rel="nofollow">Developer Blogs</a> - Introducing the functionality to developers and diving into mobile<br /><br /></li><li><a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/trainlist/app_store_learnv2_mobileapps_madrid_mobile_applications?v&#61;madrid" rel="nofollow">Mobile Applications Developer Course</a> - This is a very well-done self-paced training course you can complete in a developer instance<br /><br /></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#61;PLCOmiTb5WX3qmxXoy4y-UGnTQOhl2vVc1" rel="nofollow">Getting Started with Mobile Youtube Series</a> - A new series of 10 short youtube videos around using the new mobile functionality and building your own applets</li></ul>
<p><br />Between all of those resources you should have a pretty good base to start from for building out your mobile functionality. If you went to Knowledge19 you also have access to most of the presentations and labs from the conference, including my <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_article&amp;sys_id&#61;5f46ab5cdb9d3b0422e0fb24399619c2" rel="nofollow">CCW0652 - Deliver a Killer Mobile Experience for your Custom App</a> which goes into a couple of more advanced topics like scripted actions and grouped lists.</p>
<p><br />Is there a good mobile resource that I&#39;ve left out? Let me know in the comments!</p>
