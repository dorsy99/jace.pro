<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Compliance and security hygiene go hand in hand. Lack of visibility to the deployed and expiring TLS certificates results in service outages and data breaches. The latest data breach from the largest consumer credit reporting company says “TLS certificate had expired about 10 months before the breach occurred, meaning that encrypted traffic was not being inspected throughout that period”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Certificate Inventory and Management solution provide a platform-centric approach to the lifecycle management of TLS certificates. This solution combined with task fulfillment can provide a methodical approach to the request and renewal management of expired TLS certificates. Automating manual tasks like a request for new certificates and renewal of expired certificates increases the productivity of the public-key infrastructure (PKI) team by ~30% and helps to digitize their manual workflows. Below are the key customer outcomes realized by the newly introduced cert management solution.</span></p>
