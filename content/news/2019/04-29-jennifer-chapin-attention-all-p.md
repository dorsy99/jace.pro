<p>Hello all Pre-Conference training attendees!</p>
<p>We are one week from kicking things off in Las Vegas and wanted to pass along a quick note to you.  One of the most common questions we get following pre-conference training at Knowledge is, “What sessions should I sign up for now that I have completed training?” </p>
<p>In order to help you build out your Knowledge agenda with relevant content, we have prepared a list of recommended sessions that will complement the training you complete next Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what to do:<br /></strong></p>
<ol><li>Find the training course you are registered for in the attached deck “Recommended Sessions at K19 for PreCon&#34;</li><li>Note the session ID for the recommended session you want to add</li><li>Head to the <a href="https://www.servicenowevents.com/knowledge2019/event_agenda" rel="nofollow">Content Catalog</a> to search for and add these sessions to your agenda*   </li></ol>
<p>*<em>Please note these sessions are first come first served, but don’t fret if your session is sold out.  You are welcome to drop by at the scheduled time and see if seats become available at the session. Or better yet, we encourage you to chat with your instructor when you get to Knowledge and they will be able to recommend some additional sessions that may be a fit for you!</em>  </p>
<p>Thank you and we look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas! </p>
<p>The Pre-Conference training team</p>
