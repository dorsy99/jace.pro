<p>TLDR;</p>
<p>1. This module was created a long time ago and there is no active enhancement planned in near term roadmap.</p>
<p>2. If you have enhancement suggest then use the &#34;Idea Portal&#34; link available on community to submit your idea.</p>
<p>3 If you are using Managed docs and would like to share your experience and use cases then please add them to the comments area so that it can help other people in the community.</p>
