<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Okay, so we are now in full implementation mode. A few of the key items we have completed are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">• Project kick-off - I included our presentation with scope statement</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • Upgraded to London.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • Activated our PPM module in our DEV environment.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • Started meeting with our Rego consultant on a weekly bases.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> • Grooming stories for each Sprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In our Analysis / Validation Sprint we focused on our future workflows for our phase 1. Our key focus was on understanding the delta to our current project managers and project leadership. For us, we have an established Idea / Demand / Project process, so our delta is very limited. Obviously, our largest delta is moving to a new tool set, so our scope for phase one is limited to a migration effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our shop is new to formal project management and we depend on our analyst and technical resources to provide project leadership on the majority of our projects. As we are building project management capability and muscle, we have only four artifacts that we require for our projects: </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1. A light weigh business case, this is just what it sounds like, the what, the why, and the how of our work. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 2. A milestone and phases of how the work is going to be accomplished. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 3. Issue list for tracking whatever comes up and who is responsible and target dates.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 4. Finally, we have a &#34;progress update.&#34; This is a simple spreadsheet of what you did this week, what is planned, and what impediments are you having.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our plan is to not change our big four artifacts, just change the tool we are using.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After our initial review, we have made a couple of decisions related to our initial scope and configuration.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1) We are limiting the number of Application Portfolios to just three. We are small shop, so we are aligning three portfolios with our IS senior leadership team. We did model a more business unit strategy, however for our initial migration, everyone agreed we should follow the keep it simple strategy.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 2) We are not going to implement any of the time management, resources, or financial components, so we are going to update all our forms for idea, demand, and projects to hide all the fields and tabs that we are not leveraging in our phase 1. We created a story for our project form to hide these fields and tabs that are not part of our phase 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We have had two requests from our leadership team that we are going to pull into our sprints to deliver value more quickly. No problem, we are using scrum and sprints and have been able to come up with a plan to address these changing requirements.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1) We had planned to not expose Ideas to the larger organization to much later in a phase two. We have rethought that strategy and are planning to leverage our Service Portal and expose Ideas as part of our phase 1. Will group our Idea stories in a phase 1.1 after we move PPM to our PROD environment and have an initial early adopters for the base project management functionality. In our initial idea process, as we review, we will designate one of our IS managers are demand managers to review the ideas and create the appropriate demand.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 2) We have also decided to accelerate our initial implementation and are targeting moving PPM to our PROD environment much sooner that we had thought. Based on business demand, we are initiating a large 18 month program and want to leverage PPM for this program. We will treat this program and projects as an early adopter program as will continue to develop our documentation and educational material.</span></p>
