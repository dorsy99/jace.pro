<p>In August, as part of a <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_event&amp;sys_id&#61;169b4b61db682f8ca39a0b55ca9619a7" rel="nofollow">Performance Analytics and Reporting Office Hours</a>, we covered Cascading Interactive Filters. Cascading Interactive Filters are essentially a group of multiple reference filters together in one block. Each level depends on the previous selection.</p>
<p>These are incredibly useful for fixed hierarchies (e.g., Country/Province/City) and dependent values (e.g., Group/Member or Location/People in Location).</p>
<p>The presentation starts at about 2:45 in the recording:</p>
