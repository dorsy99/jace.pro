<p>When managing organizational change during your ServiceNow implementation, effective and targeted communication is critical to ensure that the people in your organization aren’t simply <em>aware</em> of your project and how it will change their work, but are <em>convinced</em> to actively support and commit to the change.</p>
<p>To help you do this well, we’ve highlighted four questions to consider when building an organizational change management (OCM) communication plan:</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>1. What is an OCM communications plan?</h4>
<p><strong>An organizational change management (OCM) communication plan is a documented strategy for how you will tell your organization about the changes that are occurring as part of implementing ServiceNow</strong>. A good OCM communication plan details how you will provide information about your ServiceNow project – and why it’s beneficial – to the right people at the right time.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>2. What do you need to include in an OCM communications plan?</h4>
<p>The best OCM communication plans define six key items:</p>

<h4>3. How do I build an OCM communication plan?</h4>
<p>Follow these four steps to make sure you involve the right people at the right time and finish with an approved plan that considers all items defined in question 2:</p>

<h4> </h4>
<h4>4. What does a good OCM communications plan look like?</h4>
<p>The most effective OCM communication plans are built in a project plan format that includes information across all plan components in one place and can be easily updated to track communications efforts over time. We recommend the format below (populated with example information) and have built an example <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/success/champion/communication-plan-template.html" rel="nofollow">Communication Plan Template</a> that you can download and modify to build your own plan.</p>
