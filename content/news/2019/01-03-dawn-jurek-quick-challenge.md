<h3><strong>A great way to come up to speed quickly or fill in holes in your knowledge!</strong></h3>
<p>These tidbits—and lots more essential information about the Now platform—are presented in the <a title="ServiceNow Foundations Videos" href="community?id&#61;community_article&amp;sys_id&#61;a2dc2a65dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96197e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Foundations Videos</a> collection on the Community. The collection was designed specifically to introduce new users to the Now Platform. We’ve recently updated many of these videos to the London release. Those that weren’t updated—because the user interface hasn’t changed and they’re still accurate—will be updated, as needed, for future releases.</p>
<p>Here’s an illustration of <em>base tables</em> from the table extension discussion in <a title="Getting Started | Tables, Records, and Fields" href="https://youtu.be/a7Nrz0OU8XM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Getting Started | Tables, Records, and Fields</a>:</p>
<p><img src="e99f190ddbf2af00f0612183ca961971.iix" /></p>
<p>The videos in this collection are grouped by topic into series:</p>
<p><img src="a9c8b1cddbbaaf00f0612183ca9619b6.iix" /></p>
<p>It takes about 3.5 hours to watch all videos in the collection, but you can view them one at a time or in small batches. It’s the perfect activity for when you have a few minutes between meetings or just need a break from your regular work.</p>
<p>This collection also appears as the <a title="ServiceNow Foundations eLearning" href="https://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/foundations-elearning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Foundations eLearning</a> course on the <a title="ServiceNow Training and Certification" href="https://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Training and Certification</a> webpage. It’s recommended as a prerequisite to the <a title="ServiceNow Fundamentals" href="https://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/training-paths/system-administration-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Fundamentals</a> course. When you take the Fundamentals course, the assumption is that you already know the material presented in the Foundations eLearning course. These videos may also be helpful as a review if you’re preparing to take the <a title="ServiceNow Certified System Administrator" href="https://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/certified-system.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Certified System Administrator</a> exam.</p>
