<p>Today, we launched the re-implementation of Virtual Agent in the HI Service Portal (take a look at our previous <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;3d9fe366db044854190dfb243996198b" rel="nofollow">blog</a> posting on this from last week).  With this comes the enablement of <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/natural-language-understanding-rn.html" rel="nofollow">newly available Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities in the New York release</a>.</p>
<p>We’re excited to be the first to showcase this technology and hope it will increase Virtual Agent’s overall intelligence and ability to comprehend more questions.  NLU should provide an improved experience with personalization and a more natural, conversational flow.</p>
<p>Here’s the first 11 conversations we’ve activated in Virtual Agent with NLU:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Personalized Opening Greeting</strong> – VA will greet you by name and let you know if you have any open cases</li><li><strong>Update Notification Preferences</strong> – Review and revise how and when you receive messages and choose the notifications that are most important to you</li><li><strong>Manage Plugins</strong> – Request to activate available Plugins</li><li><strong>Create Case</strong> – Help with creating a new case in a simple form</li><li><strong>Submit a Catalog Request</strong> – Search the Service Catalog for specific actions that you need or call one out by name</li><li><strong>Change HI Password</strong> – Help with changing your password to the HI Service Portal</li><li><strong>View Open Changes</strong> – Open changes that might need your attention</li><li><strong>Knowledge Conference</strong> – Learn about the latest upcoming Knowledge Conference, sign up for updates, or find where presentations to past conferences are located</li><li><strong>Request to zBoot an instance</strong> – Submit a request for a zBoot of your instances</li><li><strong>Request to rename an instance</strong> – Submit a request to rename one of your instances</li><li><strong>Live Agent</strong> – This is a new capability in the New York release, and we’re trying to put the procedures in place for bringing on live Support assistance via chat. This channel doesn’t yet exist, but our hope is to get this going soon (planned for 2020).  At a minimum, now VA can at least provide an answer and a link to more help if someone is looking for live support (previously, it would just say “I don’t understand” and leave the user without a next step).</li></ul>

<p>Now that the first phase is available, we’re working on the next phase, with another 8 (or so) conversations, which we hope to release in just a few weeks.  In fact, there’s an entire roadmap plan of additional capabilities we’ll continue to add…our goal is to evolve Virtual Agent into a very useful tool!</p>
<p>Virtual Agent’s abilities and intelligence will continue to improve as we go, and we’ll continue to train it to understand more variations of how to ask the same question, or in “NLU-speak” – utterances.  The continual training will enable the NLU confidence scores (that it understood the correct intent) to improve.</p>
<p><strong>Please give the Virtual Agent a go and tell us what you think. </strong> We’d love to hear your experiences, whether it was helpful, or any suggestions on how to make it better. You can comment below or write us a suggestion through the feedback mechanism in the HI Service Portal. Happy virtual conversations!</p>
