<p>Getting users the roles they need is a company-wide hassle<span class="ng-binding">—y</span>ou have to ask the user&#39;s manager for approval, then ask the System Administrator for approval, then wait for the System Administrator to update the user&#39;s record—all over email. There has to be a way to automate this process!</p>
<p>Then you have a brilliant idea. How about a Service catalog item that allows any user to select a user and a role, requests the approvals needed <em>and</em> adds the role to the user record when the approvals are received?</p>

<p>You share your idea with your development team, and they love it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#34;Great idea - a catalog item processed with a Flow Designer spoke! Be sure to build an automated test at the same time, so we can verify it still works after upgrades, K?&#34; </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#34;Whoa, whoa, whoa,&#34; you say. &#34;I&#39;m not a programmer - I was just bringing the idea to you guys!&#34;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#34;You don&#39;t need to know code. You can do this.&#34; </p>
<p>Ushered out with a pat on the back, you realize you&#39;re on your own. </p>
<p><em>Flow Designer spoke? Automated test? Yikes - you might have gotten yourself in too deep! </em></p>
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>No worries - we&#39;ve got you covered!</p>
<p>In this installment of our <a title="NOWSupport best practices series list" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;6e7d6269dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NOWSupport best practices series list</a>, we provide a quick primer on Flow Designer spokes and automated tests on the Now Platform®, and in our video below, we show you how to build a Flow Designer spoke concurrently with an automated test.</p>
<h3>What is a Flow Designer spoke?</h3>
<p>A spoke is a scoped application containing <span class="ph">Flow Designer</span> content dedicated to a particular application or record type. <span class="ph">Flow Designer</span> provides a set of core actions to automate Now Platform® processes. You can add application-specific core actions by activating the associated spoke. Here&#39;s a list of some of the available Flow Designer spokes, or you can build your own:</p>
<ul><li><a title="Benchmarks spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/reference/benchmarks-actions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Benchmarks spoke</a></li><li><a title="Connect spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/reference/connect-spoke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Connect spoke</a></li><li><a title="Customer Service spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/reference/customer-service-actions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Customer Service spoke</a></li><li><a title="Field Service spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/reference/field-service-actions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Field Service spoke</a></li><li><a title="ITSM spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/reference/itsm-spoke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ITSM spoke</a></li><li><a title="Security Operations spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/secops-spoke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Security Operations spoke</a></li><li><a title="Visual Task Board (VTB) spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/reference/vtb-actions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Visual Task Board (VTB) spoke</a></li></ul>
<p>With a subscription to <a title="Integration Hub" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/concept/integrationhub.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IntegrationHub</a>, you can also integrate with external instances and third-party applications. Here are just a few of the spokes available:</p>
<ul><li><a title="HipChat spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/hipchat-spoke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">HipChat spoke</a></li><li><a title="Microsoft Teams spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/microsoft-teams-spoke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Teams spoke</a></li><li><a title="ServiceNow eBonding spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/ebonding-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow eBonding spoke</a></li><li><a title="Slack spoke" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/concept/slack-spoke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Slack spoke</a></li></ul>
<p> Spokes appear in the Flow Designer within the action selector:</p>

<h3>What is an automated test?</h3>
<p>An automated test is a custom test that you build in the <a title="Automated Test Framework" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-application-development/page/administer/auto-test-framework/concept/automated-test-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Automated Test Framework</a> (ATF) to validate functionality prior to production deployments. You can run automated tests to confirm your instance works after making a change such as after an upgrade, during application development, or when deploying instance configurations with update sets. </p>
<p>Automated tests provide an alternative to manual testing, and eliminate human error from the testing process.</p>
<p>When you build your automated tests, be sure to follow the recommendations in our post <a title="Best Practices for using ATF" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;1a4e66addbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96192f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Best Practices for using ATF</a>.</p>
<h3>How do I build a Flow Designer Spoke with an automated test?</h3>
