<p>Patching is an overwhelming and painful process. It involves a joint effort between security and IT, but it’s hard to prioritize and track work between these teams. It can also be hard to know which solution is the right one to deploy.</p>
<p>With ServiceNow’s New York Release, we’re excited to announce several new features that can help our customers address cyber exposure and optimize response processes to ensure timely discovery, prioritization and remediation of security weaknesses.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Vulnerability Solution Management</strong>  </h4>
<p>Vulnerability Solution Management correlates your vulnerability exposure with solutions to show the most impactful remediation activities for your organization and monitor their completion. It offers the following capabilities: </p>
<ul><li>Provides automated correlation of Microsoft solutions with vulnerabilities, identifies the top solutions by their risk reduction, and indicates which solutions to use </li><li>Offers support for 2,600 solutions across 2,000 vulnerabilities and 600 products </li><li>Tracks deployment progress against due dates that are tied to vulnerability remediation targets (SLAs) </li><li>Provides reporting metrics to Vulnerability Response dashboards to easily view progress </li></ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4><strong>Enhanced Risk Calculation Framework</strong>: </h4>
<p>As part of our risk scoring feature, we’ve introduced an enhanced risk calculation framework in our New York release, which incorporates vulnerability, threat, and asset parameters for improved risk assessments. Additionally, these enhancements also include a built-in simulator to visualize risk score distributions and fine-tune calculator configuration. </p>
<p>There are several values that this expanded framework takes into account to calculate risk scoring: </p>
<ul><li>Vulnerability severity </li><li>External vs. Internal CI exposure </li><li>Business service criticality </li><li>Exploit availability </li><li>Exploit skill level </li><li>Exploit attack vector</li></ul>
<p>Factoring in the availability and nature of an exploit has emerged as a crucial way to prioritize patching and communicate urgency to IT partners responsible for implementing a solution.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong> </h4>
<p>Vulnerability assessment and patching processes are traditionally siloed functions in the vulnerability response process. With the New York release, we help customers bridge the gap between these components of the vulnerability process to ensure impactful remediation and insightful risk assessment.  </p>
