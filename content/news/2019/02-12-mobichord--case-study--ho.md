<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VITAS Healthcare</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the leading provider of hospice care in the United States. They operate 47 programs in more than 14 states and employ over 12,000 people. VITAS is a subsidiary of publicly traded Chemed Corporation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Management Difficulties</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many companies, VITAS’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobility</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program was a combination of carrier portals, an MDM solution, an ERP system, and excel spreadsheets. Making simple changes for users was slow and cumbersome. Having so many users and manual systems, simple tasks like allocating expenses to cost centers and asset inventory reports took days to complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond these issues of slow and manual work, VITAS faced three main issues in their mobility program.</span></p>
<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lack of Device Lifecycle Management</span></li></ol>
<ul><li>Where are these devices?</li><li>Who are they assigned to?</li></ul>
<ol start="2"><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Healthcare’s High Turnover Rates</span></li></ol>
<ul><li>New Hires</li><li>Transfers</li></ul>
<ol start="3"><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Uncontrolled Expense Management</span></li></ol>
<ul><li>10k-page monthly carrier invoices</li><li>Understanding and controlling usage</li></ul>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integration was key to finding the right solution for VITAS. “We couldn’t pass on the opportunity to integrate seamlessly with our MDM, carrier portals and ServiceNow,” says Naresh Samlal, AVP, IT support at VITAS. “That was right out of the box for MobiChord.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mobichord.com/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MobiChord</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was up and running on VITAS’ ServiceNow instance in a matter of days. Now VITAS has access to carrier portals, MDM solution, ERP system, and invoice data all in ServiceNow. Other HUGE benefits VITAS is receiving from MobiChord include:</span></p>
<p><strong>Huge Time Savings</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Now that VITAS have all their systems aggregated on </span><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ServiceNow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are no longer swivelchairing between multiple systems. Everything is now accessible from one portal.</span></p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Visibility –</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having enhanced visibility allowed VITAS to gain additional insights into plans, features, lines, users, pools, and charges. This led VITAS to realize 25% on carrier-cost reductions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Making Mobility a Cornerstone</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Moving away from simply tracking devices, to using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobility</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a strategy to enhance patient and employee experience changed the way VITAS runs their company.</span></p>
