We&#39;re looking forward to conversations about automating and accelerating change while allowing developers to stay within their existing tools. We&#39;ll also be showing the work we are doing around driving new end-to-end insights into the whole development-to-release pipeline from ideation all the way through to operations - plus the audit insights that the data from the DevOps toolchain can provide.Â </p>
