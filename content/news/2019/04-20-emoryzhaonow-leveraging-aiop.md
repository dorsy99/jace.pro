<p><em>Steve Anderson from ITOM Product Management gives you a peek at his upcoming Knowledge breakout</em></p>
<p>Digital transformation is putting IT operations on the front lines of business innovation. We’re seeing an explosion in applications and business services as enterprises look to enhance the customer experience, gain new business insights, increase productivity, and create sustainable competitive advantage. Charged with keeping these systems up and running, IT operations is now a mission-critical business function.</p>
<p>If you’re involved in IT operations, you know that maintaining high service availability is a huge challenge. It’s not just the rapidly increasing number of applications and services. As IT moves away from static, monolithic infrastructures to dynamic environments and continuous delivery models, this creates enormous complexity, with diverse resource types, public and private clouds, and exploding connectivity.</p>
<p><br />I’ll be talking at Knowledge about how AIOps can help you to tackle this increasing complexity and scale, improving the availability of current and next-generation services. AIOps works hand in hand with your IT operations team, giving them the tools and insights they need to rise to the challenges of digital transformation. At the session, I’ll be covering key components of an AIOps approach, including:</p>
<p><br />• Centralized ingestion of events and metrics<br />• Automated alert correlation based on spatial and temporal patterns<br />• Anomaly detection<br />• Service topology noise reduction<br />• Service-centric alert prioritization<br />• Root cause analysis<br />• Automated remediation</p>
<p><br />I’m excited about this session – and I hope you are as well. To sign up, look for BRE1417 on the session calendar. See you in Las Vegas!</p>
