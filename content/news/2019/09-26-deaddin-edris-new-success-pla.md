<h3> Step 2: Design the service</h3>
<p>Developing the correct approach to service adoption across the enterprise is critical to achieve success. Breaking the adoption into phases when approaching the implementation of the service will help you achieve early success stories in order to support the expansion throughout the organization. During this process, consider the existing onboarding activities already in place and determine commonalities between departments to reduce overlap. Following these best practices can help achieve a repeatable, scalable expansion.</p>
<h3> Step 3: Develop a plan for service adoption</h3>
<p>After defining your objectives and developing a strategy, you can begin creating an adoption plan. Testing, training, and communication considerations are important to define when driving change and new service adoption among your employees. Involving process owners and acknowledging user feedback is valuable when monitoring the implementation of your service. It is important for your employees to understand how the new service not only impacts the company, but also how it directly benefits them. </p>
<h3> Step 4: Scale and extend across the enterprise</h3>
<p>Analyzing the level of success of your initial phase will help you prioritize which alterations and improvements to make before expanding. Develop value in your onboarding service by highlighting the successes of the initial phase and using success stories to drive excitement across the larger organization for when you begin the full rollout. This playbook will help you develop a successful plan when expanding your service through the system lifecycle.</p>
