<p class="ng-scope">Note: <em>Do not publish/demo/promote in any way your Orlando instance to anyone who has not agreed to our program&#39;s legal terms and conditions (completed when joining the TPP). </em></p>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Why do we provide early access to technology partners?</strong></p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>In order for partners to test their apps against the Orlando release and address any bugs or changes by the time Orlando goes GA and their customers start to upgrade.</li><li>In order for partners to assess new features in Orlando, and determine which should be incorporated into their store apps.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Early Access Expectations</strong></p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>Partners are expected to use early access to test their apps against the Orlando release.</li><li>Partners are expected to submit their application for certification or recertification on the Orlando release once Orlando certification opens. *Failure to submit for Orlando certification may disqualify you from future early access.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Eligibility<br /></strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">In order to qualify for Orlando early access you must:</p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>Be a current Technology Partner.</li><li>Have an app currently certified on New York.</li><li>Be requesting an upgrade to a single vendor instance.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>How should partners be testing their apps in the Orlando release?</strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">You should be testing for both applications already in instances when they&#39;re upgraded and then installing the app onto a clean instance.</p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>Request early access for a vendor instance which already has your app installed on it.</li><li>In the newly upgraded Orlando instance run through your application test cases.</li><li>Request a zboot (instance reset) of that instance on hi.</li><li>Install your app onto the newly zbooted, clean Orlando instance and run through your functional test cases.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><em>Going through this process will test your app for both customers who are upgrading to Orlando and customers who are installing it for the first time onto Orlando.</em></p>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>How do you request Early Access?</strong></p>
