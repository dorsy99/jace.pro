<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">When New York release is around the corner, it’s that time of year again for us to learn about the new features, enhancements, and APIs that may be applicable to someone developing an application to list on the store or OEM. I&#39;m very excited and want to share with you about the followings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Last week we opened up Early Access for Technology Partners to get their hands on New York, running it through its paces and preparing to submit their apps for certification</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">In this post, we&#39;ll provide an overview of all the significant features and improvements that Technology Partners will want to be aware of, whether you are building apps for the ServiceNow Store or OEM. The TPP technical team is also working on doing deep dives into many of these areas, so stay tuned.</span></p>

<h3 class="ng-scope"><strong>New Features and Major Enhancements</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/administer/natural-language-intelligence/concept/natural-language-intelligence.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Natural Language Understanding<br /></strong></a> Provides an NLU model builder and an NLU inference service that you can use to enable the system to learn and respond to human-expressed intent. By entering natural language examples into the system, you help it understand word meanings and contexts so it can infer user or system actions. For example, Virtual Agent administrators can configure a Virtual Agent Designer conversation flow to consume NLU models so that agent chatbots can better understand user statements in the conversation</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/now-platform-administration/dynamic-translation-rn.html" rel="nofollow">Dynamic Translation<br /></a> </strong>For a seamless localization experience, you can use translation service providers and enable the translation of a dynamically generated text, such as user-entered text on various forms</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/now-platform-capabilities/instance-data-replication-rn.html" rel="nofollow">Instance Data Replication<br /></a> </strong>Instance Data Replication copies data updates made on one instance, called the producer, to one or more other instances, called consumers. Data from a producer instance can be replicated into tables of the same name on consumer instances or into entirely different tables. The data can be replicated as is or you can modify the data during replication. IDR does not replicate metadata or many user tables, so do not use it to clone instances.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/mobile/now-mobile-platform-rn.html" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Mobile<br /></a> </strong>The mobile platform is updated to use the new mobile hierarchy, which includes new features such as application launchers and a configurable navigation bar. ServiceNow Mobile is built from the ground up to make building apps that are mobile ready faster. If you have an existing mobile capability or think your app will benefit from one then you should look at how ServiceNow Mobile could accelerate your rollout.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/application-development/automated-test-framework-rn.html" rel="nofollow">Automated Testing Framework<br /></a> </strong>The ATF received a lot of attention in the New York release with enhancements like</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Test an attachment-dependent business rule by uploading an attachment either from a form or from a server-side API call</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Reduce testing time by running multiple tests and test suites in parallel</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Prevent conflicting tests from running in parallel by marking them as mutually exclusive</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">.... and much more!</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">If you haven&#39;t yet included ATF tests in your application you should strongly consider it as it will assist your customers in testing your app through their upgrade cycles. It should also form a part of your internal app testing.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/now-platform-capabilities/flow-designer-rn.html" rel="nofollow">Flow Designer</a> / <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/now-platform-capabilities/integrationhub-rn.html" rel="nofollow">Integration Hub<br /></a> </strong>Flow Designer continues to grow in capability and Madrid sees many new capabilities including:</p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">IntegrationHub too has added capabilities with the addition of:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Data stream actions and pagination</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">JDBC step</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Retry policies</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">SSH step</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">XML parser step</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">OpenAPI support</span></li></ul>

<h3 class="ng-scope"><strong>Scripting and App Dev Enhancements</strong></h3>

You can view external data in lists or forms and process it with standard Glide scripts.</li><li><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-application-development/page/script/general-scripting/concept/c_SyntaxEditor.html#context-menu-syntax-editor" rel="nofollow">Context Menu</a> - </strong>Context menu is an exciting new platform capability that allows users to navigate to Script include definitions, Glide API documentation, and custom table definition and data.</li><li><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/application-administration.html" rel="nofollow">Application administration</a> - </strong>You can set a property to require that more than one user must have the application-specific admin role for a scoped application. Assigning the application-specific admin role to multiple users reduces the risk of getting locked out of the scoped application.</li><li><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/application-development/delegated-development-deployment-rn.html" rel="nofollow">Delegated development and deployment</a> - </strong>Delegate non-administrators to use update sets to deploy applications to other instances.</li><li><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-application-development/page/build/guided-app-creator/concept/guided-app-creator.html" rel="nofollow">Guided Application Creator</a> - </strong>Guided Application Creator is the new way to set up applications on the Now Platform.
