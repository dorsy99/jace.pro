<p><strong>Deloitte – POWS1812 - Flow of Work: Exceptional Human Experience with ServiceNow</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday, May 7, 3:30 pm - 4:20 pm</p>
<p>Workers are seeking experiences as easy as a smart phone, connection with each other, meaning and purpose at work, and information with integrity, transparency and insight. They want enjoyment, while working hard with effort and intent. Leaders are seeking streamlined processes, simplified technology platforms and value from investments. This session will explore how Deloitte and their clients are achieving both objectives with a new way of looking at flow of work.</p>
<p><strong>Accenture – POWS1796 - CIO Live: IT as a business advisor now and in the post-digital era</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday, May 8, 10:45 am - 11:35 am</p>
<p>Digital transformation grants companies exceptional capabilities— but it also creates enormous expectations that businesses need to meet. IT leaders have an opportunity to play a role in guiding the business through innovation and transformation, to find a balance between tactical, near term, and long-term goals with the “Art of the Possible.” Accenture’s CIO Andrew Wilson and senior leaders from our top clients will talk through their own transformation stories and how they’ve engaged other business leaders to lead the enterprise through digital disruption. We’ll also dive into some emerging technology trends that IT can use to help their businesses differentiate in the post-digital future.</p>
<p><strong>DXC Technology – POWS1851 - ServiceNow at scale: Broad business, big benefits</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday, May 8<strong>, </strong>2:30 pm - 3:20 pm</p>
<p>ServiceNow has off-the-charts potential, but the value of the platform is only as big as your ability to execute. Join DXC Consulting Leaders and a few of our more ambitious customers to learn how they “walk the walk,” by driving the value of ServiceNow across geographies, business units, and integrated systems. Athleticwear rocketship, Under Armour, maximizes ROI for technology rollouts by accelerating user acceptance. European energy innovator, Uniper, provides “digital transparency” to delight business stakeholders in 40 countries. After a three hour go-live of one of the largest ServiceNow data migrations ever, Deutsche Bank now channels 7 terabytes of vital data across 160 applications throughout the bank—with zero impact on any data consumers. And Dutch insurance giant, Vivat, deploys ServiceNow to manage all four value streams of the flourishing IT4IT framework.
