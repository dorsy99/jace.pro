<p>You may have noticed recently that we made a change to how individuals authenticate to HI, ServiceNow’s customer service portal. By adding Multifactor Authentication (MFA) to HI user accounts we are enhancing security for our customers. This change is happening in a phased approach that started with all ServiceNow employees and pilot customers and is now rolling out to every customer account over the next couple months.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to sit down with <em><strong>Chris Peake, Global Sr. Director, Trust and Security Services at ServiceNow</strong></em> to understand more about Multifactor Authentication and the reasons why we are implementing this additional level of security on HI. Below is our conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Chris, what is Multifactor Authentication (MFA)?</strong><br />MFA is a way to help ensure that the person trying to log into a system is who they say they are and is authorized to do so. With respect to HI, it will be accomplished by going beyond the user name and password and asking our users for an additional 6-digit verification code. Only after they have told us who they are and entered in the correct verification code will they be logged into the HI Service Portal.</p>
<p><strong>Why was this done?</strong> <br />We added Multifactor Authentication (MFA) to HI user accounts to enhance security. Bottom line, while we know that MFA adds additional steps to the login process, this is necessary to protect HI user accounts and our service against password-based attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Are our customer accounts really at risk?</strong><br />The reality is that password spray and credential stuffing attacks are so rampant across systems that wide-spread warnings have been released by USCERT and other response organizations informing service providers and users of the threat. MFA effectively eliminates the threat of stolen or compromised credentials being used by unauthorized entities.</p>
<p><strong>Which Multi-Factor Authenticators are supported by HI Service Portal?</strong><br />There are quite a few of them. <a title="More Information" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0749491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">This article </a>provides an updated list of supported authenticators supported by the HI Service Portal team.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find more information about MFA?</strong> <br />This <a title="MFA KB Article" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0656473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">KB</a> outlines some key details with respect to MFA. There is a helpful FAQ at the bottom of the KB that addresses questions like what if I don’t have a smart phone or what if I need to pair a new device.</p>
<p><strong>Any final words or thoughts?</strong> <br />While we always strive to make our service as user-friendly as possible, we are also committed to the highest security standards. So we hope that you will understand that we are making this change with our customers best interests in mind. Making the world of work, work better for people requires that we have protected users and a secure service.
