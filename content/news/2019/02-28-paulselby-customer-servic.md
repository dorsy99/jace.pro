<p>Knowledge management is a critical aspect of delivering customer service. It can increase customer satisfaction while reducing the cost of service, through use by both customers and agents, as well as serving as solutions offered up by new technologies like <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/virtual-agent.html" rel="nofollow">chatbots</a>. </p>
<p>So why doesn’t every organization use or it or why do the struggle to succeed in their knowledge strategy? Often, it’s because they lack the best practices necessary to efficiently create, improve, and curate knowledge. This limits knowledge’s effectiveness and can cause knowledge practices to stall or terminate. The good news is we have the answer.</p>
<h1>A standardized approach</h1>
<p>ServiceNow has long been a supporter of knowledge management. The <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;96af6253dbb3db00b2102926ca96190b" rel="nofollow">London release</a> of Customer Service Management included several enhancements to its Knowledge Management application. These followed additions in the <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;726c6ea1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619d6" rel="nofollow">Kingston</a>,<a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;26dde6e9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619e0" rel="nofollow">Jakarta</a>, and earlier releases.</p>
<p>While the features are important, it’s the fact that they support the <a href="http://www.serviceinnovation.org/" rel="nofollow">Consortium for Service Innovation’s</a>™ <a href="https://www.thekcsacademy.net/kcs/" rel="nofollow">Knowledge-Centered Service</a><sup>1</sup> (KCS) methodology–an approach that has been developed over many years that can help ensure the success of knowledge in an organization. Customer Service Management goes beyond just supporting KCS, though. As of the London release, is is the first v6 verified tool in the “Combined Knowledge Management and Incident Management Products” category. This means the latest concepts in KCS are supported directly within Customer Service Management, making it easy to adopt and maintain a knowledge strategy.</p>
