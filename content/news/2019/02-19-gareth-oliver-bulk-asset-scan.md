<p>A customer recently ask - &#34;how can ServiceNow support a bulk asset scan? Imagine that I&#39;m a field tech, and I&#39;ve been asked to scan all devices at a location. How can ServiceNow help?&#34;</p>
<p>One of my colleagues put together this proof of concept using the Madrid mobile app &gt;&gt;Â <a href="https://youtu.be/896Lx0giDWY" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/896Lx0giDWY</a>. The use case is to scan multiple assets, then to be able to set a single location or a status, and possibly even link it to a change request.</p>
<p>Source code for the mobile app and QR code generator are included in the YouTube notes.</p>
<p>NOTE that is is an example app, is not a ServiceNow-provided app - you use it, you own it.</p>
