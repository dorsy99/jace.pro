<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Although unknown to many, the capability exists within SeviceNow to create a report based directly on data from an external spreadsheet file -- for example such as a spreadsheet created in the Microsoft Excel application.  This blog post will describe the steps to create a report based on data from an excel spreadsheet, with a simple example.  Much of this information is also covered, but in more detail in Knowledge Base Article<a href="http://bit.ly/KB0722420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> KB0722420 - How to create a report based on data from an external Excel spreadsheet.</a></span></p>
<h1>Creating a report using an external excel file</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">For this example we intend to create a report in ServiceNow that displays the counts of new clients for a furniture company based on the state the client is found in (geographical state).  Perhaps also this data has already been captured and stored in a spreadsheet file used by the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">The goal is to convert that data to an informative graphical based report in the companies ServiceNow instance.</span></p>
<h2>Step 1: Format the Data Source (Spreadsheet)</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">The first action to take is to review (or create0 the spreadsheet file which will be used as the source data for the ServiceNow report.  For spreadsheets that are intended to be directly imported for report data, the spreadsheet data should be in a straightforward format. </span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">The spreadsheet should be a series of rows of data, with each row representing perhaps one record in a &#34;table&#34; of related data.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">The top row of the spreadsheet should contain the column labels representing the data in the associated row. </span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">For our example, we have the following simple spreadsheet data which we intend to use as the source for such a report.</span></p>
<p><img src="66d99835db3a6f402e8c2183ca961943.iix" width="598" height="215" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Note that much more complex types of spreadsheets and data sources can be used for import into ServiceNow, but those will generally require the use of data mappings and import sets.  See the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-administration/page/administer/import-sets/concept/c_ImportDataUsingImportSets.html" rel="nofollow">Docs site Data Import Landing Page</a> for more information regarding various methods to import more complex dataset into a ServiceNow instance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">For our example in this posting, however, the requirement is to make a quick report based on an existing spreadsheet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Once a properly formatted spreadsheet is found, the next step is to perform the actual import into the instance.</span></p>
<h2>Step 2: Import the Data into the Instance</h2>
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">To begin this Step, login to the ServiceNow instance with an account having the necessary permissions to create new reports in the reporting system (i.e. admin or report_admin). </span></li><li>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Note also that in order for the necessary options to appear which will allow direct spreadsheet data import for a report, the Performance Analytics - Premium plugin must be installed on the instance.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Once logged in, browse to the location <strong>Reporting &gt; Create New.</strong> </span></li><li>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Ensure you are using the new Report Designer interface as the direct spreadsheet import functionality is not available in the Classic UI.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Give the report a descriptive name in the Report Name field. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">From the Source type pulldown menu, select External import. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">After selecting External import, click the Upload a file icon to the right of the External import field.</span></li></ol>
<center>
<p><img src="ba4f94f9db7a6f402e8c2183ca9619c1.iix" width="398" height="405" /></p>
</center>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">The<strong> Upload</strong> external source window will appear.  The source data spreadsheet file can be dragged directly into the dragzone of the form, or alternatively, the Browse files button can be used to open a file browser to select the spreadsheet file. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;"><em>Note that only files of .xlsx format and ending in a .xlsx extension can be selected and used as the data source. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">After selecting the source spreadsheet file, the <strong>Edit</strong> external import window will appear.  A name should be provided for the external data source and an Expiration option selected.  The expiration option will be the selected time from the day on which the record is saved.  After the expiration time is exceeded, the data source will be marked as expired and the reports will be deleted from the system.  The expiration times can be selected from 1 week to 1 year. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;"><em>Note that the data for an imported spreadsheet is static, so it will not automatically update if the data in the external spreadsheet is changed. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Lastly, the permissions for the external data source are set in the <strong>Visible</strong> to section.  Ensure any users who should be able to review the completed report also has permissions to the data source.</span></p>
<center><img src="325d603ddb3e6f402e8c2183ca961964.iix" width="557" height="382" /></center>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">After selecting all the options as needed, clicking the <strong>Upload</strong> button will load the external file and save the record. If any errors are returned, review the source file and ensure it follows the basic format recognized by the basic import engine.  The import log can also be viewed to help resolve any issues that may have prevented the spreadsheet from importing properly.  See the Doc site article <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-administration/page/administer/time/reference/import-logs-2.html" rel="nofollow">Import Log </a>for more information on these logs and how they might be accessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">If the system was able to load the file successfully, a message will appear indicating the Import was successful.  Click the <strong>Done</strong> button to close the import dialog window and return to the report record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Step 3: Configure the Report</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">After the spreadsheet data source has been imported into the system, the last step is to complete configuration of the final report.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Group By</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">The Group by field will usually, by default, be set to the first column name it finds, thus you will probably want to modify this to group by the specific column you want to consider; in this example we will select the Company Location column.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Aggregation</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">It will also need to be determined what type aggregation should be used for the report (sum, average, count, etc).  For this example, the default setting of Count is what we want.  We will also leave the other option on the Configure tab to the default setting which should be adequate for our example.</span></p>

</center>
<p>If we want to modify any of the visual elements of the report, we can do this from the <strong>Style</strong> tab on the report designer interface.  This includes settings for the color palette used, x and y axis labeling, legend display, etc.</p>
<p>Anytime during the process we can click the <strong>Run</strong> button to reload the current report without saving the report.</p>
<p>Once fully satisfied with the report, we can click the <strong>Save</strong> button which will Save the report and reload it.</p>
