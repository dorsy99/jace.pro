<p><em>Welcome to Episode 2 of our DevOps Podcast Series!</em></p>
<p><em>Today, we have Chris Pope (aka The Pope), VP of Innovation at ServiceNow, with us to discuss all things DevOps and Agile. He gives us a brief history of the platform evolution and some of the amazing things we are doing to “make the world of work, work better for people.” He also discusses a concept of “Tragic Agile - #tragile” which is what he has seen when customers are not successful in implementing their agile strategies.  </em></p>
