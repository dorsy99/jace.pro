<p>The Platform and ISV teams are launching a new partnership with <a href="https://www.g2.com/" rel="nofollow">G2</a> to drive scads more customer reviews for ISV partner apps in the <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Store.</a>  Product reviews are the #1 type of content that  B2B tech buyers look for in their buying journey according to Forrester so this is all about providing that info to ServiceNow Store shoppers - our customers -  and converting visitors to leads for our ISV partners.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>To launch the partnership, we&#39;ll have an App Review booth at Knowledge in the CreatorCon area on the show floor and we&#39;re working with ISV partner sponsors in Expo Now to refer their customers to the booth to write a review. Once the review is validated, reviewers get a $10 Amazon Gift Card and ServiceNow will donate $10 to <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" rel="nofollow">Girls Who Code.</a></p>
<p>G2 has created a custom review experience for Knowledge to make it super easy for customers to review apps.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a Store partner please ask your customers to visit the G2 App Review booth in the CreatorCon area on the show floor to review your app. If you&#39;re an AE or SC with customers who use Store apps, please do the same! See you at Knowledge! </p>
