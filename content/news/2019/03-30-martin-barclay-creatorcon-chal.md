<p style="text-align: left;">The short list is in! Congratulations to the 2019 <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/company/ventures/creatorcon-challenge.html" rel="nofollow">CreatorCon Challenge</a> final six. These developers, entrepreneurs, and startup founders represent the pinnacle of ISV app innovation on the world&#39;s most innovative platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They have risen to the top of hundreds of entries with break through apps they have created on the Now Platform, and will be live in person in the CreatorCon Challenge Pod in the centrally located CreatorCon area on the Knowledge 2019 show floor to showcase their apps to the twenty thousand attendees so come meet and congratulate them and see what they&#39;ve created!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All are in the running to be selected as one of the three finalists who will pitch shark tank style in the <a href="https://www.servicenowevents.com/knowledge2019/public_session_view.php?session_id&#61;1176&amp;agenda_session_id&#61;1347" rel="nofollow">CreatorCon Challenge Keynote </a>in the Venetian Ballroom to the esteemed judging panel led by Fred Luddy and VC luminaries BJ Lackland (Lighter Capital), Om Malik (True Ventures), and Glenn Solomon (GGV Capital) and compete for a $250K investment from ServiceNow Ventures and then go on to fame and fortune with sales enablement and marketing support from ServiceNow and selling apps on the <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Store</a> to ServiceNow customers and new accounts in new markets globally.
