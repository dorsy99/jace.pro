<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-it-service-management/page/product/continual-improvement-management/concept/cim-landing-page.html" rel="nofollow">Continual Improvement Management</a> is a new App released in London. In this post I am addressing some FAQs about the CIM app, process, best practices and how you can get started.</span></p>
<p class="p3">  </p>
<h3 class="p3">What is Continual Improvement Management (CIM)?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Continual Service Improvement is a key process in ITIL and other improvement frameworks; but IT Organizations today do not have a solution that can easily manage the end-to-end process of Continual Service Improvement. </span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="d7264852db472780afc902d5ca96198a.iix" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are solving this problem with the purpose-built ServiceNow Continual Improvement Management app. The CIM app makes it possible to drive new levels of service efficiency by automating the process of continually delivering service improvements across the enterprise. Take continual improvement from theory to reality with a structured framework that aligns people, process, and data in one place to achieve service excellence in any process.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Use the CIM app to receive improvement ideas from any application or employee. Use the context‑rich workbench to prioritize and rank initiatives. Service owners can configure KPIs and dashboards to measure effort, outcome, time‑to‑completion, and milestones in relation to overall business goals and show the outcome achieved.</span></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<h3 class="p3">How can I get the CIM app on my Instance?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In London, the CIM app is available as part of ITSM Professional SKU. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ITSM Pro SKU comes with following capabilities: Continual Improvement Management App, Performance Analytics Premium, Virtual Agent, Agent Intelligence.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You can try out CIM in your non-prod instance any time before subscribing to premium SKU for your production Instance.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you are not an ITSM customer, reach out to your ServiceNow Account Rep for options.</span></li></ul>
<h3 class="p1"> </h3>
<h3 class="p1">What makes ServiceNow CIM different from other CSI offerings?</h3>
<ul><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Structured Approach</strong> – A light weight framework to manage continual improvement from identifying improvements to value realization.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Proactive -</strong> Assess your process or service performance proactively and make improvements before people start complaining.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Simplified Management </strong>– Continual Improvement Workbench provides simplified access for managers.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Value Realization</strong> – dashboards provide visibility into the business outcomes achieved through Continual Improvement.</span></li></ul>
<h3 class="p3"> </h3>
<h3 class="p3">What are the benefits of using the CIM app?</h3>
<ul><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Easily find Improvement Opportunity</strong>: Data driven insights and integration with Performance Analytics, Survey &amp; Assessments, Benchmarks, Post Incident Review, and the Coaching module to make it easy to find bottlenecks and Improvement Opportunities.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Strategic Alignment:</strong> Align all improvement Initiatives with Company or BU Strategic goals.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Set SMART Goal:</strong> Set KPI based measurable goals.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Show outcomes achieved:</strong> Out of the Box Value Realization Dashboard to show outcomes achieved.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Foster Improvement Culture:</strong> Help Engage more people for greater Impact.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Help make IT run Lean</strong>: Remove process gaps and reduce productivity waste.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Innovation:</strong> Drive business Innovation and competitive advantage by regular and frequent improvement.</span></li></ul>
<h3 class="p3"> </h3>
<h3 class="p3">I am already using Demand/Project (PPM), why do I need CIM?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The CIM app provides a lightweight, structured approach with metric based insights needed to run a successful Continual Improvement program. It brings data, KPI based goal setting &amp; monitoring, continuous feedback capabilities, and business objective to one place so that you can make step-by-step improvement to getting better all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">CIM helps combine the power of the ServiceNow platform and many other applications, and makes it possible to easily capture improvement opportunities from various Service/Process/Teams, plan and implement all prioritized item in an efficient manner and show the value achieved through CIM program to the decision makers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Continual Improvement is not like a typical project which always has a start and end date - CIM should be continual process. You collect improvement opportunities into an Improvement register. Improvement initiatives go through a plan, do, check, act (PDCA) like process flow. At the end of the continual improvement PDCA cycle, the implemented measures should be reinforced by standards that make the improvement permanent (avoid rollbacks). </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"> </h3>
<h3 class="p3">What are the benefits of using CIM and Demand/Project together?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As the CIM app has no hard dependency on ITBM apps,  it can be used independently. But to get the best of both worlds, we have provided out of the box integration points that will show up automatically when both the CIM app and ITBM app plugins are installed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The OOTB integration makes it really easy to use capabilities from both sides together as and when required. For example, with one click you can convert a Demand Record into a Continual Improvement Register record. Similarly, you can convert a CIM task into a Story if your implementation team is working in an Agile framework.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="td1" valign="top">
<p class="p3"><strong>Demand to CIM:</strong> Demand Manager would like to Implement a Demand using the CIM app instead of converting it to a full-fledge Project</p>
</td><td class="td1" valign="top">
<p class="p3">CIM Provides a simple PDCA based framework that helps you in identifying and understanding the problem, comes up with list of tasks that need to be done, set SMART goals using KPI a based data driven approach and show the value achieved using out of the box report and Dashboards.</p>

<p class="p3"><strong>CIM to Demand:</strong> Improvement manager has one Improvement Initiative that required a Business Case and Approval Process</p>
</td><td class="td1" valign="top">
<p class="p3">In scenarios, when an Improvement Initiative has a requirement of creating a detailed business case and approval then you can create a Demand record from CIM.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="td1" valign="top">
<p class="p3"><strong>CIM to Project: </strong>An improvement initiative is big enough and has requirements of resource planning, budget and investment planning. In this scenario, the Improvement manager can create a Project from an Improvement Initiative</p>
</td><td class="td1" valign="top">
<p class="p3">Provides a great better together use case where Continual Improvement related work can get done in the CIM app and Project related work can go to the Project module with visibility and accessibility from both sides.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="td1" valign="top">
<p class="p3"><strong>CIM to Story:</strong> Leverage Agile and Story execution by converting CIM tasks to stories</p>
</td><td class="td1" valign="top">
<p class="p3">This integration provides full flexibility and you can run your improvement in Agile model.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Continual Improvement practitioners use the CIM app for doing Service/Process review and identifying opportunities to get better all the time. If the work requires Demand management, Cost Management, Budget planning or Project level work break down structure planning then ServiceNow PPM (project and portfolio) has all the solutions.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3">What are the other out of the box integration areas in ITSM?</h3>
<p class="p3">See the picture below for OOTB Integration. The integration points (UI Action/Related List) will show up automatically when related plugins are activated. </p>
<p class="p1"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="616e73c2db832780afc902d5ca96197f.iix" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here are few examples of how different personas/teams can use OOTB integrations.</span></p>
<ul><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">IT Manager concerned with missed SLA growth trend submits an improvement request.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">IT manager compares KPI performance with Benchmarks, refers to Recommendations and submit an improvement request.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span class="Apple-converted-space">HR Manager looking at  </span>Voice of employee Survey,  scores are low, goes ahead and submit an improvement request.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Team doing Major Incident Post Review-submits an improvement request.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Manager doing Coaching Assessment for the team, submits an improvement request for process improvement or training needs.</span></li></ul>
<h3 class="p5"> </h3>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2">What are some best practices to get started?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><strong>1. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Who should use the CIM? </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The</span><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">CIM app provides three user roles:</span></p>
<ul><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Improvement Requester: Typically assigned to IT staff, service/process owners, Managers, Management Staff, Analyst, anybody who has data-based insights on how the service/process are working.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Improvement Manager: This person is the owner of the improvement program and helps foster the continual Improvement Culture in the organization.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Improvement Coordinators: Typically assigned to process/service owners. Improvement managers assign coordinators on Improvement initiatives based on the improvement area and subject matter expertise required to ensure successful delivery of improvement outcomes. </span></li></ul>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>2. What Qualifies for Continual Improvement?</strong></span></p>
<ul><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Continual Improvement is a step-by-step process to increase the effectiveness and/or efficiency of an organization to fulfil its goals/objectives</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An initiative that has long term impact on improving a Service/Process/Function.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An improvement request needs to go through the PDCA cycle.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At the end of CI PDCA cycle, the implemented measures should be reinforced by standards that make the improvement permanent (avoid rollbacks).</span></li></ul>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>3. I Installed the CIM app, how can I populate the Improvement register?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here are some ideas:</span></p>
<ul><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Review customer feedback and complaints. Carry out more assessments, ask customers to suggest improvement opportunities.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Look at process KPIs and any internal process assessments in PA and platform reports.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Compare with Benchmarks baseline and look for system suggested Benchmarks recommendations.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Review service reports for trends and issues that need to be addressed.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ask your process manager. Process Manager/Owner usually have great insight into what is not working well.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Review problem/change management trend reports</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Review Risk registers/GRC Audit test failures to see if there are any improvement opportunities there</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ask IT staff, development and project management staff for improvement suggestions. Provide CI requestor roles so that they can submit the improvement request to the CI register with one click.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Regular IT service management reviews, to identify what’s going well and what’s not.</span></li></ul>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>4. How Should I decide if something is Incident vs Problem vs Continual Improvement request?</strong></span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An issue or idea qualifies for a CIM record if it will contribute to an improved service or a process.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One good question to ask yourself before submitting an Improvement record is “Does this need to go through a PDCA process and will it have long term impact on Improving Service/Process/Function?”</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When in doubt, talk to your Improvement Manager to get training &amp; consensus on what qualifies for an Improvement Initiative.</span></li></ul>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>5. We do not have a formal approval team for CIM, so can I disable the approval state in the process?</strong><strong><br /></strong></span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By default, Approval is mandatory. But you can disable the approval process using a system property if you do not have a formal approval process in place. You will need the admin role for modifying this property.</span></li></ul>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> 6. What things can I start improving using CIM?</strong></span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Services:</strong> What users actually use: the reason they want IT. For example, Email Service</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Processes:</strong> The methods by which IT delivers service.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Products:</strong> Run Improvement Initiatives to enhance product experience and quality.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Enterprise Functions:</strong> ServiceNow’s unique CIM approach can be used to manage and drive improvements in any enterprise functions like IT, Customer Service, Product Success.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Individual Improvements:</strong> Provide continuous feedback loop and identify coaching opportunities.</span></li></ul>
