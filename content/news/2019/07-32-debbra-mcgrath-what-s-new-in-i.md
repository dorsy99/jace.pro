<h3>What&#39;s new in New York for ITBM?</h3>
<p>The New York release has arrived, with exciting new capabilities for ITBM! This includes new applications, enhanced support for Scaled Agile Framework, PPM mobile capabilities, and more – all created to enable enhanced employee engagement.  Here’s just some of what you’ll find in the New York release for ITBM:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(New) Innovation Management Application</h3>
<p>Innovation Management is a new application that allows users to submit ideas, vote on them, vet them and collaborate with others. It acts a single source of ideas in your organization to engage your employees so you can find that next big idea!</p>
<p>With ServiceNow® Innovation Management, you’ll view a vetted pipeline of ideas that can be easily filtered by state and category; convert vetted ideas to demands, projects, epics, stories and other task types; and keep users, reviewers and subscribers automatically informed as the idea progresses.</p>

<h3>(New) Investment Funding</h3>
<p>If you’re juggling spreadsheets to manage budgets and keep spending aligned with overall business strategy, you’ll love ITBM Investment Funding! Investment Funding provides a flexible funding approach for your investment dollars that enables you to fund any type of work, centralize investment planning, and separate work execution from funding with top-down budgeting. </p>
