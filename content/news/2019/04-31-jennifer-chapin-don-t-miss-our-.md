<p>It&#39;s almost time for <a href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/" rel="nofollow">Knowledge 2019 </a>and this year we are bringing you two great diversity, inclusion and belonging focused sessions! </p>
<p><strong>Alogorithmic bias: Can we stop bad data before it starts?</strong></p>
<p>DIBS1709</p>
<p>Although artificial intelligence and machine learning increasingly influence how digital products and systems work and the results they recommend, they’re only as good as the data that goes into them. Bad data leads to bias. Join this session to hear how industry experts and technologists are addressing bias in algorithms and the actions you can take to advance technology that is blind to bias.</p>
<p><strong>Next Generation Workforce: Get ready to rethink everything you thought you knew about the employee experience</strong></p>
<p>DIBS1710 </p>
<p>Tomorrow’s talent demands a different type of employee experience: Candidates want real connection, authenticity, and company culture, all before they even consider applying. Long term, they pursue organizations that have similar beliefs and goals, seek greater fulfillment and work-life balance, and offer an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Join Pat Wadors, ServiceNow CHRO, Tey Scott ServiceNow Global Head of Talent Acquisition and Seth Mattison, internationally renowned expert, author and futurist in a dynamic conversation that explores how to create an employee experience that the next generation will love.</p>
