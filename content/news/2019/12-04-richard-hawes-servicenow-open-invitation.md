<p>ServiceNow has partnered with the DevOps Institute to support their 2nd annual survey and resulting report. The survey and report are designed to help professionals better understand both the current and future state of DevOps skilling and cross-skilling across the global IT community.</p>
<p>The 2020 Upskilling Report will measure trends and progress of DevOps skillset development building upon the 1,600-plus survey responses from the 2019 benchmark report - we need input from anyone having any involvement in DevOps initiatives!</p>
<p>For every completed survey, the DevOps Institute will donate $1 to the global charity Teach for All to help under-served pockets of youth around the world. </p>
