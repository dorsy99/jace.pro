<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is a question we hear a lot.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #00ccff;">&#34;What tool should I use to collect, manage, track and show ROI on our continual improvement initiatives?</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Often this discussion goes down one of two paths. On the first path, what often follows is a laundry list of tools that often </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt;">includes Excel Sheets, Project Management Tools, Incident/Problems task type records and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the second path, typically an answer sounds like, “There is no single all-in-one tool for improvement management&#34;. Managers/Process owner deal with too many responsibility when it comes down to improvement related activities and a single tool can&#39;t encompass them all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The reason so many people continue to deal with multiple tools in silos is that there’s a huge assumption out there that no such tool exists. </span></p>
<h3>The cost of multiple tools:</h3>
<ol><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Not built for specific purpose and hard to create an efficient process that is lightweight and flexible.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Different team&#39;s in same org use different tools - totally unaware of how change in one process area might have a negative impact on other related processes.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What happens when one of the tools in your chain alter their functionality with new update? You have to sit down across your entire organization to come up with a new process to accommodate this change.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The actual cost of multiple tools and ongoing operation overhead. </span></li></ol>
