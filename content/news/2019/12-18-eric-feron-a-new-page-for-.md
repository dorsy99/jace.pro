<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>getting started with GRC is not straightforward and the path to success can sometimes appear a little elusive.</p>
<p>Since February of this year, we have started putting together a series of video tutorials aimed at guiding, step-by-step, the new members of the GRC community. We all want them / you to be very successful, fast.</p>
<p>Now that we have a strong (and still growing) program of (FREE) tutorials to help our friends get started, we have packaged them into a simple one-place-to-go.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce the launch of <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_forum&amp;sys_id&#61;c1ee25e6db0f730c0be6a345ca96195b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the new community area for new users of Policy &amp; Compliance</a>. If you are getting started with Policy &amp; Compliance, you simply cannot afford to not review ALL the tutorials available and follow the guidance and tips shared by our specialists.</p>
<p>And &#34;what about VRM&#34; you may ask? Fear not, the same format is on the way.</p>
<p>Enjoy and engage.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
<p>EF</p>
