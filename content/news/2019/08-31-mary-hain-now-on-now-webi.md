<p>High employee satisfaction is vital to ServiceNow’s success. In this webinar, ServiceNow IT leaders Mirza Baig and Rajeev Sethi will share how we use the ServiceNow Enterprise Service Management (ESM) to improve our employee experience and unlock productivity. They will share how they are increasing automation to boost overall efficiency by use of tools such as a virtual agent and built-in dashboards and analytics. ESM adoption has resulted in a 97% employee satisfaction rating and enabled our IT support team recoup up to 20% of their time.  We will also share our best practices for consolidating inefficient service delivery tools into a single, streamlined cloud workflow and the impact these changes have on the future of work at ServiceNow.  </p>
