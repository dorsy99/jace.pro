<p>ServiceNow DevOps has been released today.</p>
<p>Most large organizations are implementing DevOps best practices in an effort to boost responsiveness and innovation. Our customers have told us that they are being successful in individual development teams but have challenges seeing value from DevOps on a broader scale. One problem is a lack of oversight and another is fitting DevOps practices into a larger corporate delivery model. This release targets both those problems. Based around a sophisticated data model, ServiceNow DevOps connects to the leading development tools you are already using to gather information about the process. That can then be used for insights, for auditing, or for automating a change management process.</p>

<p>For this initial release we are targeting organizations in the Northeast USA and the UK with a broader rollout in 2020.  ServiceNow DevOps is a new product with its own licensing. Entitled customers will receive a link to download it from the ServiceNow Store and it can be applied to Madrid and New York platform versions.</p>
