<p><em><span style="font-family: symbol; font-size: 12pt;">I’m not a morning person, so any conversational-like activities usually begin after my 2nd coffee. Every morning when I stop at the local Café to get my coffee, the barista asks, ‘Good morning Adam, the usual?’ Adam is my International and local Starbucks name. I answer ‘yes’ with an awoken smile, and why not smile? I didn’t have to say much besides confirming my instant satisfaction of receiving a tall cappuccino with an extra shot. Also, she smiles back in acknowledgment of my tip. Mission accomplished.</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-family: symbol; font-size: 12pt;">People need to feel understood without having to answer to the usual onslaught of questions – How are you? What would you like? Where are you going? Empathy is an innate desire in all of us and something we expect in our day to day lives. Greeting someone by their name, modifying how you greet them depending on the time of day, location awareness, and personalization all constitute universal, low hanging fruit key to improving the conversational experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: symbol; font-size: 12pt;">Now let’s apply this concept of empathy as a pivotal enrichment to the customer experience. Your customers expect similar empathetic experiences regardless of whether this interaction is person to person or person to a chatbot. Let’s explore the example of an unexpected issue with a paycheck where interactions may have a heightened emotional charge. As you recently deployed a new global payroll solution, there has been an error in overtime pay calculation. As employees are reaching out for support at this critical moment, there is a prime opportunity to leverage conversational empathy delivered through the chatbot. Imagine if the chatbot initiated the conversation with a warm greeting using constructs like their preferred name, confirms your company is aware of the error and sets expectations for when you can expect to receive a pay correction. The chances of turning a polarizing conversation from a negative one to an affirmative experience complete with ‘this was helpful’ feedback are much greater than if the user was prompted to explain the issue without the presence of empathy. </span></p>
