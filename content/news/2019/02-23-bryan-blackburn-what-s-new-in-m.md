<p class="p3">We are excited about the Madrid release of Software Asset Management (SAM)! We continue to expand use cases, features, and capabilities that make managing, measuring, and optimizing your software easier than ever. As with each release, we actively thought of the user experience and how to best support our customers, simplify processes and create opportunities for success.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p2">Reclamation by Last Used Date</h3>
<p class="p3">The ability to collect a Last Used (or Activity) Date for software via SCCM 2016 and 2012; this date can be used as a proxy for usage metering data to identify and reclaim unused software driving hard dollar savings, alleviating the need to introduce a new agent into your environment.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p4">File-based Discovery and Normalization (<em>Limited Access</em>)</h3>
<p class="p3">This feature enables the identification of software installed on a device/Configuration Item by discovering the file sets and file properties. Based on the millions of rules defined in our Content Library, the attributes discovered on the CI are mapped to a software package. This feature enhances our software discovery and normalization capabilities beyond probe and pattern-based methods.</p>

<p class="p5"> </p>
<h3 class="p4">SaaS License Management (<em>Limited Access</em>)</h3>
<p class="p3">Re-platforming ahead of schedule, SaaS License Management introduces the initial wave of VendorHawk capabilities in Madrid available via Limited Access.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Customers can see their licenses from their top SaaS publishers.  We analyze meaningful usage data from the vendor API to reveal quick value wins such as stale licenses that are under-utilized. Customers can trigger a workflow to reclaim the licenses and appropriately preserve the deleted user&#39;s content before deleting, so no data is lost. Customers can also see an overview of their SaaS subscriptions for Box, Dropbox, DocuSign, Salesforce Sales Cloud, and Salesforce Service Cloud in a dashboard. SaaS publishers will continue to be onboarded in a future release.</p>
