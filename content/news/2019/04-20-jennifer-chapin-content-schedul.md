<p>Hi All, </p>
<p>Due to overwhelming interest and demand for breakout sessions at Knowledge, we are working to increase capacities by moving rooms and making other adjustments to accommodate more people.  Because of that, sessions on your agenda will disappear for a bit while new rooms are assigned and new capacities are added.</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, if you log in to your agenda and see sessions missing, don’t worry!</strong>  Your sessions should reappear by end of day.  However, if you have any issues, log into <a href="https://servicenow.g2planet.com/knowledge2019/myevent_home" rel="nofollow">My Event</a> and add the sessions back to your agenda. In addition, you can reach out to us at <a href="mailto:knowledge&#64;servicenow.com" rel="nofollow">knowledge&#64;servicenow.com</a> or call &#43;1 866-855-3789 (US), &#43;1 650-416-8382 (Intl), Monday – Friday, 6 am – 6 pm PT. </p>
<p>We’ll see you at Knowledge 2019!</p>
<p>Jennifer, for the Events team</p>
