<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Finding the training you are interested in.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are a few ways to explore content on Now Learning. I will be reviewing the ways to filter through the various courses and other types of content available to you.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Let’s start with the basics:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span class="s2"><a href="https://nowlearning.service-now.com/lxp%22%20%5Cl%20%22discover" rel="nofollow"><span class="s3"><strong>Courses</strong></span></a></span> are trainings offered in either a live classroom setting, live in a virtual classroom or on-demand at your own pace.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span class="s2"><a href="https://nowlearning.service-now.com/lxp%22%20%5Cl%20%22discover" rel="nofollow"><span class="s3"><strong>Paths</strong></span></a></span> are one or more trainings that are recommended to be completed in a certain order to achieve a level of mastery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often paths result in a certification.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Certifications </strong>are exams that allow you to validate your ServiceNow knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earning a certification demonstrates your mastery of the skills needed to utilize the ServiceNow Platform.</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span class="s2"><a href="https://nowlearning.service-now.com/lxp%22%20%5Cl%20%22simulators" rel="nofollow"><span class="s3"><strong>Simulators</strong></span></a></span> allow you to learn by doing!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can use our simulators to safely practice your new skills on our popular simulator instances.</span></li></ul>
