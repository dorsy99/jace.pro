<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You might have heard all the buzz around the major release features in the <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;46ee405bdb8bf3405ed4a851ca961992" rel="nofollow">What’s New in New York for HR Service Delivery blog post,</a> such as the new mobile apps, but that’s not all we launched. Here’s a look at some additional enhancements and features we expect will be popular with customers of HR Service Delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Case &amp; Knowledge Management</strong></span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Retain Case Numbers When Reclassifying or Transferring HR Cases</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Users may now select whether they would like to retain the original case number when transferring an HR case. Previously, transferred cases were given a new case number. Now, users may select one of two transfer types as shown below. If the case is transferred with the existing number, the work notes are also retained, and any existing links direct users to the most current, reclassified case.</span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/8e0f149fdbc408105129a851ca961985.iix" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Fulfillment Instructions Can Be Dynamic to Cater to Specific Scenarios</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Through the use of a condition builder, you can now define specific scenarios for when agent fulfillment instructions should differ, such as when the employee is based in a certain location, or maybe has a specific employment status. As part of this enhancement, fulfillment instructions are now a separate module and are no longer part of an HR service. Existing fulfillment instructions will not be impacted; they will still be visible on the service they were associated with, but there is now more flexibility and additional conditions can be built. Note: The HR case Checklist remains on the HR service and appears in a separate tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/465f5853db0808105129a851ca9619ec.iix" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Further Differentiate &amp; Organize Skills with Levels &amp; Taxonomies</strong> </span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Skill levels—such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced—can now be built to further differentiate the skills required to complete certain items. You may also now organize related skills into categories and subcategories.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/f4af5cd7db0808105129a851ca961945.iix" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Employee Service Center</strong></span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Map Articles and Services to the Related Items Widget of a Knowledge Article</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Related articles and catalog items, such as HR Service record producers, can now be directly mapped to a knowledge article to better help users find related information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/e0202cdfdb0808105129a851ca96194d.iix" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Expand or Collapse Knowledge Article Fields and Style with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Improve the display of knowledge articles by setting article template fields to expand or collapse, and style template fields and headers with CSS. This could be especially helpful in </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">making long articles more digestible and user-friendly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/aab0acd7db4808105129a851ca9619f5.iix" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>End a Campaign on Completion of a To-Do</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You can now end a campaign for a user when they’ve completed a to-do to prevent them from being targeted with content that is now irrelevant as a result of completing the to-do. For example, you may wish to end a campaign on benefits enrollment once an employee indicates they’ve completed their enrollment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/4ec1e01bdb8808105129a851ca96197b.iix" /></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Enterprise Onboarding &amp; Transitions</strong></span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Collect Employee Input with Employee Forms</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You can now collect employee input with the use of an employee form built through the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-servicenow-platform/page/administer/survey-administration/concept/c_SurveyDesigner_1.html" rel="nofollow">survey designer</a>. Employee forms can be used in HR tasks, and the information collected can be used to make a downstream decision, such as to trigger a new lifecycle event activity. For example, you might ask a new hire to indicate whether they have inventions, and if they do, you could trigger another task to collect details on the invention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All questions can also be mapped to fields on a target table, so any existing data can be pre-populated, and updates can be pushed back to the corresponding field. Alternatively, fields can also be made read-only, so existing data is displayed, but not editable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This differs from a standard record producer because answers are saved to the Metric Result [asmt_metric_result] table (since the survey designer is being used), and HR criteria records can be used to determine whether a lifecycle event activity should trigger for a user based on the value in the Metric Result table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/3e23ec9fdbc808105129a851ca9619f0.iix" width="544" height="383" /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/6b53c5d3dbc888105129a851ca9619f9.iix" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Capture Multiple Jobs for an Employee</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You can now capture multiple job records per employee and store the job history of users using the new Jobs [sn_hr_core_job] table. This can be especially helpful within a lifecycle event case. For example, if an employee is transferring from one position to another as part of a lifecycle event, this allows you to specify which job the case pertains to so downstream activities are triggered based on information in the relevant job record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/99932417db0c08105129a851ca961936.iix" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>NOW Platform</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /><strong>Knowledge Article Permalinks Open the Latest Version in the Employee Service Center</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When copying the permalink of a knowledge article, it now generates a link that directs users to view the latest version on the Employee Service Center. Previously, users would have been directed to an earlier version of the article with a message re-directing them to the current version. This enhancement improves the article linking experience—permalinks will now direct users to the most recent, user-friendly view of the article.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/64d36097db0c08105129a851ca96194f.iix" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Dynamically Translate Text &amp; Manage Translations Via Tasks</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Translate text in real-time using the new Dynamic Translation feature, which allows you to integrate with translation service providers. This could be especially helpful in managing article translations for a global audience. You may now also elect to manage multi-language knowledge bases using automated translation tasks.</span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/6814601bdb0c08105129a851ca96193f.iix" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt;">Note that at this time, text translations are not available within Virtual Agent and Chat, and licensing with IBM Watson or Azure translation services is required, unless a custom integration with another translation provider is built.</span></p>
