<p><em>ServiceNow’s Drew Hart shares configuration management insights at Knowledge. Here’s a preview.</em></p>
<p>A successful CMDB doesn’t just happen, and it&#39;s about so much more than simply putting configuration information in a database. To add sustainable value, a CMDB implementation needs to be accompanied by clear business objectives, organizational alignment, well-defined processes, and a culture of shared responsibility. At Knowledge, I’ll be talking about the path to an effective CMDB, covering areas such as:</p>
<ul><li>Getting strategic alignment</li><li>Positioning your CMDB to create long-term strategic value add</li><li>Operationalizing your CMDB to create and sustain data quality</li><li>Anticipating future trends that will affect your CMDB</li></ul>
<p>I’ll also be diving into the some of the practical steps in your CMDB journey, including organizational change, scoping, design, deployment, and ongoing value delivery. And, I’ll be talking about how the ServiceNow CMDB supports you through the entire configuration management lifecycle, giving examples of how you can leverage ServiceNow technology to deliver success.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to mature your existing CMDB – or are just starting out – then this session is for you. It’s built on real-world experience and takes a top-down approach, delivering proven insights that you can take away and use. I’m looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
