<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nexen Energy is an upstream oil and gas company that develops resources in Western Canada, the United States, the UK North Sea, and offshore West Africa. A wholly owned subsidiary of China’s CNOOC since 2013, Nexen is committed to responsible development, integrating health, safety, social, environmental, and economic factors into its corporate decisions.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nexen operates in a heavily regulated industry. That makes governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) a top priority. The company has to have strong business controls in place and needs to respond to multiple external audits every year.</span></div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Manual audit processes were time-consuming, inefficient, and lacked visibility</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">However, Nexen was struggling with audits. According to Renato Cunha, IT GRC analyst at Nexen, “We were caught between our external auditors and our internal business stakeholders. Our GRC team would receive hundreds of requests from auditors and assign them manually to control owners. We spent huge amounts of time in follow-up meetings, chasing down requests and updating auditors with evidence. The whole process was incredibly time-consuming and inefficient. And, because we tracked everything manually, we didn’t have real-time, end-to-end visibility of our audit status.”</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>ServiceNow GRC automates the end-to-end audit process</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nexen decided the process needed to change. The company was already using ServiceNow GRC Risk Management, so it made sense to use ServiceNow GRC to manage audits. In addition to implementing ServiceNow® Audit Management, Nexen’s IT GRC team added an audit request form, giving external auditors a simple way to submit evidence requests. The team also configured a dashboard for external auditors, giving them instant visibility of request status and other key information.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now, instead of the GRC team spending its time shuttling requests and evidence back and forth between auditors and control owners, ServiceNow GRC automates the end-to-end process. External auditors simply enter audit requests and ServiceNow automatically routes these to the right control owner. Control owners respond with evidence, which is also maintained in ServiceNow. This frees up the GRC team’s resources to manage SLAs, handle exceptions, and enhance controls and processes.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>60% reduction in email conversations</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The results have been impressive. Cunha says, “With ServiceNow GRC, we now have an external audit process that is sustainable, agile, and transparent. We’ve reduced email conversations by 60% and our deficiencies have gone down by 50%. In fact, we’ve even been able to handle two major ‘Big Four’ audits at the same time.” The ability to track history and store evidence has also been invaluable. Cunha gives an example. “One cold winter’s day, the IT GRC team received an urgent message from senior management about a deficiency. Using ServiceNow Audit Management, the team reported back with the full audit request history, showing that IT had provided all of the requested information and nothing was outstanding. And they responded in less than 30 minutes. Before, this would have taken several hours.” Next up, Nexen plans to enhance its control monitoring processes, as well as its risk and compliance dependency maps. Cunha says, “With ServiceNow GRC, we’ve dramatically strengthened our control posture while reducing effort. We’ve already made huge strides in how we manage risk and respond to audits. Looking forward, we are building on this momentum, ensuring that responsible, transparent management remains at the heart of Nexen’s business.”</span></div>
