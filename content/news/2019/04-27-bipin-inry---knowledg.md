<p>The INRY team is excited to attend Knowledge 2019 as a Platinum sponsor again! Knowing that we will be able to connect with clients, prospective ServiceNow adopters and users alike, we look forward to this event every year. As a ServiceNow Gold partner, we have helped our clients transform work across IT, HR, Customer Service and Security; and many of those transformations started with a simple conversation at a past Knowledge event.</p>
<p> Stop by Booth 1018 to talk with one of our certified consultants about our industry-specific solutions. Or, join in on one of our many Collaboration Corner sessions being held at the booth throughout the week! We have set up a schedule for various clients to collaborate across different topics. Come over to check our schedule or check it out at <a href="http://inry.com/knowledge19" rel="nofollow">http://inry.com/knowledge19</a></p>
<p>Our Collaboration Corner will give you unparalleled access to our leadership, process owner experts and clients alike to share best practices and success stories. </p>
<p>We are proud to bring you a variety of breakout sessions this year as well. We invite you to join us in these sessions to hear from both INRY leaders and our clients about the success they have achieved through their ServiceNow implementations with INRY.</p>
