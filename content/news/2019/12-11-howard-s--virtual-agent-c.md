<p class="ng-scope">Have you tried using the <strong>NOW Virtual Agent</strong> (VA) with <strong>Natural Language Understanding</strong> (NLU) in the <strong>HI Service Portal</strong> yet?  If not, you should give it a try.  If you have, come see the new enhancements we&#39;ve added!  We&#39;re consistently adding more and more topics in an effort to make VA an indispensable tool.  Just this past week, we launched our latest round of conversations, including:</p>
<ul class="ng-scope"><li><strong><em>Search Knowledge Base</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Register for Early Availability / Release Testing Programs</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Join Customer Advisory Board</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Survey / Feedback</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Who are my ServiceNow admins?</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Who is my ServiceNow account representative?</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>When was ServiceNow founded?</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>I need help</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Request to remove demo data</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Update user profile</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>View open cases</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>What&#39;s the difference between a case and an incident?</em></strong></li></ul>

<p class="ng-scope">There&#39;s also some fun topics we&#39;ve added to showcase VA&#39;s growing intelligence, including what the acronym HI stands for (in case you were wondering), how far away is the moon, tell me a joke, and more.  In conjunction with NLU, the hope is that this will allow VA to interact more naturally with the user.</p>

<p class="ng-scope">We&#39;ve now turned our attention to improving the cosmetics and flow of VA, while also continuing to add more conversations in 2020.  In addition, we&#39;re working on activating VA both in the HI Service Portal mobile application and on the HI login page (as a login assistant).</p>
