<p>You can save 60% of the time you spend managing risks with an effective GRC program – the key is continuous monitoring across your enterprise and vendors.  And it’s not just time and money you’ll be saving, but with better business line of sight you’ll increase your protection against breaches (which now cost as much as $3.86M to remediate according to the Ponemon Cost of a Data Breach 2018) and non-compliance that could damage your brand and reputation.</p>
<p>Although you could have easily enabled continuous monitoring for compliance or risk in previous releases, Madrid focuses on making it easier with out of the box capabilities. Additionally, since it’s not just your internal risk posture that successful integrated risk management (IRM) programs address, we’ve further enhanced the Vendor Risk Management application.  Specifically, we’ve added:</p>
<ol><li>Out-of-the-box indicator templates for common risks</li><li>The ability to return risk assessments that were unsatisfactory to vendors</li><li>Enhanced issues management from within the vendor assessment</li><li>A question bank for risk and vendor assessments</li><li>New use case accelerators for NIST RMF and CSF to jumpstart compliance</li></ol>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Making risk monitoring easier</span></h3>
<p>Although there is a potential for risk within any critical process in almost every department, we are initially focusing on monitoring risk for critical vulnerabilities. It requires security insight with business line of sight. Only then can you obtain the actionable insights to efficiently remediate vulnerabilities, the visibility to enable risk-informed decisions, the metrics to drive accountability, and the controls to ensure compliance.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/7d0cf282db7ba3040be6a345ca96193f.iix" /></span></p>
<p>How does it work? Vulnerabilities are ingested from vulnerability scanners; Security Operations Vulnerability Response capabilities can facilitate this from a variety of scanners. The vulnerabilities are related to services that are impacted.  Within GRC a new “Critical Business Services” profile type and indicator templates are used to automatically identify impacted services that are critical in nature, represent a loss of availability/integrity/confidentiality, and are greater than 2 weeks old.  Issues, assigned to the appropriate business service owners, are generated when the risk is identified.  Dynamic dashboards provide an up-to-date view for business stakeholders as risks are identified and remediated. Quickly identifying, prioritizing, and remediating the risk that vulnerabilities represent improves the overall risk posture of an enterprise.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Enhanced third-party risk management</span></h3>
<p>A strong vendor risk management process is essential to strengthening your IRM program.  That’s why we’ve further enhanced our third-party risk application focusing on even better collaboration and issue handling. In Madrid, you have the ability to resubmit questions with internal and external annotations and generate issues from <em>within</em> a questionnaire while reviewing the responses, for incorrect or unsatisfactory answers. From within the “view responses” pop-up all you need to do is select a question, or several questions that you’d like to consolidate within a single issue and hit a new button at the top of the screen. The issue is visible in the related list on the assessment and the issue record contains the identified questions.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/f23cba82db7ba3040be6a345ca961993.iix" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p>You can also automate the process of generating issues through a new Issue Creation Rule.  For example, if the lack of passwords represents a high risk to your business, you can identify that question. Then, if one of your vendors fails to answer it or answers negatively you can automatically generate an issue and if desired, raise a risk to the GRC Risk Management dashboard. Submitting an issue to the vendor makes it visible in the vendor portal and associates it with a questionnaire.</p>
<p>In addition to the ability to annotate questions, which the vendor will see when the questionnaire is returned.  Notes and comments allow communication between you and vendor in real-time</p>
<p>By improving the collaboration and flexibility in responding to assessments, the quality and timeliness of response can be improved.  A faster time to respond and better-quality information results in better management of vendor risk and an improvement of the overall risk posture for your organization.</p>
