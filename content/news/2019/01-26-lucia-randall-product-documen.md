<p>If you visit our <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/" rel="nofollow">product documentation site</a>, you will find some obvious improvements and a few more subtle ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hn3KAd-qI2w" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Our product documentation site has a new look</strong></h2>
<p>We redesigned the site to reflect ServiceNow&#39;s fresh, new branding, but the changes are more than cosmetic. Along the way, we also made some design adjustments to improve the consistency and accessibility of the site&#39;s interface. We hope you like the new experience! </p>

<h3><strong>Improved login experience</strong></h3>
<p>In our <a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;68870958db952f405ed4a851ca96199f" rel="nofollow">October 2018 update</a>, we introduced two key features: the ability to specify and save personal search preferences and the ability to subscribe to content. Because using these features requires you to log in to the documentation site, we made some improvements to the login process so that it won&#39;t interrupt the flow of your work as much. You can now dismiss the login reminder and perform searches without logging in. When you do choose to log in, the site will take you back to the page you were viewing before going to the login page. </p>

<h3><strong>New multilingual support</strong></h3>
<p>We added a list of languages at the top of the product documentation pages and have begun providing translated content on a limited basis. Currently, the London documentation for IT ServiceManagement and Performance Analytics and Reporting is available in both Japanese and German. Preliminary translations in those two languages for Now Platform Capabilities and Now Platform Custom Business Applications are also available and will be finalized soon. </p>

<h3><strong>Easier access to documentation for Mobile</strong></h3>
<p>Looking for information about Mobile? We made it easier to find - just use the tile on the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/category/london" rel="nofollow">documentation homepage</a> for your release family (beginning with Jakarta).</p>

<h3><strong>New content for Madrid</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/category/madrid" rel="nofollow">Documentation for Madrid</a> content became available with Madrid Early Access on January 24th, 2019. If you want to prioritize Madrid content in your search results, remember to update the search preferences in your user profile. </p>
