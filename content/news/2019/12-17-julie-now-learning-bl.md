<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">If you’ve been following along in the previous blogs I’ve written you’ve probably seen references to “Learning Paths” on <a href="https://nowlearning.service-now.com/lxp" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Now Learning</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this blog, I’ll go into more detail about what <a href="https://nowlearning.service-now.com/lxp?id&#61;lxp_catalog&amp;type&#61;path" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Learning Paths</span></a> are and how you can use them to grow your career and become a ServiceNow expert.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">In the past, Learning Paths have simply been a prescribed set of courses to be taken in a specific order to achieve a learning outcome. Now with the launch of Now Learning you can access, track, and be recognized for completion of not only ServiceNow training but for completion of paths as well.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Paths are role-based, predefined and are presented in a specific sequence so you’ll have a guided experience to deepen your expertise. Learning paths are not only tailored to your role but also leveled from beginner to advanced to support you wherever you are in your ServiceNow training journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once you complete a path you’ll earn a badge that allows you to be recognized on your profile!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">The Learning Paths supported by ServiceNow’s Training and Certification team are outlined in this <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/infographic/learning-paths.pdf" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">document</span></a>. In many cases learning paths result in a certification, which you can read more about in our <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/other-document/servicenow-certification-faq.pdf" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Certification FAQ</span></a>. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">What is contained in a Learning Path?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Paths can be comprised of both mandatory and recommended trainings, micro-certifications and mainline certifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All items marked as mandatory with an asterisk (*) are required to be completed for the path to be considered complete and for you to earn a badge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Items that are not marked as mandatory with the asterisk (*) are strongly recommended content that will help you to become the best implementer, administrator, application specialist or developer you can be.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">Learning Paths and Certification</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">As mentioned above, many learning paths result in a certification. For you to be able to register for an attempt at a certification you must first complete the required training path. In the instances where there are multiple required courses in the training path, all of the material from the path is considered to be a source for the exam. The certification exam will cover all topics and functionality instrumental to that certification. All formal certifications have an exam blueprint that describes the exam and its coverage in further detail. At the end of a Mainline path, you will receive a voucher (at no additional cost) as part of the materials for the course.</span></p>
