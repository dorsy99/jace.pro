<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of requests regarding how to best handle attachments on catalog items and record producers in Service Portal. Previously, I had created a widget that allowed developers to make attachments required on a catalog form, but since ServiceNow also added that capability in Madrid I thought it was time for an update. This new release also adds many new features, including Drag &amp; Drop support, all without touching the OOB widgets.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made the Update Set available on <strong>Share</strong> as well as on <a href="https://serviceportal.io/downloads/require-attachments/" rel="nofollow">ServicePortal.io</a></p>
<p><strong>Download</strong></p>
