<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Most of you are familiar with the twice-yearly family releases of the ServiceNow platform and applications. As you can imagine we’re constantly improving the process and finding alternative ways to deliver exciting new features faster.  With the Madrid release that occurred in March, we moved to a store delivery model. </p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>
<p>A store delivery model is great news for you.  It means you can get enhancements sooner since ServiceNow GRC is no longer strictly tied to a twice-yearly schedule. If we have new use case accelerators (our most recent are for NIST RMF and CSF), dashboards, or other functionality we can make much of that available to you between platform releases.  Whatever updates you’ve made between releases will be maintained when you update to the new platform release.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the new process for getting your GRC updates?</strong></p>
<p>Since March the four GRC applications (Policy and Compliance, Risk Management, Audit Management, Vendor Risk Management, plus all the supporting components) became available on the store to be used with the Madrid release.  On the <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/search?category&#61;Governance%252C%2520Risk%2520and%2520Compliance&amp;orderby&#61;rating" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Store</a>, you can easily see what’s available by filtering on GRC.</p>

<ul><li>If you are performing a family release upgrade to Madrid or beyond, all the applications you’ve installed will be upgraded to the minimum required version for that family release.</li><li>If you’re a new customer, you will be required to install the applications from the store. If you need to install in your production environment, you will have to go to the store to complete entitlement and then install the appropriate applications before you can implement your desired aspect of GRC.</li><li>If you are an on-premise customer without store access you will follow the current process to install store applications.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Which applications will you find on the store?</strong></p>
<p>All ServiceNow developed applications for GRC will begin with “GRC:”, third-party applications that work with ServiceNow GRC don’t follow this naming convention.  On the store from ServiceNow you’ll find the four ServiceNow GRC applications and new capabilities like Use Case Accelerators, dashboards, etc.  Below is the current list of ServiceNow applications, be sure to check the release the application supports, more are always being added.  You can also peruse the third-party applications that work with GRC to address GDPR, Vendor Risk, or Integrated Risk Management.</p>
<ol><li>GRC: Audit Management</li><li>GRC: Policy and Compliance Management</li><li>GRC: Risk Management</li><li>GRC: Profiles (automatically installed with Audit, P&amp;C, or Risk)</li><li>GRC: Vendor Risk Management</li><li>GRC: SIG Questionnaire Integration – for the 2017 and 2018 SIG</li><li>GRC: Performance Analytics Premium Integration (available for customers with Professional and Enterprise licenses)</li><li>Performance Analytics - GRC: Audit Management (requires PA Premium be installed)</li><li>Performance Analytics - GRC: Policy and Compliance (requires PA Premium be installed)</li><li>Performance Analytics - GRC: Risk Management (requires PA Premium be installed)</li><li>GRC: Compliance UCF - Download regulatory content and automatically map common controls (additional purchase required)</li><li>GRC: SOX Content Pack</li><li>GRC: NIST RMF Use Case Accelerator</li><li>GRC: NIST CSF Use Case Accelerator</li><li>GRC: RiskLens Integration</li></ol>
<p><strong>If you find it on the store will it support the release your instance is on?</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily.  When you click on the application, you’ll see on the right of the screen the product information.  You will only be able to import applications that are compatible with the release you are on – in this case it’s Madrid.  We may have GRC feature or core application updates that depend on a specific family release.  These will not appear on the store on the same day as the family or platform release, but we attempt to make them available as close to the family release date as possible; in some cases that is prior to the family release date.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can you get notified when new applications are available?</strong></p>
<p>Since we are adding new applications on a regular basis, even between family releases, you&#39;ll want to stay up to date on what&#39;s new. Subscribing to the GRC category so you can be notified via email when a new application is added to that category is the best way to do that. Select the filter next to My Subscriptions then select Governance, Risk, and Compliance from the popup list and hit Save.</p>
