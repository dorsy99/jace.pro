<p>Wipe away those January blues as its that time of the year again when ServiceNow&#39;s next major release, Madrid, is almost upon us. Last week we opened up Early Access for Technology Partners to get their hands on Madrid, running it through its paces and preparing to submit their apps for certification. </p>
<p>The Madrid release has lots of great new features including some that we are very excited about and many other improvements across the platform that will enable technology partners to build apps on the platform that make work, work better.</p>
<p>In this post we&#39;ll provide an overview of all the significant features and improvements that Technology Partners will want to be aware of, whether you are building apps for the ServiceNow Store or OEM. Over the coming weeks look out for more articles that deep dive into some of the specific areas and show how they can be useful to app publishers.</p>

<h3><strong>New Features and Major Enhancements</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/workspace/concept/service-workspace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Agent Workspace</a><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/administer/virtual-agent/concept/virtual-agent-overview.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>Madrid is the first General Availability (GA) release of Agent Workspace and will be the first chance for many of our customers and partners to get their hands on this new interface that is going to transform the world of work for fulfillers and users. If you are working with ITSM, CSM, CMDB or Request then you should be looking at how your application will interact with agents through this new interface. </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-mobile/page/administer/tablet-mobile-ui/concept/mobile-experience.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Mobile</a><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/administer/virtual-agent/concept/virtual-agent-overview.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>Following the acquisition of SkyGiraffe by ServiceNow in late 2017, our engineers have been busy re-platforming the technology to bring a comprehensive mobile platform to the ServiceNow platform. ServiceNow Mobile is built from the ground up to make building apps that are mobile ready faster. If you have an existing mobile capability or think your app will benefit from one then you should look at how ServiceNow Mobile could accelerate your rollout.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-application-development/page/administer/auto-test-framework/concept/automated-test-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Automated Test Framework</a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-release-notes/page/release-notes/application-development/automated-test-framework-rn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">what&#39;s new?</a></span><br />For the second release in a row, ATF receives a lot of attention and new features:</p>
<ul><li>Quick start tests have now been included so you can begin building tests for ServiceNow applications faster</li><li>Smarter suites have been introduced so you can dynamically choose the tests to include based on a filter</li><li>Custom UI test steps allow tests to be built against UI pages and macros</li><li>Parameterised tests let you run the same test but with different inputs multiple times</li><li>... and much more!</li></ul>
<p>If you haven&#39;t yet included ATF tests in your application you should strongly consider it as it will assist your customers in testing your app through their upgrade cycles. It should also form a part of your internal app testing. </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/concept/flow-designer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Flow Designer</a> / <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/concept/integrationhub.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IntegrationHub</a><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/integrationhub-rn.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>Flow Designer continues to grow in capability and Madrid sees many new capabilities including:</p>
<ul><li>Decision tables</li><li>Loops</li><li>Run as</li><li>New Actions</li><li>New API access</li><li>and Reporting on running Flows</li></ul>
<p>IntegrationHub too has added capabilities with the addition of:</p>
<ul><li>SOAP</li><li>and payload builder</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-platform-administration/page/administer/import-sets/concept/concurrent-imports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Concurrent Imports</a><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/authentication-rn.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>For partners who are importing a large amount of data into the instance a great new capability has been added to imports so that they can run concurrently. This allows multiple import set rows to be imported at once. The capability scales with the number of nodes an instance has and is designed specifically for large imports that take a long time to run. The imports can even be sharded so that if order is important you can set precedence. If your application imports a large amount of data, review the capability to ensure your app is compatible and customer&#39;s can take advantage of the concurrency.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/c_ServicePortal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Service Portal</a> and <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/concept/c_ServiceCatalogManagement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Catalog</a><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/service-catalog-rn.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>Support has been added for guided tours in Service Portal, input validation has been expanded to support custom regular expressions, one portal can now have multiple catalogs and additional scoped support for script access has been added. If you use a Service Portal or Service Catalog deep dive into the new features <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/service-portal-rn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/service-catalog-rn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-platform-administration/page/administer/security/concept/instance-security-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instance Security Center</a><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/service-catalog-rn.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>The Instance security dashboard(s) have been replaced with the all new Instance Security Center which extends and consolidates many instance compliance activities in a single console. As an application developer you&#39;ll want to ensure your app stays compliant with the security center.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/product/configuration-management/concept/cnfig-mgmt-and-cmdb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CMDB</a><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/service-catalog-rn.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>A new role has been added to the CMDB security model called &#34;cmdb_read&#34; which is now required for reading the CMDB, this is a significant change as previously some parts of the CMDB were readable without any roles. You may need to update your application&#39;s setup instructions to include this role if you need to read from the CMDB.</p>
<p><strong>New Platform Licensing</strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/service-catalog-rn.html" rel="nofollow"><br /></a>With the launch of Madrid, ServiceNow is introducing a new name and model for platform licensing. Previously known as Platform Runtime (and CreateNow before that) the new App Engine licensing will move to a table based model for determining the value customer&#39;s receive from the ServiceNow platform. Nothing will really change for app publishers who sell paid apps on the Store. But publishers of free apps should be aware of the new licensing and how it will impact their customers. The <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/subscription-management/reference/subscription-management-landing-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Subscription Management</a> model has been upgraded to align with these changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Release Notes by Product</strong></h3>
<p>I&#39;ve covered Platform and Application Development release notes in this article, but if your app has a dependency or adjacency to a ServiceNow product, you should read through that product&#39;s Madrid release notes. I&#39;ve listed those here by product:</p>
