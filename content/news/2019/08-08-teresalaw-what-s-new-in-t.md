<p>Integrated Risk Management assumes that risk can come from a variety of sources.  There is vendor risk, risk generated by digital transformation or changes in your IT infrastructure, software, or services.  You can have risk due to business disruption or because of employee behavior, fraud, or disasters like fire, flood, or earthquakes.</p>
<p>Being able to quickly identify, prioritize, and react to this wide variety of risks is what allows you to do business with confidence.  It also provides a significant competitive advantage since it creates an environment where you can improve your decision making, increase performance, and reduce costs.</p>
<p>The New York <span style="text-decoration: underline;">store</span> release of ServiceNow Governance, Risk, and Compliance continues to help you make doing business less risky.  We’ve enhanced our operational risk capabilities and mobile support so you can do your job whenever and wherever you are.</p>
<h4><strong>Enhancements to Operational Risk</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s begin by looking at the operational risk enhancements in our new GRC: Advanced Risk store application available only in the new Enterprise package.  As opposed to IT risks, which are traditionally associated with IT assets or configuration items that you can find in the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Operational risk can be summarized as human risk; it is the risk of business operations failing due to human error such as: employee errors, system failures, and fraud or other criminal activity. To help ensure we can appropriately identify and prioritize operational risk we’ve added Risk Events and Risk Roll-up.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Events:</strong></p>
<p>Loss Events are traditionally financial losses, gains, and near-misses that occur within an organization. They provide subjective data to better measure and respond to risks. In addition to traditional loss events, ServiceNow Risk Events track other losses such as personnel, information assets, IP, and other events that can&#39;t be defined in the general ledger but must be easily quantified. These are associated with Operational Risk.</p>
<p>Monitoring risk events, relating them to existing risks (if applicable), performing a root-  cause analysis, and tracking the remediation tasks are essential to an effective risk management program. Organizations that understand their losses, through risk events, are better able to understand and respond to overall risk. Risk events provide hard data that allow existing risks to be better quantified and validated, and it can also provide visibility into new risks as risk events often recur.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Roll-up:</strong></p>
<p>The ability to provide decision-makers, at all levels of the business, with up-to-date information regarding the organization&#39;s risk posture is critical in a risk management program. Risk rollup provides the ability to create a risk hierarchy where granular risks roll up to enterprise level risks (ex. “Legal document failure” rolls up to an enterprise risk called “Legal Risk”). Risk scores are calculated at every level of risk (risk statement) from the most granular risk to the highest enterprise level. If a risk exceeds the pre-defined threshold a notification is generated. Risk managers can define multiple branches and levels within the risk hierarchy. ​</p>

<h4><strong>Mobile support </strong></h4>
<p>In New York we’ve also added mobile capabilities. Compliance and Risk Managers, like other users are always on the go making a mobile interface essential to successfully staying on top of risk and compliance activities. This mobile interface for GRC enables risk and compliance managers to stay informed and take action rapidly via their mobile devices​.  The focus is on enabling timely dissemination of alerts and key risk and compliance metrics without the need for customization or code. The result is a better ability to do their job.</p>
<p>The Risk and Compliance Manager apps take the user to their specific role-based interface to view:</p>
<ul><li>Notifications/alerts based on pre-defined criteria without customization or coding. For the Risk app an example might be a high-priority risk has exceeded a pre-set risk appetite value​.</li><li>Reports</li><li>Follow up / checks - send emails/messages to control owners/profile owner in case of breach </li><li>Assign tasks, issues, and remediate tasks</li><li>Approve policies or accept risks</li><li>Attestations/Assessments </li></ul>

<p>This application does require an agent to be installed form the Apple Store or Google Play, and associated with your instance.</p>
<h4><strong>Nomenclature updates</strong></h4>
<p>The last enhancement in New York that I’d like to discuss is the new nomenclature. </p>
<p>In our New York release we saw an opportunity to make our GRC nomenclature more consistent with common industry terminology. The table below provides an overview of the changes you’ll automatically see when you upgrade.</p>
