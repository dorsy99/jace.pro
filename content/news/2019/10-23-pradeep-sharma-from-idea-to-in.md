<p>I wanted to introduce <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;ideas_list&amp;sysparm_module_id&#61;enhancement_requests" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow’s new Idea Portal</a> to all of you innovators. ServiceNow is a company driven by innovation. This forum was established based on the principle that together we can innovate better than alone. This philosophy extends to how we offer our products and services and the value our customers realizes from them. This is a space where you can interact and collaborate with each other; as well as, with ServiceNow for all things app publishing and store related.</p>
<h2>Check out how the Idea Portal works</h2>

<p>The Idea Portal is a new and improved method for you to submit product enhancement requests, view what others have submitted, vote on your favorite ones, and get feedback from ServiceNow product management.</p>
<p>We believe Now Community is the ideal venue to get the best ideas in front of ServiceNow&#39;s product teams, and also a great way for those teams to communicate with all of you. Ideas submitted in isolation can be valuable, but ideas from the best minds in our community, vetted and improved by members collaborating with each other, are even more powerful.</p>
<p>Bonus: The Idea Portal on Community can help be the place that you cultivate and farm ideas, test the waters with your fellow innovators, and get inspiration for your next great app on the Store.  </p>
<h3>With the new Idea Portal you can:</h3>
<ol><li>
<p>Search for existing Ideas to see if you and another user have the same genius</p>
</li><li>
<p>Upvote Ideas you would like to see ServiceNow build into the Now Platform</p>
</li><li>
<p>Add your two-cents to the Idea with comments. This can include a screenshot or mockups!</p>
</li><li>
<p>Submit your own ideas and see what other users think</p>
</li><li>
<p>Take inspiration from Ideas and run with it.</p>
</li></ol>

<p> </p>
<p>ServiceNow’s Product Teams manage the Idea submissions and will change the status of them based on their reviewal. If you see an Idea is not going to be implemented by the ServiceNow Product team, consider working with the original poster to create something great for Store. Of course, don’t steal ideas. Collaborate with and credit users for their contributions and innovation. Together we can make a difference in the world of work one idea at a time.</p>
