<p style="text-align: left;">The <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/company/ventures/creatorcon-challenge.html" rel="nofollow">CreatorCon Challenge</a> entry deadline is March 8th. With that in mind we thought we&#39;d share some tips and insights on what to include in your investor pitch video. At stake is a $250K investment from ServiceNow Ventures and fame and glory at Knowledge19 - so let&#39;s get to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Who will be evaluating my pitch video?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ServiceNow C-level and VP leaders in the platform, ISV partner ecosystem, and innovation parts of the business. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What do I need to include in it?</strong></p>
<ol><li>The problem you’re solving</li><li>Your solution (app) and why it’s the best vs. available alternatives (competitors)</li><li>The market opportunity (your addressable market - size, growth rate, ideal customer/company profile, buyer and evaluator personas)</li><li>Product/market fit in the context of selling to existing ServiceNow customers (how your app complements/extends ServiceNow products in terms of user stories, new use cases, or new departments) - if you intend to sell your app on the ServiceNow Store. If you intend to sell your app in the OEM program, product/market fit in the context of selling into white space (new) markets and buyers not served by ServiceNow. Articulate your product strategy and how it addresses a well defined, unmet market need that a large and growing identifiable group of people or companies have.<br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="07f363cadbe7e7c04abd5583ca9619f5.iix" /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li><li>How you used latest and greatest Now Platform features in <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/blog.do?p&#61;/post/madridpdi/" rel="nofollow">Madrid</a> (or London) (Mobile Studio, Virtual Agent, Flow Designer, Performance Analytics, Service Portal, Agent Intelligence, MetricBase, IntegrationHub, etc.) in your app</li><li>Your founding team’s ability to execute. What backgrounds, expertise, credibility, accomplishments, track records set you up for success.</li><li>Market traction/customer validation you&#39;ve already established</li><li>Your pricing and business model</li><li>Your go-to-market/sales expansion model</li><li>What you will do with the investment should you win</li></ol>
