<p>Hello from the Knowledge Events team!  It’s getting exciting around here as we put plans in place for <a href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Knowledge 2019</a> coming to you from Las Vegas, May 5-9.  If you haven’t registered already, now is the time. We don’t want you to miss our biggest and best event yet.</p>
<p>From now until Knowledge begins, we’ll bring you all the updates right here on this blog.  So, grab your cup of coffee and tune in for the news you need to know.</p>
<p>Speaking of news, today is a big day!  We just announced the opening of our <a href="https://www.servicenowevents.com/knowledge2019/event_agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Content Scheduler</a> so that you can build the agenda just right for you.</p>

<p>Still undecided about Knowledge?  I get it.  Schedules, work commitments and everything in between.  But, if you’re ready to learn how to take work to the next level, I know that these few days will be worth the time.  Come join us. You’ll be glad you did!</p>
<p>Hope to see you in Las Vegas!</p>
