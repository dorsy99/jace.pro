<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The 2020 global forecast for enterprise software spend amounts to $507 billion, with SaaS spend reaching $110 billion (1). Within the first year of implementing a SAM solution, organizations can save up to 30% in software costs. Without proper SAM governance, organizations are at risk for tremendous amounts of software waste (2). By the end of 2020, $152 billion in enterprise software spend and $33 billion for SaaS will be wasted if companies don’t have SAM programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Considering a large amount of IT budget goes to software, SAM governance becomes an important part of a mature IT strategy. Software governance pays close attention to data protection and standards, but it also includes aligning your software and business strategies. Standardized workflows and processes are vital to effective SAM governance which will help mitigate software compliance risk and help you minimize software waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">With potential savings being so great, it’s a wonder why SAM isn’t more of a strategic business initiative. Gartner has been saying SAM should be a C-Level imperative for a while now (3). With complex licensing and pricing models from top publishers, asset managers are faced with a number of challenges when it comes to SaaS and software governance. Below, you will find some common challenges, paired with some simple solutions to elevate your governance practices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">ISO Standards provide a framework guiding the organization to recognized approaches to common IT challenges. For example, common to IT, we see ISO frameworks which are all interconnected:</span></p>

<table style="height: 136px; width: 754px;" border="2"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 375px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">ISO Standard</span></strong></span></td><td style="width: 365px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Common Name associated with the Framework</span></strong></span></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 375px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">ISO/IEC 27701 2019</span></td><td style="width: 365px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) </span></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 375px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></td><td style="width: 365px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Information Security Management</span></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 375px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">ISO/IEC 19770</span></td><td style="width: 365px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Information Technology Asset Management</span></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">For purposes of this blog, let’s take a closer look at ISO 19770 ITAM standards specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">According to ITAMStandards.org (4), “ISO/IEC 19770 is a framework of ITAM processes to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT asset management overall. ISO/IEC 19770 is aligned to Service Management (ISO/IEC 20000) and contains 27 process areas, with objectives and detailed outcomes defined for each. The standard also advocates a tier-based approach to allow organizations to adopt ITAM processes that are suitable to the needs and size of the organization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The objective of the standard is to provide organizations information and assistance to address the risk and cost minimization of ITAM assets. Through implementation, these same organizations will acquire a competitive advantage through:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Management of the risk of interrupted IT service delivery, breach of legal agreements and audit</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Reducing overall software costs through the implementation of various processes</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Better information availability leading to improved decision-making based on accurate data (5)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Better manage software governance on a single platform</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">A single platform can better manage software governance outlined in the ISO standards listed above. As a single source of truth for IT and business data, you can trust that centralized perpetually clean data is being shared and utilized across the organization. Standardized process governance can help companies achieve the ISO objectives, including minimized disruption to service delivery, reduced risk of legal agreement breaches and improved decision making based on accurate data. This increases visibility across the organization to monitor what has been purchased and what is being used by connecting the dots between finance, procurement, HR, GRC, and IT security. A single platform helps determine more clearly if active, in-use software are compliant with IT security standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">With process being a critical component of effective software asset management, a single platform makes creating IT workflows simple. You can automate your workflows to trigger a set of needed actions that strengthen SAM and governance processes. The Now Platform already gives you the ingredients you need to get going in SAM like CMDB, Asset Management, or Discovery, for example. You can also push that enriched software data to other areas of the platform for your cross-functional teams to get major value out of it as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Our customers are saving millions on software spend and we’re helping them mitigate compliance risk. What makes ServiceNow unique, is that you can run SAM natively where you are already managing IT, to get to value much more quickly, better positioning SAM for cross-functional use cases and simplifying how software governance is managed.</span></p>
