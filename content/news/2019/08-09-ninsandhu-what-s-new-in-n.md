We’ve got everything from new mobile apps and enhanced self-service capabilities to out-of-the-box employee journeys and even new integrations! All of this innovation is designed to provide better employee-centric experiences across the enterprise. Here is what you can expect in the New York release for HR Service Delivery:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(New) Mobile Onboarding App</h3>
<p>Say goodbye to bad onboarding experiences and hello to happy new hires! The new purpose-built mobile onboarding app makes it easy for new hires to arrive day one ready by providing a streamlined pre-hire experience. New hires are presented with step-by-step guided to-dos that allows them to seamlessly complete necessary pre-hire activities such as pick a new laptop, review and sign documents, and take the perfect selfie for their new employee badge.</p>

<h3>Enhancing Employee Self-Service with Now Mobile</h3>
<p>Great experiences shouldn’t end once new hires join your company. Every company has its own maze of internal systems and processes that can make even doing the simplest task frustrating, especially with today’s on the go workforce! The new Now® Mobile app takes self-service to the next level by making it easy for employees to make requests, search for knowledge articles, view the status of requests, find other employees, and complete tasks or to-dos on the go, all from one place.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<h3>Parental Leave Content</h3>
<p>Starting a family is a BIG journey and is one of the most important moments in any up and coming parent’s life. Most parents already have a lot on their mind but figuring out how to navigate parental leave shouldn’t be one of those worries. In the New York release, ServiceNow has integrated market research and customer feedback to provide organizations with built-in parental leave content so they can quickly build the best experience possible for expectant parents! The new parental leave journey is designed to help guide employees through the complexity of parental leave, and also help organizations reduce the time and effort needed to create and implement parental leave processes globally.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<h3>Lifecycle Event Builder Enhancements</h3>
<p>In our previous release we launched the new Lifecycle Event Builder, which is designed to easily create and deploy new cross-functional experiences and breakdown the barriers of operating in departmental silos. In the New York release, we have made this experience even better, by allowing department admins to easily iterate and test cross-functional experiences like onboarding in a no-code development environment. Admins can easily walk-thru new activities and workflows and test each scenario of the journey to ensure it provides the best possible experience for employees before going live.</p>

<h3>SAP SuccessFactors Integration</h3>
<p>We are excited to announce our newest Integration with SAP SuccessFactors!
