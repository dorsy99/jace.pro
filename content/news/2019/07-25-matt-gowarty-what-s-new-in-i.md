<p>We are excited about the New York release for ServiceNow® ITOM as we continue to extend visibility across the IT estate, deliver business service health with AIOps and machine learning, and optimize cloud usage and resources. We are constantly improving our capabilities and techniques to enhance the operator experience, and the New York release includes some incredible new capabilities.</p>
<p>The two primary new ITOM features included in New York are:</p>
<ul><li>Mobile interface for ITOM Health </li><li>Google and IBM cloud support for ITOM Visibility and ITOM Optimization</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Mobile interface for ITOM Health</strong></h4>
<p>When it comes to health of business services, speed and actionable intelligence is paramount to reduce risk of potential impact. There are times when an operator is away from their desk and doesn’t have access to the ITOM capabilities and misses critical alerts. Delays of minutes or hours can have a massive negative consequence.</p>
<p>The new mobile interface for ITOM Health reduces the risks and challenges for operators by identifying issues faster with notifications ranked by severity and the ability to compete basic actions anywhere via mobile – even when away from the office. This reduces the risk of degraded service impact with an improved view of IT operations and increases operational effectiveness and responsiveness with enhanced health views and remediation actions.</p>

<h4><strong>Google and IBM cloud support for ITOM Visibility and ITOM Optimization</strong></h4>
<p>As more customers are diversifying cloud deployments across multiple providers to reduce cost and/or add diversity, a lack of visibility and actionable information into multi-cloud or hybrid cloud deployments can increase business risk and add new challenges. Organizations must eliminate disparate and siloed tools to achieve consistent visibility and management across their cloud platforms of choice to provide the resources and business services required by their users.</p>
<p>In the New York release, ITOM Visibility and ITOM Optimization are expanding cloud support capabilities to include Google Compute Platform (GCP) and IBM clouds of SoftLayer and BlueMix. These additions expand the ITOM cloud support which already includes Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. By adding GCP and IBM cloud to the existing support of AWS and Azure, ServiceNow allows customers to have more successful cloud deployments by expanding provisioning and transparency into the leading platforms as more organizations leverage multi-cloud requirements across their IT estate. Operators can map more resources to critical application services. In addition, users can maintain consistency, ensure governance, and ease time to request with self-service provisioning using technologies such as Terraform.</p>
