<p><em>ServiceNow’s head of ITOM Visibility, Sree Subramaniam, shares our exciting progress at Knowledge 2019</em></p>
<p>Time goes so quickly. It only seems like yesterday that we were at Knowledge 2018, but Knowledge 2019 is just around the corner. It just shows the time flies when you’re having fun!</p>
<p><br />Although time has been zipping by, we’ve accomplished a huge amount in the last year. Our ITOM Visibility portfolio has moved forward at a tremendous pace. At Knowledge, I’ll be talking about all of the great new features that we’ve introduced in the last year, and I’ll be giving you an inside look at our next few releases of CMDB, Discovery, and Service Mapping. I’ll also be highlighting why ServiceNow’s ITOM Visibility products are strategic for ServiceNow customers, delivering critical insights into IT infrastructure, applications, and business services.</p>
<p><br />To get all of the details, please join me, Sree Subramaniam, at breakout session BRE1311. See you there!</p>
