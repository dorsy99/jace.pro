<p>Looking for tips on how to make your ServiceNow upgrades, like the one to New York, easier and faster?  Then you will want to attend the webinar, “Fast Track your Next Upgrade.” Our team will present a step‑by‑step guide to accelerating the upgrade process and understanding how to work through customizations that may impact your upgrade. The team will discuss how ServiceNow HealthScan, a new product that reviews code against best practices, can dramatically cut down the time required for your next upgrade. We will discuss applying upgrade best practices, adopting business smart customizations, and using the Automated Test Framework for faster regression testing. IT will share how they use Healthscan in the ServiceNow internal instance.</p>
