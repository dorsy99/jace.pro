<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SNUG Opportunities</strong></span></p>
<p>Members of the HI <span class="normaltextrun">ServiceNow After Sales Service and Support</span> team will be attending some of the November SNUGs. Please let us know if you are going to be in attendance. We are looking for customers to participate in our HI Mobile Early Adopter Program. Basically, it&#39;s an app for HI that we would like you to test drive and provide us feedback on. The app will enable you to <strong>accomplish real tasks that you are already encounter everyday as a HI Admin and ServiceNow customer </strong>but you will be able to complete them on the go using a mobile device.  We are always looking to engage with customers to see how we can improve your experience on the Now Community, HI Service Portal, Virtual Agent and Support and Troubleshooting Knowledge Bases. We look forward to connecting. <br /><br /><strong>Upcoming SNUGs we will be at: </strong><br /><a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_event&amp;sys_id&#61;87291d2a1b54c850ada243f6fe4bcb54" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Seattle SNUG (November 12th)</a><br /><a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_event&amp;sys_id&#61;b3eb14d0dbd8c0d05129a851ca961959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Arizona (November 14th)</a><br /><a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_event&amp;sys_id&#61;21e1361bdbe4cc90feb1a851ca9619b6" rel="nofollow">Colorado (November 19th)<br /><br /></a><strong><a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0781690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">HI Login Issues - Frequently Asked Questions</a></strong><br />The HI Customer Experience team recently authored a <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0781690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">KB article</a> to help you if you have any issues logging into HI. We hope that this article is valuable for you and your teams when you are trying to troubleshoot HI access. <em>Please let us know if you have any other issues</em> you have encountered when attempting to access HI. We can update the article to include those scenarios. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Quick tip:</strong> If you are not sure who your HI Customer Admin is, you can click find out by accessing &#34;Who are my ServiceNow Admins and what can they do?&#34; through the HI Service Catalog. </em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NLU Conversations</strong></span><em><strong><br /></strong></em></p>
<p>Last month, we launched the re-implementation of Virtual Agent in the HI Service Portal (take a look at our <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;8218ede5db18c8105129a851ca9619b8&amp;view_source&#61;searchResult" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">blog</a> postings in the Community).  With this comes the enablement of newly available Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities in the New York release.</p>
<p>We’re excited to be the first to showcase this technology and hope it will increase Virtual Agent’s overall intelligence and ability to comprehend more questions.  NLU should provide an improved experience with personalization and a more natural, conversational flow.</p>
<p>Virtual Agent’s abilities and intelligence will continue to improve as we go, and we’ll continue to train it to understand more variations of how to ask the same question, or in “NLU-speak” – utterances.  The continual training will enable the NLU confidence scores (that it understood the correct intent) to improve.  Similar to how Siri and Alexa have improved over time, the hope is that you will come to rely on VA to help get what you need faster and more efficiently.</p>

<p>Idea portal on Community went live to all customers last month, allowing better visibility &amp; crowdsourcing of product ideas. Customers can now submit ideas for product enhancements, have them voted on by fellow members, and the top ranked ideas will be routed for review by product managers. Post-go-live, we have seen more than 850 Ideas submitted, including 5 ideas that have received more than 90 votes.</p>
