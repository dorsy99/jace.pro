<p>Ever have some code you just can&#39;t find?  Well I made an app to make it easy to search for the code.  Really its just exposing the Studio Search to many more tables.  But I thought I&#39;d post about it here.<br />Link to share:</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/share/contents/7596230_code_share_for_sp?v&#61;2.4&amp;t&#61;PRODUCT_DETAILS" rel="nofollow">https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/share/contents/7596230_code_share_for_sp?v&#61;2.4&amp;t&#61;PRODUCT_DETAILS</a></p>
<p>Don&#39;t want to look at the share and just try it out, Open Studio, Import from Source, paste in https://github.com/jacebenson/servicenow-codesearch.git no user or pass needed</p>
<p>Easily accessible to users with admin role only.</p>
<p>Created a /code sp site with just the one page.  URL to search if you dont want to wait for the load /code?q&#61;term</p>
<p>Also since you may not trust everyone, the code is open on github and accepting pull requests: <a href="https://github.com/jacebenson/servicenow-codesearch/tree/docs" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jacebenson/servicenow-codesearch/tree/docs</a>  [Code is on &#34;master&#34; branch]</p>
