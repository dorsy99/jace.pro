<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I was privileged to, within our weekly PAR office hours, present one of our great out of the box data visualizations we have inside our platform. This being the geographical map report. Personally I think (together with Performance Analytics Workbench and Text analytics WordCloud) the most powerful and informative data visual within our platform. And we have many!</p>
<p>Creating meaningful and action oriented visuals and charts is not easy, but super important. As your goal is, for your consumers to create something that will immediately tell a data visualization story, that gets to the point and would drive them to an insight and with that, an action.</p>
<p>During the presentation I elaborated what the capabilities of this map report are. Around interactivity and action-ability. How easy it is to create a Map report, but does have the need for a good supporting data model based on locations table or latitude/longitude data. If configured correctly the possibilities are endless, with adding your own hierarchy, click through as well as custom maps.</p>
<p>Always remember the best practices:</p>
<ol><li>Use the Map report when the location (in relation with volume) makes the point</li><li>Align your data model for seamless in platform real time visualizations</li><li>Start with the out of the box map sources and maps</li></ol>
