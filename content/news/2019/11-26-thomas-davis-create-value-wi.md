<p><strong>A description</strong> is like the marketing copy used to describe a product’s value to a potential customer. A descriptive <strong>Description</strong> provides customers with details around features, problems it solves and other benefits to help generate value you in its use. <strong>A Description</strong> is one of the three key elements in fiction, so it holds very strong power in helping someone understand what they are getting with it. And in ServiceNow Performance Analytics, the value is as important as it would be a novel!!!</p>
<p><strong>Descriptions</strong> give you the potential opportunity to have some Governance around what is being created. Encourage people to go and look at what is already available and read the <strong>Description</strong>. In a lot of situations, something is already out there that will work. What we don’t want is creation to happen, just to happen. Things that are created should have value and be something new. Creating something with a different name, but does the same as something else, is redundant and unnecessary.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Here are some examples of places that <strong>Descriptions</strong> have incredible value. <br /><em>(Honestly, get in the habit of putting a </em><strong><em>Description</em></strong><em> anywhere that allows it)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The list can go on and on, of where you should use <strong>Descriptions</strong>.
