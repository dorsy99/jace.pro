<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Whether you’re a new ServiceNow customer or have been using the platform for a while, you’ve heard how important a quality CMDB is to enabling desired outcomes for the solutions you’ve invested in. A well-configured CMDB can save you as much as 40% in IT costs, and help you avoid the costs of unplanned outages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In order to achieve a quality CMDB that’s going to provide valuable outcomes for your organization, the data in the CMDB must be aligned with supporting specific business goals and there must be governance in place to ensure the data continues to meet your evolving goals. The only way to ensure this alignment is to perform thorough planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Let’s get started!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://community.servicenow.com/6497636fdb9cff88d82ffb24399619a1.iix" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Set Your Direction</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">As the late great Yogi Berra once said, “If you don&#39;t know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else.” </span><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">This quote applies across our work and personal lives, and let’s talk about two examples to truly understand its importance. When is the last time you got into your car, opened up Waze and decided to let it choose your destination? There&#39;s a reason why the first thing Waze asks for is your destination and that is to be able to plot the most successful path to achieve your desired outcome (ex. getting to your son’s LAX game on time). Another example would be meeting with a weight loss coach and when they ask what your goal weight is you tell them you don’t have one. In order for the coach to craft a weight loss plan specific for you, they need to understand what goal you are working towards in order to achieve your desired outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">By now you must be asking what these use cases have to do with your CMDB. Both of these are very different, but the most important thing they have in common is that each one has unique goals in order to achieve desired outcomes. The same concept applies to CMDB design. When designing a CMDB, there are numerous possible use cases and each use case must have goals in order to provide desired outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Focus Your Use Cases</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In order to set goals for your CMDB, the first step is to narrow your focus to a specific set of use cases that tie directly to the strategic initiatives of your organization. Start with the critical few and add more over time. Here are some of the most common use cases we see our customers starting with:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Change Impact Analysis</span> – If we need to change something in our data center, how will this affect our business?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Software License Compliance</span> – How can I see what software is installed across our environment so that I can determine my license compliance position?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cloud-First Strategy</span> – How can we keep track of spinning up and spinning down of ephemeral services in the cloud to control spending?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Risk</span> – If there is a vulnerability against a specific operating system, how will this affect our business? What priority should I patch the affected servers?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reducing Service Outages</span> – If there is a critical alert on a server, how can I quickly determine business impact to prioritize which alerts to work first?</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Define Your Specific Goals</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Once you’ve narrowed down your set of use cases, the next step is to articulate well-stated goals. We suggest using this format:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">To<br /></span><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• &lt;do what&gt; (expressed in culturally accepted terms</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">)<br />In such a way that</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• &lt;how it must be done&gt; (constraints, assumptions, must haves)</span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">So that</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• &lt;why it must be done&gt; (strategic goals and objectives)</span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">And can be measured by</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• &lt;how will we know if we are doing it right&gt; (quantitative – not qualitative)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Here is an example:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">To</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Implement Configuration Management</span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In such a way that</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Provides support for cloud computing and a cloud-driven demand model </span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Provides underpinning data for demand management as new market segments are identified and implemented</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Provides improved data availability to IT Information Security including a model for understanding the business context of deployed workloads</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Enhances change collision detection/ proactive change management impact analysis </span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Provides additional data for Incident Management, Problem Management and Event Management</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Facilitates improved collaboration and cooperation across the organization</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Provides data to support contracts with external service providers</span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">So that</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• &lt;company&gt; can expand into market segments</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• &lt;company&gt; implements a cloud-first strategy</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• &lt;company&gt; is better positioned to support audits / regulatory requirements </span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Information security and privacy efforts have information and insights needed to support their goals and objectives</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Provides data to support a cohesive IT strategic planning across every phase of the service lifecycle</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• There is a Single Source of Truth describing how the IT infrastructure supports our business </span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Provides better insight to IT operational environments</span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">And can be measured by</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Visibility of the number of workloads deployed into a cloud</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Visibility of planned and unplanned changes as a percentage of total changes</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Perceived value-add from the CMDB for the expansion of markets </span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Successful change rate increases</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Mean-Time-to-Repair of decreases.</span><br /><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">• Improved perception of IT as an enabler of the business</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In my last blog, I wrote about the <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;5ba3e188db566b0011762183ca96199f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Power of IT &amp; Security Operations on a Common Platform</a> which is aligned to the bottom two use cases above. None of what I wrote about is possible without a CMDB that is designed around specific goals for these specific use cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You&#39;ve Defined Your Goals, Now What?</strong></span><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Goal setting is the first and most important step of getting started with planning a CMDB. This <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/success/playbook/cmdb-deployment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">playbook</a> will help you understand the remaining steps to a quality CMDB.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In addition to the session hosted by ServiceNow, there are 100 search results for the keyword &#34;CMDB&#34; in the <a href="https://www.servicenowevents.com/knowledge2019/content_catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Knowledge 19 Content Catalog</a> and most of these sessions are being delivered by our great customers who are sharing their CMDB success stories. As a former customer and four-time Knowledge attendee myself, I found that attending customer-led sessions is the best way to understand how ServiceNow solutions are actually being used in the real-world and the effort it took to realize value.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Remember, Always Plan Before Doing!</strong></span><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">ServiceNow offers several methods to populate your CMDB; from automated <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/discovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Discovery</a> and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/service-mapping.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Service Mapping</a> to integrations with <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-platform-administration/page/integrate/concept/c_IntegrateWThirdPartyAppsDataSrces.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">third-party applications</a> to manual updates, and most of our customers will use a combination of these methods. However, before configuring any of these solutions to import data, it is imperative to have a plan.</span></p>
