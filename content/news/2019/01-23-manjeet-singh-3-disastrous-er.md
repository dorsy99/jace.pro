<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We know that many surveys are badly written and yield unwanted results. But the worse part in Surveys are when we ask 3 types of questions that manage the relationship with the survey taker.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2">1. Asking questions for which you already know the answers</h2>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As you know, our time is our most valuable asset. Yet many survey creators often expect their respondents to spend their limited time providing known answers. This type of question usually discourages people from answering most surveys.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here are two examples:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span class="s1">• </span>Post Training Survey: Asking students to fill in any information that could already have been pre-filled on the form such as instructor name, course title, location or session.</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span class="s1">• </span>Customer feedback surveys: Asking recent customers for information that they know is already recorded elsewhere, such as their full name, email address and date of most recent purchase.</span></li></ul>
<h2 class="p2">2. Misuse of the “not applicable” and “neutral” options</h2>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One way of losing information is by allowing respondents to skip questions for which they certainly hold an opinion.  Surveys often contain options labeled “Not Applicable” or “Neither Agree nor Disagree” or “Neutral”. These choices are appropriate when respondents may not have the information or experience to answer.  But they should be used strategically, not provided as an option for all questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here are two examples:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span class="s1">• </span>Overall, my experience at this store was:  Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor / Not Applicable. (If a person indeed visited the store, then showing Not Applicable as an option is not a good idea)</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span class="s1">• </span>My Coach’s communication style was effective:   Strongly Agree / Agree / Disagree / Strongly Disagree / N/A - (If you attended the Coaching session, you certainly have an opinion)</span></li></ul>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Providing a “N/A” option allows the respondent to prevent you from learning her opinion.  The N/A option may be fine for other categories, such as questions about customer service, which the respondent may not have used.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Asking a question when no change can be made</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When you ask a question and collect feedback, and those things are not changed, this will be interpreted by some respondents that you are not listening to what they say. You actually may be listening, but simply cannot change those things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here are two examples found on Surveys at training events or conferences:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span class="s1">• </span>Did you like the location for our event? (And location is already finalized for the next event)</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span class="s1">• </span>Was the classroom sufficient size for interaction? (Class size has been the same from last few trainings with no plan to change)</span></li></ul>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">These questions are similar but more disastrous in that they give respondents the impression that change is possible based on what they say, but there really is no intention of changing. Many respondents will be aware of this and then wonder why their time is being wasted.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2">Key Takeaway:</h2>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Re-read each question and choices on your survey and ask yourself these questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Do we already know the answer? Have we already asked this question? Can the answer be obtained from our records?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. Carefully review each option on your survey that contains a neutral option.  Consider whether there could be a situation in which respondents will not have sufficient information or experience to answer.  Only for those items should a neutral option be present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. If a majority of respondents agree that a change should be made, can it be made? If a change cannot be made then do not ask the question.</span></p>
