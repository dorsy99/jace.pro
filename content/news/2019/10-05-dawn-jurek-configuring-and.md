<p>Onboarding provides a complex challenge for most organizations:</p>
<ul><li>Coordinating activities across multiple departments, such as IT and HR</li><li>Providing a consistent experience for each new hire</li><li>Getting new hires ready for day one</li></ul>
<p>ServiceNow just made it easier with the Mobile Onboarding app. Available with Enterprise Onboarding and Transitions in the New York release, this purpose-built app allows new hires to complete onboarding tasks from multiple departments on a mobile device, so they can be day one ready.</p>
<p>These tasks can leverage native mobile capabilities, allowing new hires to perform actions such as:</p>
<ul><li>Getting help from IT about equipment setup</li><li>Signing an electronic document from Legal</li><li>Watching a welcome video shared by HR</li><li>Taking an employee badge photo for Facilities</li><li>Setting up direct deposit with Payroll</li></ul>
