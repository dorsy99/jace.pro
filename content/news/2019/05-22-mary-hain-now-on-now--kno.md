<p>At Knowledge this year, ServiceNow practitioners discussed how we use our own products to automate workflows in areas ranging from IT to Customer Service, HR, Security, ITSM, ITOM, Mobile, and the Employee Experience.</p>
<p>These presentations are now available for viewing in the Community to those that attended Knowledge. They address our challenges, implementation strategies, resulting benefits, and lessons learned. The presentations are a good place to find relevant content.Â </p>
<p>See the attachment below for a list of links to the Now on Now sessions. Stay tuned; we will also let you know when the recordings are available.</p>
