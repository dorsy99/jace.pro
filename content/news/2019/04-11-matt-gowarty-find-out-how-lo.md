<p>Knowledge is a great place for ServiceNow users to share experiences and learn from each other. That’s why I’m so excited to be presenting at Knowledge 2019. My name is Louis Oliver, and I’m a Senior Technical Consultant at Mary Kay. I’ll be talking about Mary Kay’s experience with the new alert management capabilities in ServiceNow’s London release, and about how these are a major step forward compared to previous releases.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Mary Kay, we’re a multibillion-dollar beauty products company. We market our products through an international network of independent beauty consultants, giving women around the world the opportunity to achieve their entrepreneurial goals by creating successful businesses built on cutting-edge, safe beauty products that put customers first.</p>
<p><strong>London’s new alert management features simplify and accelerate alert processing and administration</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve looked at Event Management in London, you’ve probably noticed that you have to change the way that you manage alerts. While change is always challenging, the new alert management capabilities in London open up a world of possibilities that didn’t exist before with alert actions. Based on our experience, we think the effort of migrating is well worth it.</p>
<p>One of the big benefits I’ll be discussing is how alert management gives you the ability to streamline alert processing and simplify alert administration. With flows, subflows, automated remediation, and other capabilities in London, the options are almost unlimited – as are the opportunities to do things better.  In the session, I’ll walk you through our alert management journey at Mary Kay, taking us from a cumbersome, hard-to-track set of alert action rules to a sleek alert management system that is fast and easy to use.</p>
<p>And, best of all, we didn’t have to become ServiceNow developers to make the transition!</p>
<p><strong>Still maturing your CMDB? Alert management bridges the gap</strong></p>
<p>This session is also a must if you don’t have a mature CMDB. We’ve found that alert management can help to overcome the pain of a CMDB that is still coming of age, keeping you moving forward while your CMDB matures. I’ll be sharing some practical examples, hopefully giving you another great reason to upgrade to London!</p>

<p>To find out more, please join me at my Knowledge breakout session. Just look for session BRE0088, titled “Going with the flow – migrating from alert action to alert management with flows.” I’m looking forward to meeting you, and I’ll be happy to answer any of your questions during the session.</p>
<p>See you at the session!</p>
