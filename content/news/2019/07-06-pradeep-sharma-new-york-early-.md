<p class="ng-scope">Note: <em>Do not publish/demo/promote in any way your New York instance to anyone who has not agreed to our program&#39;s legal terms and conditions (completed when joining the TPP).</em></p>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Why do we provide early access to technology partners?</strong></p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>In order for partners to test their apps against the New York release and address any bugs or changes by the time New York goes GA and their customers start to upgrade.</li><li>In order for partners to assess new features in New York, and determine which should be incorporated into their store apps.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Early Access Expectations</strong></p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>Partners are expected to use early access to test their apps against the New York release.</li><li>Partners are expected to submit their application for certification or recertification on the New York release once New York certification opens. *Failure to submit for New York certification may disqualify you from future early access.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Eligibility<br /></strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">In order to qualify for New York early access you must:</p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>Be a current Technology Partner.</li><li>Have an app currently certified on Madrid.</li><li>Be requesting an upgrade to a single vendor instance.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>How should partners be testing their apps in the New York release?</strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">You should be testing for both applications already in instances when they&#39;re upgraded and then installing the app onto a clean instance.</p>
<ol class="ng-scope"><li>Request early access for a vendor instance which already has your app installed on it.</li><li>In the newly upgraded New York instance run through your application test cases.</li><li>Request a zboot (instance reset) of that instance on hi.</li><li>Install your app onto the newly zbooted, clean New York instance and run through your functional test cases.</li></ol>
<p class="ng-scope"><em>Going through this process will test your app for both customers who are upgrading to New York and customers who are installing it for the first time onto New York.</em> </p>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>How do you request Early Access?</strong></p>
