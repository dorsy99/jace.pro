<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>File signature-based discovery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;">Want to improve visibility to your software estate?? Get the best visibility to your installed software estate via file signature-based discovery feature with Madrid release. This is a limited access feature, to enable customers to scan a file system, identify file fingerprints, which can then be used to detect an installed software with a lookup to comprehensive software normalization library.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">“<em>Software asset management and Discovery has a symbiotic relationship</em>,” said an early access customer. Discovery of installed software sets the foundation for enabling better outcomes to software audits. One of the early adaptors of this feature was able to scan the file system where Java is installed and was able to demonstrate the value of this feature to their management.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Few early adaptors also highlighted how they plan to use this feature for key SecOps use cases. A customer talked about their struggle to track OpenSSL software to mitigate &#39;Heartbleed&#39; vulnerability. In fact, Heartbleed lived in the OpenSSL code for nearly two and a half years before a developer at Google spotted it in 2014 and the vulnerability was fixed. Still, the bug continues to live on hundreds of thousands of devices with bundled software, many of which are unlikely to ever get patched.</span></p>

<p><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">NextGen UX for CMDB/Discovery data consumption via Agent Workspace</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Delivering customer delight through a brand-new user experience was the slogan announced in K18 with the launch of Agent workspace. With Madrid release, we are happy to announce the launch of enhanced CMDB data visualization in agent workspace.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">An early adopter customer calls CMDB agent workspace as “modern, faster, and responsive user interface with context driven discovery and service mapping data helping service desk agents &amp; customer service agents”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Agent Workspace for CMDB provides an easy-to-navigate interface that helps service agents access essential CMDB configuration items and drill-down to related items such as changes, incidents, and timeline. CMDB Agent workspace has several notable UX redesign components which will enhance the data visualization and consumption of Configuration Items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Some of the key elements include</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">• Key health scores for CIs: enhanced visibility to process owners to validate the CMDB CI health metrics. </span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">• Level 1 CI relationships: dependency view for impact analysis. </span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">• Condensed timeline view of incidents, changes, and change requests for a CI, for the past 7, 14 (default): snapshot view which can help service desk agents to get visibility to critical changes / Incidents related to a configuration item. </span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">• Critical incidents and change requests for CIs</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">• Critical attributes related to CIs: Visibility to data populated by your discovery tool. </span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">• Ability to create incidents and change requests for CIs, and to delete a CI: Simple actions which can enhance service desk agents to create incidents from a configuration item.</span></p>
<p> <br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Enhanced visibility to discovery performance metrics</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Visibility to discovery job performance is vital for discovery administrators to constantly tweak the discovery schedules to keep the discovery engine alive. This discovery feature will collect performance metrics on probe/pattern and sensor processing times and then aggregates that data over time. This feature also allows the roll-up data to monitor the performance of specific discovery jobs and compare performance between different discovery schedules or compare the discovery run performance during versions upgrades.</span></p>
