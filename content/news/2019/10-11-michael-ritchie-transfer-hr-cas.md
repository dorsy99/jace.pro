<p>The HRSD application has offered a transfer feature for several releases allowing an agent to transfer a case from one HR COE to another.  In the NY release this was improved upon allowing you to &#34;<a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-hr-service-delivery/page/product/human-resources/concept/reclassify-hr-case.html" rel="nofollow">Reclassify an HR Case</a>&#34; and giving you an option to keep the same case number during the transfer process.  This enhancement also opened up the ability to define your own additional transfer methods as well.</p>
<p>One thing missing out of the box is the ability to transfer an HR Case to an Incident.  There are situations where a new hire calls HR for issues about their new computer and obviously IT needs to be engaged to address the issue. This can be a tricky enhancement because there are process and security considerations to address during the implementation.</p>
<p>Utilizing the NY Transfer Case framework, a solution has been posted to ServiceNow Share that will add a new Transfer type allowing an HR Agent to transfer the case to an IT Incident:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Features built into this solution:</strong></span></p>
<ul><li>Since both HR Case and Incident extend the &#34;task&#34; table there are many common attributes such as Short Description, Opened By, Contact Type, etc that will map over.  This same feature is utilized when transferring an HR Case to another COE where common attributes are synchronized.  Any attribute set on the HR Case that isn&#39;t mapped over will appear in a Work Note on the Incident labeled &#34;Non-transferable fields&#34;.</li><li>
<ul><li>Please be mindful of any sensitive data that may exist in the case that shouldn&#39;t be inserted into the incident.  You may need to modify the IncidentTransfer Script Include&#39;s transferCase() function to ignore those fields.</li></ul>
</li><li>The Incident Caller (caller_id) field will be filled in with the HR Case&#39;s Subject Person, Opened By will be filled in with the HR Agent.</li><li>When the HR Agent chooses the &#39;Transfer to IT Incident&#39; transfer type, an Incident Template selection box will appear.  Templates are an easy to use platform wide feature that allow you to set values in a record.  Templates are leveraged across the HRSD application and are also utilized by this solution where Incident attributes such as the Incident category, assignment group, short description, etc are set by the template chosen by the HR Agent (if available).  IT can own/manage these templates and set the group value to HR Groups so that HR has access to them.</li><li>The Incident Template selection box:</li><li>
<ul><li>Displays a list of Templates (sys_template) for the &#34;incident&#34; table where the Group is one of the logged in user&#39;s active HR groups.  Group Hierarchy is considered in the user&#39;s active HR group list:</li><li>
<ul><li>The list will include child groups to the groups that the user is a direct member of.</li><li>This will allow templates to be set at any level in the hierarchy and allow them to be available.  For example, lets say you have an HR IT group with two child HR IT groups called HR IT AMS and HR IT EMEA.  If you only want the HR IT AMS group to be able to transfer cases to incidents, set the template group to HR IT AMS.  If you want both groups to have this functionality, set the group to the parent HR IT group.</li><li>The only exception to the group hierarchy is with the parent &#34;HR&#34; group.  Out of the box all HR groups have a parent set to &#34;HR&#34; so this group is specifically excluded so that the user doesn&#39;t get all templates.</li><li>
<ul><li>If you have removed this out of the box group and set a new group as the parent, please edit the included IncidentTransfer Script Include&#39;s getUserGroups() function on line 137 to match the sys_id of the parent HR group.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>If the logged in user isn&#39;t assigned to any HR groups linked to incident templates, the &#39;Transfer to IT Incident&#39; transfer type will <strong>NOT</strong> appear for that user</li><li>If the user only has access to a single incident template, the Incident Template field will be read only and the user simply needs to click OK to transfer the incident to IT</li></ul>
</li><li>A template called &#34;HR Case to IT Incident&#34; is included with the Share solution so that this functionality may work once loaded.  Feel free to rename this template to your liking or even remove it.</li><li>Once an HR Case is transferred to an IT Incident:</li><li>
<ul><li>The Incident&#39;s Parent field will be filled in with the original HR Case number, and the HR Case&#39;s Transfer to field will be filled in with the new Incident&#39;s number</li><li>Following the out of the box transfer process, the original HR case will be cancelled</li></ul>

</li><li>Add any additional incident templates that you may need and set the group according to who needs access to that template</li></ul>
