<p>Hello IT Business Management community,</p>
<p>We have opened our call for content process for customers who would like to present their ITBM solutions, projects and business impact at Knowledge 2020. We are actively seeking customers who would like to present on topics for Project Portfolio Management, Application Portfolio Management or Agile Management via link below.</p>

<p>All ideas and topics are welcome. Throughout the year we have discussed with our clients several areas of interest, including; aligning strategic investments and initiatives to business objectives/value, scaling work from traditional to hybrid to Agile methods, capturing demand via IT Service Management, IT portfolio cost management, and creating alignment between application investments and business priorities.</p>
<p>The Knowledge event is a great conference for all of us to listen to our peers and ServiceNow team members discuss how they leverage ITBM solutions and create a meaningful impact to IT and the business.
