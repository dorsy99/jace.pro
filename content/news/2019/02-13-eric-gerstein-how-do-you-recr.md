<p>You’ve decided to <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/bp/subpillar19-champions.pptx" rel="nofollow">build a community of champions</a> to drive awareness and support for your ServiceNow programs, but how do you recruit <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/other-document/csc/champions.pdf" rel="nofollow">champions</a> to support your efforts? How many champions do you need to recruit?</p>
<p>To help with this, we’ve highlighted three questions to consider when recruiting champions for your ServiceNow implementation:</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>1. What is a ServiceNow Champion?</strong></h4>
<p>ServiceNow Champions are <strong>influential people</strong> from different teams and roles (e.g. team leads, process users, users, etc.) who are affected by the ServiceNow implementation. They’re already willing to help make your ServiceNow project more successful.</p>
<p>Champions are important because they <strong>help inform implementation planning, communication, training and go-live preparation.</strong> They understand what people in the organization need to be able to effectively adopt ServiceNow.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>2. How many ServiceNow champions do you need?</strong></h4>
<p>This depends on how big your organization is and the number of people using ServiceNow. Use these guidelines:</p>

<p>* Different products will require different types of champions, so these numbers are a guideline for how many champions you may need per ServiceNow product implemented in your organization (e.g., ITSM, ITOM, ITBM, SAM, HR, CSM).</p>
