<p class="p1"> I&#39;m a relative newbie to ServiceNow, but I&#39;ve been in the events industry for nearly 15 years and I&#39;ve worked on countless teams preparing for event launches. Recently, it&#39;s been amazing to see how the teams here, well, work.</p>
<p class="p2">The pride of work well done shone strong recently with the successful launch of not one, not two, but <strong><em>ELEVEN</em></strong> registration sites for the Now at Work series this fall. We couldn&#39;t be more thrilled to open this up to the ServiceNow community.</p>
<p class="p2">Now at Work 2019 (formerly known as the Now Forums and Now Summits) is bringing together extraordinary people like yourself who are transforming the world of work. </p>
<p class="p2">Now at Work 2019 features inspiring keynotes by ServiceNow thought leaders and customers, workflow breakout sessions, and great networking opportunities with others in your field. You’ll get a chance to see how our partners enhance the ServiceNow experience in the Now Expo. And developers, you’ll be able to sign up for CreatorCon workshops and hands-on labs offered at several locations.<br /> <br />Learn more about the events planned in each of 11 cities below. Check out the keynote speaker and agenda details, and... register! These events are complimentary.</p>
