<h1>Learn about observability with Datadog &#64; Knowledge 2019</h1>
<p> Datadog is proud to sponsor Knowledge 2019, and our team is excited to show you how we can help you get deeper visibility into your infrastructure and applications. Datadog is a SaaS platform that brings together infrastructure monitoring, log management, application performance monitoring, and synthetic tests of application functionality and usability. Drop by our booth at Knowledge 2019 to meet the team and see Datadog in action!</p>
<h2>Datadog &#43; ServiceNow</h2>
<p>Datadog <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/" rel="nofollow">integrates with more than 250 technologies</a> out of the box, including ServiceNow.</p>
<p> With the two-way integration between Datadog and ServiceNow, you can:</p>
<ul><li>Push incidents and/or events to your ServiceNow instance</li><li>Discover and update hosts in your ServiceNow CMDB [New beta!]</li><li>Pull host and service metadata from ServiceNow CMDB to Datadog for data visualization and alerting [New beta!]</li></ul>
<h3>Incidents and Events</h3>
<p>Automatically create incidents or events in ServiceNow using Datadog anomaly detection, forecasting, or any <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/monitor_types/" rel="nofollow">other alert type</a> simply by mentioning &#64;servicenowin your alert message. Assignment Groups are automatically pulled in from ServiceNow when the integration is enabled and can also be used for notification/routing.</p>
<p>For example, you can create a ServiceNow incident when a node is forecast to run out of disk space in the near future:</p>
<p><img src="https://community.servicenow.com/8514284cdbd1b388feb1a851ca961943.iix" /></p>
<p>When the alert recovers, the associated support ticket in ServiceNow is automatically marked as resolved. <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/servicenow/" rel="nofollow">Visit our documentation</a> to learn more about setting up and customizing the ServiceNow integration.</p>
<h3><strong>Discovery and CMDB Sync</strong></h3>
<p>With our new host discovery and CMDB sync, currently in beta, you can ensure your ServiceNow CMDB reflects the latest state of your infrastructure even in today’s highly ephemeral cloud environments. Additionally, you can leverage the business and service metadata that already exists in your CMDB for context when triaging and troubleshooting issues in Datadog. Come see us at our booth to find out more!</p>
