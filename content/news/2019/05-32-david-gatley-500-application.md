<p>In just past it&#39;s 4th year since launch, the ServiceNow <a title="ServiceNow Store" href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Store</a> has hit an epic milestone, 500 certified applications!!! Something I&#39;m personally honored to commemorate here with all of you.</p>
<p>This was reached due to the incredible work from our ISV and OEM partner community striving to build enterprise-ready, consumer-grade, certified applications and integrations. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at how we got here:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/5870f4b0dbbdb7801cd8a345ca9619be.iix" /></p>
<p>These applications and integrations represent weeks and/or months of significant development by each of our Technology Partners. These solutions are all certified, that is to say they have all passed certification criteria including metadata, interoperability, security and performance testing. Our partners are solving real business problems with custom applications that bring immediate value to our customers. You won&#39;t find vaporware, marketing documents, outdated content, nor any other kind of fluff. This is a marketplace that showcases real code, built atop the ServiceNow Platform, all purpose built to make the ServiceNow customer base even more empowered to make their world of work, work better!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been here since we had 0 certified apps on a marketplace, 500 is just the beginning. I&#39;m honored to be the one to share this milestone, but it took a village to get here. There&#39;s a amazing ServiceNow team behind the past 4 years of effort, helping empower our ISV&#39;s; more than I can list in this blog. Needless to say, they rock and so do our partners. I can&#39;t wait to see where our app innovation goes from here. </p>
<p>And a massive shout out to some of the ISV&#39;s who have been here since the beginning:</p>
