<p>What wouldn’t you give for less tedium, less custom scripting and coding, less swivel chair, and easier communication between the security and IT teams? Luckily, we aren’t demanding anything from you but a download or two from the ServiceNow app store. There, you’ll find the latest version of Security Incident Response, and while it is now available for New York, many of the features work with the Madrid release, so there’s no need to wait for a platform upgrade!</p>
<p>There are many updates and enhancements. You can download it all with <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/product/07879be8db44fb004bd8596e5e9619a8" rel="nofollow">Opt-in</a> on the store or download them individually. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Security Operations Efficiency Dashboard: </strong>This new visualization helps monitor analyst and team performance using proven metrics.
