<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Virtual Agent: People&#39;s Preference For Engaging Experiences</strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">ServiceNow’s HR Service Delivery gives employees the experiences they deserve. Our goal is to eliminate frustration and improve employee satisfaction with efficient, intelligent services, while also boosting productivity among service delivery professionals. New with the New York release, our Virtual Agent for HR is now enabled with <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/administer/virtual-agent/concept/va-NLU.html" rel="nofollow">Natural Language Understanding (NLU)</a>. NLU allows for better employee experiences in the same very client interface when you were first introduced to Virtual Agent with the London release. As you read on, you’ll learn about our many Virtual Agent topics available out of the box, and how to optimize the benefits of automating HR communications.</p>

<p class="ng-scope"><strong>2020 Defines The Era Of Frictionless Experiences</strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">What defines a frictionless experience? Until recently, this has occurred almost exclusively outside the workplace - using Yelp reviews to locate a new restaurant in your area, booking your reservation using OpenTable, taking Lyft to avoid parking shortages, and using Venmo to split the tab - all rounds out to be what most would define as a seamless, frictionless experience. Now let&#39;s imagine what a frictionless experience looks like in the workplace. For many, the experience is disjointed at best, and often leverages traditional modals such as phone and email. A paycheck error submitted through email can sometimes take weeks to resolve at the current velocity. Aggregate this across the organization, and the amount of incoming employee requests can be downright exhaustive.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">The friction from the employee&#39;s desire for a faster resolution, plus the friction from the service delivery professional&#39;s inundation with repetitive requests, can quickly become greater that the sum of its parts. Couple this with the rise of instant information available at a moment’s notice, and you’ve got a workforce that demands answers quickly. To boot, the workplace houses as many as 5 distinct generations of employees, all with ideas of their own on what great service looks like. <strong>The goal, then, is to attenuate the sum of the parts by leveraging Virtual Agent to rectify the gap between urgent requests and mounting backlog with intelligent, in-the-moment solutions.</strong> </p>
<p class="ng-scope">Automating communications downstream from the organization to the employee has increasingly become popular to promote these frictionless, beautiful experiences. Words are not misinterpreted, employees have a place to review and share the material, and digital natives tend to prefer text-based content to traditional conversational settings. Requests that used to take days, and sometimes weeks, to resolve can now be done on-demand with Virtual Agent, with a few taps and swipes from a mobile device. As information must also funnel upstream to the organization in the form of requests, Virtual Agent supports an omnichannel schema for employees to communicate within their preferred spaces - text, email, mobile, Slack, MS Teams, or browser.</p>
<p class="ng-scope"> </p>
<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Hello, My Name Is _______. How Can I Help You?</strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">Virtual Agent is key to helping organizations metamorphose their digital people strategy. Transmuting expectations and redefining outdated structures, which includes a fresh outlook on what comprises frictionless experiences in the workplace, is a logical first step in the process. ServiceNow’s Virtual Agent NLU delivers a smooth experience that understands the employee’s intention by providing them with accurate help and guidance when they need it most. To help our HR customers get started, we offer a total of nine (9) <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-hr-service-delivery/page/product/human-resources/concept/hr-virtual-agent-conversations.html" rel="nofollow">out of the box topics</a> that span the most common employee requests:</p>
<ul class="ng-scope"><li>General HR Inquiry</li><li>Request for Leave</li><li>Pay Discrepancy</li><li>Update Address</li><li>Update Phone</li><li>Update Email</li><li>Update Emergency Contact</li><li>Add Emergency Contact</li><li>Delete Emergency Contact</li></ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Additional Virtual Agent Benefits That Are Often Overlooked</strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">Now that you are familiar with how ServiceNow’s Virtual Agent supports employees and service delivery professionals, you might still need compelling evidence beyond product deliverables. Virtual Agents can also boost intrinsic elements paramount to building a corporate culture reflective of more modern, digital progression.</p>
<p class="ng-scope" style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Assimilate new employees.</strong> Onboarding new employees has its own challenges; however, Virtual Agent can influence new hire decision making when comes to selecting the ‘right offer.’ Having Virtual Agent as a preferred method for new hires to engage with the organization can be an attractive cultural trait for those seeking modern workplaces. Engaging with the Virtual Agent throughout the onboarding process helps reinforce this investment in the dynamic experiences new hires expect, and as a bonus, secures their decision should a competing offer spark their interest at the last minute.</p>
<p class="ng-scope" style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Emphasize your culture.</strong> If you’ve ever been asked ‘what’s your brand’ or ‘what type of experience do you expect to provide employees,’ you know there are many facets to this question. Organizations increasingly recognize the need for an omnipresent communications channel, and the Virtual Agent fits that role. As such, organizations will commonly name their Virtual Agent – Arica, Alex, Ask – in the spirit of promoting the Virtual Agent as a valued member of People Services. For more information on how you can personalize the Virtual Agent, <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/administer/virtual-agent/task/set-up-virtual-agent-branding.html" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</p>
<p class="ng-scope" style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Feed-forward on employee sentiment.</strong> Following a Virtual Agent engagement, feed-forward (or feedback) can be direct or subtle. <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-hr-service-delivery/page/product/human-resources/concept/c_HRSurveysIst.html" rel="nofollow">Survey capabilities</a> are often used to collect feed-forward on whether the employee found an experience to be helpful. Direct results are collected, tracked, and analyzed to drive decisions on iterating on the desired experience. Subtle feedback, however, is native to Virtual Agent so that organizations can determine which questions could not be answered, how did a user ask for something, or whether the conversation resulted in a case. With NLU, organizations interpret this intelligence to drive actionable outcomes aimed at improving the current experience or addressing experience gaps. Based on these learnings, organizations can then tune the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/administer/natural-language-understanding/task/test-train-nlu-model.html" rel="nofollow">NLU model</a> to better deliver correct responses, as well as include additional topics needed to address learned inquiries.</p>
