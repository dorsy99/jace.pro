<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Thanks to all who could make the SNUG Meeting &#64; Ahold last week. We hope you all enjoyed the season. Feedback received so far has been positive with respect to the content of the meeting. We will start sharing the materials this week in this blog as well as next steps for the actions raised during the meeting.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Bamidele &amp; Cor.</p>
