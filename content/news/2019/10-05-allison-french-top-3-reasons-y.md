<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">It’s often said that the best communication isn’t just a one-way push of information from an organization to employees. Employee Forums, a feature of the Employee Service Center, provides a place for employees to discuss the topics they’re interested in, ask questions, and help their colleagues with questions—all while enhancing the employee service experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Employee Forums enhance the employee service experience by providing resources and guidance during service-related milestones. For example, a newly promoted manager might be added to a Manager forum, where they can access tips on how to manage people and how to keep their team engaged and on-track.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Reason #1: Gain organic insight into what’s important to employees</strong> <br />Employee Forums provide a way for service center organizations to truly understand what’s important to employees and collect feedback. In a global research study conducted by ServiceNow, we found that 61% of employees rated their employers poorly based on their experience when they took a leave of absence. Let’s consider a situation where an employee returns from parental leave and would like to share insight into their experience on returning to work. In this situation, an Employee Forum could be a great avenue for employees to share and exchange advice on how to juggle meeting times with daycare drop-off, the pros and cons of meal prep, and tips on how to initiate and return from leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Reason #2: Deflect cases and identify opportunities</span></strong><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">In addition to helping leaders understand what’s important and relevant to employees, Employee Forums content can:</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Be included in search results to drive case deflection</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Provide ideas for possible knowledge articles</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Provide ideas for possible campaigns to drive action and/or case deflection</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Provide insights into potential HR Service Catalog changes</span><br /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Employee Forums content can be configured to display in the Employee Service Center search results, as seen above. Forums content is marked with a conversation icon by default.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Reason #3: Give your employee groups a space to collaborate</span></strong><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Employee Forums can provide a place for employee groups—such as resource, interest, or diversity groups—to collaborate. Employee Forums can also provide an avenue for leaders to share updates. Example forums could be created for:</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• New Hires</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Expats</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Parents</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Chicago-Based Employees </span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Volunteering Opportunities &amp; Tips</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Leadership Updates</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Disabilities Awareness Resource Group</span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">• Women in Technology Resource Group</span></p>
