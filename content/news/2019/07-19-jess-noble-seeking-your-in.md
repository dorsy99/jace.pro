<p>ServiceNow will be launching a role-based recognition program this fall; the program is focused on your individual professional development (learning, growth &amp; success), and we’re looking for your input!</p>
<p>The feedback from this <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/5120658/Now-Creators-Naming-Lexicon" rel="nofollow">survey</a> will be used to ensure we are making great decisions related to this program’s lexicon. Much like you can achieve <strong><u>MVP</u></strong> in Community or <strong><u>Master</u></strong> Certified Architect designations in Now Learning, we’re finalizing additional terms for new designations, and we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Would you provide your input by taking this brief </strong><strong><a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/5120658/Now-Creators-Naming-Lexicon" rel="nofollow">survey</a></strong><strong>?</strong>  If you have questions, comment below.</p>
