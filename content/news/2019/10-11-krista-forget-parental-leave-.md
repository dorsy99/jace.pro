<p>One of the questions we hear most from customers who are looking to start using ServiceNow is, &#34;where do I start?&#34;  In my conversations with customers, a common ask is for more out-of-box configurations and content that gives a perspective on what&#39;s possible in ServiceNow. Customers know their business, but they want guidance on how to layer it into the tools we provide.</p>
<p>To help customers achieve their goals of delivering a next-generation employee experience and accelerate their time-to-value on our platform, I&#39;m very excited to share a new part of our content strategy: Employee Journeys.</p>
<p>Employee Journeys are packaged content and configurations that can serve as a blue-print for planning your process in ServiceNow. They focus on a particular use case, such as material moments like Parental Leave of Absence, Internal Mobility or Onboarding and can be edited to suit your organization&#39;s unique needs - <strong>entirely out of the box!</strong></p>
<p>In our New York release, we&#39;ve delivered an Employee Journey for Parental Leave of Absence. This guides the employee through the process of taking time off to add a child to their family and coordinates activities required of them, their manager, and the HR team.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve gained a wealth of insights from customer feedback, industry expert feedback, user research, and market data to create a best practice template that infuses employee empathy and engagement while making sure it incorporates the most common steps most organizations follow for coordinating this process. </p>

<h3>Using the Parental Leave Employee Journey</h3>
<p>The Parental Leave Employee Journey is installed via the &#34;Human Resources Scoped App: Employee Journeys - Parental Leave of Absence&#34; Plug-in.</p>
<p>Once the plug-in is activated, the Parental Leave Guide will be available to employees. The HR case can be triggered a few different ways: a self-service catalog request in the Employee Service Center or by an agent in the platform UI. Both of these are pre-configured as part of the plug-in. Additionally, if you&#39;ve set up an integration with another HR system, you may choose to set up a trigger for the case from a request submitted in that system. Creating the case also captures some basic info about the employee&#39;s leave of absence, which triggers the campaign for the employee.</p>
<p>Depending on your organization&#39;s needs, there may be edits to the Employee Journey that you choose to make during implementation. Because this is configured using entirely out of box functionality, you can add, remove, or modify any of it to fit your requirements.</p>
