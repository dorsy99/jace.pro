<p>Weaving intelligence into the work you do every day has always been a core part of Performance Analytics, so it shouldn’t be a surprise to see that concept as an overarching theme for the Madrid release at ServiceNow. With Madrid, we’ve made it easier than ever to analyze, compare, slice, and predict results through Analytics Hub. We’re also providing even more out-of-the-box solutions—content packs full of finely-tuned dashboards and KPIs— that let your IT, customer service, and HR service delivery teams immediately start focusing on their performance.</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of the Performance Analytics highlights and enhancements you’ll find in Madrid.</p>
<h3>Analytics Hub</h3>
<p>The most exciting part of the Madrid release for Performance Analytics is the introduction of <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/performance-analytics/concept/c_UsePerformanceAnalyticsScorecards.html" rel="nofollow">Analytics Hub</a>—an immersive studio for assessing, comparing, and predicting your organizational performance. Some of you may have used Analytics Hub while it was available through the Limited Release program during the London release, but we are rolling this change out to all customers starting with Madrid. Analytics Hub replaces the older Detailed Scorecard while the new name reflects the refreshed look and capabilities we continue to add.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>We’ve made a number of practical updates that make Analytics Hub an even better experience for ServiceNow process owners, business analysts, and administrators:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The timeline slider has moved to the upper-right corner so you can easily see and adjust the date range you’re viewing. Commonly calculated statistics like count, sum, and average for the selected range are also available in a more prominent and obvious location right below the timeline.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The previously separate Breakdowns tab has been moved to the main Overview tab within a new Breakdowns panel. This allows you to slice any part of the indicator’s score and follow breakdown relationships without switching screens or losing the selected date range.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Many settings like forecasts, confidence bands, and comments have been moved directly to the toolbar for easier access. We’ve also added new toolbar actions for creating <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-it-service-management/page/product/continual-improvement-management/concept/get-started-cim.html" rel="nofollow">continual improvement management initiatives</a> and viewing year-over-year, delta change, or percentage change charts.</li></ul>
<h3>New content packs</h3>
<p>Our solutions team that produces out-of-the-box dashboard and KPI content has been hard at work, adding and refreshing over 20 content packs for this release!</p>

<p>There are too many changes to cover here because they span almost every single ServiceNow product, but here are some of the highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Vulnerability response and remediation dashboards for <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-security-management/page/use/dashboards/application-content-packs/vulnerability-response-content-pack.html" rel="nofollow">Security Operations</a> give managers and stakeholders an end-to-end view of how their teams are responding to potential threats. Risk-based scoring visualizations help everyone focus their attention on the most important vulnerabilities to resolve.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-hr-service-delivery/page/use/application-content-packs/concept/content-automation-pa.html" rel="nofollow">Content and campaign analytics</a> allow HR service delivery teams to determine how portals are being used, which campaign content has the most interactions, and if your campaigns are driving the intended action such as completing open enrollment.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/use/dashboards/application-content-packs/virtual-agent-dashboard.html" rel="nofollow">Virtual Agent dashboard</a> gives stakeholders a view of chatbot adoption by highlighting how many users are starting conversations, which conversation topics are being used, and how interactions through each channel—web, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Facebook Workplace—are trending over time.</li></ul>
<ul><li>IT Asset Management delivers visibility into the spend, utilization, and compliance of your SAP, <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-software-asset-management/page/product/software-asset-management2/concept/sam-saas-subscription-dash.html" rel="nofollow">Office 365, and Adobe cloud subscriptions</a>.</li></ul>
<p>We’re looking forward to getting these enhancements into your hands and  hearing your feedback, so start planning those Madrid upgrades today!</p>
