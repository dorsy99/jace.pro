<p class="p1">Hey everyone, I posted <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;48fd7275db62f30423f4a345ca96192e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a brief blog with a link to a sign-up survey</a> in the general area and want to share it here for cross coverage. The short version is ServiceNow is launching a new learning platform and we’d like to have folks from the community create “beyond the beginner” content on the platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Check out the post if this sounds interesting. We’ll post updates there as more details come available.</p>
