<p><strong>How does openapi compare to json schema? is it a similar purpose and does it have more inertia?</strong> -- Raymond Ferguson<br /> OpenAPI has been around for a while (formerly known as Swagger - https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/). It&#39;s used to define the APIs. JSON is typically used to define the request/response payload format. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="01274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96199a"> </div>
<p><strong>In VA what is reusable conversation blocks?</strong> -- Brent Kimsey<br /> You can define blocks of your conversation (e.g. sets of questions or actions to perform) that can be reused across topics. Sorry if this wasn&#39;t clear in the video. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="01274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619a5"> </div>
<p><strong>Is Remote Tables just for displaying data or can you retrieve a report from an EDW site for example?</strong> -- James Higgins<br /> Yes, It allows you to retrieve and display information as if it were in a table, but it&#39;s not actually stored in the database. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="05274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961983"> </div>

<p><strong>is IDR a re-branding of eBonding? Does it require Integration Hub?</strong> -- Erik Ohlin<br /> IDR is a simple configuration way to set up data replication between ServiceNow instances.

<div id="09274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961980"> </div>
<p><strong>If there is a child task created from the parent task through flow designer Action , Is the parent task field gets auto populated in the child task form</strong> -- Abakas Sahoo<br /> By default, the tasks are separate records. If you want data shared between them then you would have to define that as part of your flow. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="09274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96199f"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we define email client templates that include attachments?</strong> -- John Feist<br /> Not at this point. Great idea. I recommend you submit an enhancement request. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Has there been any improvements made to the VMWare vRA/vRO plug in? I understand there have been challenges around this for our auto-server provisioning.

Sorry we don&#39;t have any information around ITOM. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="0d274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96199c"> </div>
<p><strong>Do you intend to integrate Virtual Agent with Flowdock or is that capability already available?</strong> -- Tracy Larson<br /> I&#39;m not sure what Flowdock is. Do you mean Flow Designer? -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Does QUick API timeouts consume space in the API queue or are they held elsewhere?</strong> -- Steve Cornett<br /> I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand the question entirely. What is the &#34;space in the API queue&#34; you are referring to? -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

Instead, you can add a property that lets you create applications in the global scope.&#34; -- Max Pham<br /><br /></p>
<div id="3c274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96197d"> </div>
<p><strong>Dynamic Input... can that be utilized for reporting?</strong> -- malaya maithani<br /> At this point it&#39;s part of Flow Designer and IntegrationHub used to manage complex (JSON) objects. If you feel it would be helpful in reporting, I invite you to open an enhancement request. Our product managers DO listen. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="41274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961988"> </div>
<p><strong>Does ATF still require a dedicated computer with active user session?</strong> -- Marc Clasby<br /> You need a client set up somewhere so it can run the tests. This could be a farm of different operating systems and browsers, or it could be someone&#39;s laptop. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="45274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961985"> </div>

<p><strong>Is excel spreadsheet looked upon as a &#34;remote table&#34;?</strong> -- John Wiese<br /> Not at this point unless you have some way to do a REST API to a Sharepoint site containing the Excel sheet. An XLSX file sitting on your laptop hard drive is not accessible from the instance. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="49274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961982"> </div>
<p><strong>is there a limit for how many times it retries</strong> -- Vyjayanth Uttanoor<br /> If you are referring to the retry policy, that&#39;s configurable by you in the policy record. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="4d274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96197f"> </div>
<p><strong>Any good documentation on in-line scripts?</strong> -- Matt Brusco<br /> https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/concept/inline-scripts.html -- Max Pham<br /><br /></p>
<div id="4d274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96198a"> </div>

<p><strong>Are scripted inbound email actions able to manage inline vs attached attachments? Use case - we want to get rid of signature inline attachments.</strong> -- Kerri Gibson-Tutt<br /> Scripted inbound email actions do not discern the content-disposition like Flow Designer does as far as I know. If I recall, you can tell it to disregard attachments below a certain file size (e.g. 2K) as many signature icons are small and most attachments are not. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="5d274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619b2"> </div>
<p><strong>Did we get any improvements when it comes to integration with third party services?</strong> -- Karimuddin Mohammed<br /> Yes. IntegrationHub has many improvements and new spokes are being released each month -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="70274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96197d"> </div>
<p><strong>Are there any alternative training for Flow Designer... I find the online training module to be incomplete and not easy to transcribe into my own needs.</strong> -- Kenneth SHAW<br /> https://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/flow-designer-fundamentals.html Also have you looked our labs from Knowledge 19: https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/event/knowledge18/LAB1009/knowledge_18_LAB1009_lab_21__use_flow_designer_to_set_up_the_integration Quite a few have Flow Designer workshops. ALso there is communities, etc. -- Max Pham<br /><br /></p>
<div id="78270b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961976"> </div>
<p><strong>Hello everyone!</strong> -- Sam Salameh<br /> Hello! -- Max Pham<br /><br /></p>

<div id="85274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961987"> </div>
<p><strong>How do get our hands into this out-of-band releases for Integration spokes? Is there a release plan for what&#39;s been release and what&#39;s coming?</strong> -- Christianne Souknary<br /> The releases will be available in the Store. Just like apps on your phone from the App Store. you can install at any time. Not sure there is a release plan. -- Kreg Steppe<br /><br /></p>
<div id="89274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961984"> </div>
<p><strong>Inbound Email Flow Trigger - can you set field values from the email body? For example, if the body of the email contains a line of Foo:bar, you can access the value of Foo by doing email.body.foo</strong> -- Miguel Calderon<br /> No parsing is available on the body insofar as I&#39;m aware, but it wouldn&#39;t take much to build an action to do something like that. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="89274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619a3"> </div>

<p><strong>In near future, is there a possibility to retire Workflows and go with just Flow Designer?</strong> -- Ramesh Babu Elagandula<br /> Workflows will continue to be available for quite some time yet. We are not removing them from the system, we just aren&#39;t adding any new features or fixing any (non-sev1) bugs. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="8d274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96198c"> </div>
<p><strong>Is virtual agent integrated with MS Teams?</strong> -- Jarrod Puleo<br /> Yes, you can access VA through MS-Teams. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/administer/virtual-agent/task/install-va-integrations.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="8d274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619a0"> </div>
<p><strong>Does IDR have any additional costs?</strong> -- Mike Morales<br /> https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-servicenow-platform/page/administer/instance-data-replication/task/request-instance-data-replication.html#request-instance-data-replication I would contact your ServiceNow Account Manager to see if you&#39;re already licensed for it. -- Max Pham<br /><br /></p>
<div id="9d274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619b4"> </div>
<p><strong>Will there be Reporting fuctionality on Dashboards?</strong> -- Kristian Campbell<br /> I&#39;m not sure I understand your question. Perhaps you can clarify in the comments below. Dashboards are made up of separate individual reports, so yes, dashboards are reporting functionality. Let me know if I am misunderstanding. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b0274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96197f"> </div>

<p><strong>Are there going to be micro-certifications / training&#39;s available for Now Mobile?</strong> -- Alle Amos<br /> I haven&#39;t heard, but it would make sense since it is a specialty development skill (in my mind anyway.) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b4274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96197c"> </div>
<p><strong>Will you be giving examples of the complex objects using arrays?</strong> -- hgh hh<br /> https://developer.servicenow.com/blog.do?p&#61;/post/ny_flow_designer_2/ -- Max Pham<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b8270b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961978"> </div>
<p><strong>Dashboard Reporting: Currently, I am only able to schedule individual reports out of ServiceNow. Will New York offer the ability to schedule/email dashboards as an Out Of The Box feature in ServiceNow?</strong> -- Kristian Campbell<br /> I haven&#39;t heard of any plans for publishing an entire dashboard. I can see several challenges in doing that (e.g. interactive dashboards, how to display it in a PDF or printable format (esp when scrolling may be involved in a widget.) That doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t happen, just that it doesn&#39;t exist today. If you feel strongly about the idea, I invite you to submit an enhancement request. Our product managers DO listen. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b8274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961979"> </div>
<p><strong>Does the Inbound email trigger handle HTML tags, when the email is sent in HTML only?</strong> -- Stan Swartwood<br /> It appears to. I was doing a test with a simple 1-line email and although the body had HTML tags, it was parsed as if it didn&#39;t. Could have just been my simple example, but I invite you to do some testing on your own. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="bc274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961976"> </div>
<p><strong>Can conditional encoded queries be used in the &#34;Inline Scripts&#34;?</strong> -- Hector LaPrade<br /> Yes. You can. -- Kreg Steppe<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c1274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961981"> </div>
<p><strong>For the JSON Object type input variables - is there any limit of the levels we can have the data (label: value pair) buried down under? Can we have a combo of array and objects?</strong> -- Hitesh Patel<br /> I haven&#39;t found a depth limit yet (after four or five) and yes, arrays are supported. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c1274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96198c"> </div>
<p><strong>By Any chance Can ServiceNow expose the Machine Learning Algorithms used for Intelligent Apps</strong> -- Karthick Nagarajan<br /> They are not available at this time. I don&#39;t know if they are considered intellectual property, patented or what. I recommend you ask your account team or customer support. Please let us know what you find. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c1274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619a0"> </div>
<p><strong>Is there a way to enable easy Import and make it accessible via Service Portal ,as well as allow non-admins to use Easy Import functionality?</strong> -- Jonas Richard<br /> I don&#39;t see Easy import making its way to Service Portal lists as a standard feature. It&#39;s not something you normally want an &#34;end user&#34; doing. You can grant one of the import roles (import_admin I believe) to a user to give them easy import capabilities. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c5274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961989"> </div>
<p><strong>I&#39;m on an integration project where i need to convert data from xml into EDI/Text format - and push this message as an MQ message to a third party.. SO need a translation engine and tool to push this messge. possible?</strong> -- Vikram Patil<br /> That would require custom development. We don&#39;t have anything like that out of the box as of New York. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c5274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf96199d"> </div>
<p><strong>with some of the changes in madrid around custom tables and licensing, is there tooling in NY that makes inventory &amp; controls of custom table sprawl easier to manage?</strong> -- Steve Cornett<br /> For licensing questions, I recommend speaking to your account team. That being said, ask about usage analytics. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-platform-administration/page/administer/subscription-management/concept/usage-analytics-module-subscription.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c9274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf961986"> </div>
<p><strong>Is there one for SharePoint?</strong> -- Marisol Tomey<br /> I believe so. http://bit.ly/2ZeiL5m -- Kreg Steppe<br /><br /></p>

<div id="cd274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619a2"> </div>
<p><strong>Is IDR bi-directional, e.g. can it replace ebonding?</strong> -- John Feist<br /> I see one restriction is that you cannot use IDR across instances owned by separate companies, which eliminates one of the primary use cases for ebonding. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>
<div id="d1274b6fdb57330083bd7646bf9619b4"> </div>
<p><strong>I am getting mixed responses on Instance Data Replication.

<p><strong>When flows stop processing, does that also bypass the scripted inbound actions??</strong> -- Steve Hill<br /> Yes. When your notification triggered flow stops the processing, it says &#34;I&#39;m done, nobody else needs to be concerned about this message&#34; and scripts are not going to be processed either. If it didn&#39;t, then you could have conflicts/errors with flows and scripts trying to process the same message. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
