<p>DevOps has become a core part of the digital transformation initiatives for most organizations. It&#39;s impacting engineering and operations teams and has the opportunity to help both teams make significant improvements in productivity as they strive to deliver new innovations.</p>
<p>For ServiceNow customers, a key initial task is integrating the rapidly-iterating DevOps continuous integration and continuous delivery processes (CI/CD) with the risk-avoidance of change management. How are you involved in DevOps in your organization?</p>
