<p><strong>Can you update Automated tests?</strong> -- Karen Guerra<br /> Yes, of course! That&#39;s essential for when you create tests for your business functionality as your business evolves. For &#34;quick start&#34; tests, you can create a copy of those tests and tailor them for your particular implementation. It&#39;s best practice to make sure you keep your ATF tests up to date as your instance evolves. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Are we able to create tests for the CSM portal using ATF?</strong> -- David Dietrich<br /> Try using the Automated Test Framework &gt; Manual Page Inspector to open the CSM portal page and interact with it. In Madrid it appears the CSM Portal framebusts the test runner frame so it will not be possible to run tests against it. Submit an incident requesting that the CSM team address this. -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="1d2107a8db837b0083bd7646bf96190c"> </div>
<p><strong>Isn&#39;t that what * does? I guess I&#39;m misunderstanding the difference</strong> -- Michael White<br /> * doesn&#39;t show any records unless you suffix it (e.g. *ga).

<p><strong>I asked the mobile testing question to the former CEO of Sky Giraffe (can&#39;t remember his name) and he told me if used as designed ATF is not needed for mobile because they own the inner workings and they make sure it is working as designed. Not sure how ATF would be used, but maybe there is a way. Glad they are considering.</strong> -- Jay Freise<br /> Thank you for your comment -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>
<div id="212107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961966"> </div>
<p><strong>Will you ever be able to impersonate user in an ATF, test runner currently logs you out of current session?</strong> -- Stan Haag<br /> please create an incident if an ATF test is logging you out of your instance during a test. Make sure your user has roles and is active -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="212107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961969"> </div>
<p><strong>Thank you Stacey!</strong> -- John Gubatayao<br /> Thank you, John! -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Are the test still valid to export from Developer.servicenow.com to our instance?</strong> -- Steve Crocker<br /> you&#39;ll find varying degrees of success exporting and importing data between two unrelated instances. Tests are metadata, and adhere to the instance&#39;s configuration and database. If you import a test and notice that data is missing, you can still update the test with data available to your instance -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="252107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961968"> </div>

<div id="292107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961962"> </div>
<p><strong>is there a documenttaion on what is not testable through ATF?</strong> -- Chetan Gandhi<br /> Yes, on docs.servicenow.com there is a (Madrid and up) page &#34;Custom UI test steps&#34; that lists testable and untestable ui components -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="292107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961964"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we pass variable from one test case to other within a test suit? ideally within a test case INC number can be passed from one step to other but its not allowing to relate all test cases within a suit. Or is my understanding incorrect</strong> -- Pavan Amarala<br /> Tests cannot share data. All data created or modifiied during a test is rolled back to its original state at the end of each test. We are aware of the interest to support calling tests within other tests, but please submit an enhancement request to have your scenario reviewed -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2d2107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961963"> </div>
<p><strong>In Custom UI - If the clickable component have same details and name, How can we know which component needs to be clicked ?</strong> -- Manoj Soundararajan<br /> The easiest way to find your component is to add an &#39;id&#39; attribute to the HTML element. Then you can search for that ID when building the step -- Matt Coleman<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2d2107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961966"> </div>
<p><strong>If you create a record at the beginning of a test do all of the tests in that suite use that record?</strong> -- Steven Bogart<br /> Data is rolled back after each test execution, so a record created by one test in a suite cannot be used by the other tests in the suite -- Matt Coleman<br /><br /></p>
<div id="512107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961910"> </div>
<p><strong>Have you experienced or seen customers ATF do NOT roll back properly?</strong> -- Kimberley Sanders<br /> No. I have not heard of that. If you are having issues with that behavior, you may want to reach out to customer support. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="512107a8db837b0083bd7646bf96194b"> </div>
<p><strong>Currently the test results go into a log - are there plans to be able to display via a dashboard</strong> -- Jerry Groesser<br /> Per Shrity, you can use the standard reporting and dashboarding functionality to create a dashboard. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>
<div id="512107a8db837b0083bd7646bf96194e"> </div>
<p><strong>HI, for the regular incident, problem forms with multiple UI action etc, which testing approach is preferred? [Should we use this UI testing approach?]</strong> -- Balaji Jaganathan<br /> You can use the Form category of steps to interact with standard platform forms. There are some cases like the Change table&#39;s form interceptor that will require a Custom UI step to click the interceptor links. -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="512107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961951"> </div>
<p><strong>How does the option for Custom UI shows up in the Add Test Step popup?</strong> -- Sankalp Joshi<br /> There is a new &#39;Custom UI&#39; category in the Add Test Step modal that contains all the Custom UI steps -- Matt Coleman<br /><br /></p>
<div id="552107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961950"> </div>
<p><strong>I missed this due to my connection, but how is page inspector different to steering by the DOM? If you have good stable IDs for objects, upgrades shouldn&#39;t affect a POM approach.</strong> -- Alistair Driver<br /> The page inspector shows how the ATF will interact with a page during test execution. It enables a developer to confirm their page is testable outside of writing an ATF test. Having IDs on your testable elements is recommended -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="592107a8db837b0083bd7646bf96194c"> </div>
<p><strong>would this work on a modal page like the risk survey?</strong> -- Chris Bui<br /> Yes you can use Custom UI steps to interact with modals -- Matt Coleman<br /><br /></p>
<div id="592107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961952"> </div>
<p><strong>Is there a possibility the parameters will be able to read directly from existing tables (i.e., won&#39;t have to create a choice list)?</strong> -- Susan Williams<br /> yes parameters are dictionary records, and can be defined as references to tables -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="5d2107a8db837b0083bd7646bf96190a"> </div>

<div id="612107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961957"> </div>
<p><strong>Are these examples for this Maually adding step by step available somewhere?</strong> -- Kimberley Sanders<br /> If you&#39;re referring to adding steps from the Custom UI step category, check out docs.servicenow,com (Madrid and up), page &#34;Create a custom UI test&#34;. For just adding any steps to a test there is an eLearning Series &#34;Automated Test Framework (ATF) Fundamentals (ID: ES-SN-ATFF-WBT, Version: 1)&#34;. Create an incident if you&#39;re unable to find it -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>what is the capacity for interacting with UI pages and Client side alerts and/or confirm?</strong> -- Mark Johnson<br /> You can use Custom UI steps to interact with UI pages. Browser-level alerts &amp; confirms (ex. window.alert(&#39;hi&#39;), window.confirm(&#39;hi&#39;)) are automatically captured and recorded in the Test Log table, which is a related list on a Test Result form -- Matt Coleman<br /><br /></p>
<div id="652107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961959"> </div>
<p><strong>will the ability to turn off rollback be available in future?</strong> -- David Pax<br /> we currently do not recommend disabling rollback because it affects the ability to repeat execution of tests.

This way standard repeatable steps could be created once and then combined as needed to create new tests along with new steps.</strong> -- Matt Spangler<br /> We are looking into supporting this, but there is no specific release planned yet. -- Matt Coleman<br /><br /></p>
<div id="692107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961961"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we test UI actions under related list using custom UI?</strong> -- Kushal Dangare<br /> related list support is on the roadmap but not available to date -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6d2107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961954"> </div>
<p><strong>Will ATF have variables that can be used across Test Sets? for example, I create a variable called &#34;my_color&#34; and set it to &#34;blue&#34; then in the test set, I can set the Test Run data Parameter to the variable. Allows me to use the same value across multiple test set without having to enter it in every test set.</strong> -- James Kailukaitis<br /> Parameter Definitions can be shared between tests, but Test Run Data Sets are only available to the test on which it&#39;s defined. -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6d2107a8db837b0083bd7646bf961957"> </div>
<p><strong>If records are created from ATF, can we easily track what records are created so they can be removed post testing? Or removed automatically at end of testing...thinking about production upgrade testing...</strong> -- Ashley Myers<br /> They should be removed automatically. However, there are some limitations regarding cleanup. See details here: https://docs.servicenow.com/search?q&#61;Tables excluded from rollback after running an automated test &amp;labels&#61;2 -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>When personnel changes at our company I may need to change the Impersonate step and approvers with the new users names. This is in our service portal ATF test. I plan on making a table with catalog item, workflow catalog step, assignment group and assigned user. Then in the test get the assigned user from the table given the catalog item and catalog step. To help propagate the table what would the script look like where I can get the assignment group from a published workflow for a catalog item?</strong> -- Edward Parker<br /> You may benefit from the parameterized tests that Shrity will show in this video. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>or can they be saved off, so cloning over an instance will not erace them</strong> -- Howard Richter<br /> Howard, I would encourage you to deploy these through your instance stack so they exist on your production environment, even though you would not run them on prod. That way, they will be included on any clones back down to non-prods. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Any tips/suggestions on how to pick the correct object. Ex. On incident when looking to hit save button, it shows 6 save buttons. Not sure on what to pick.</strong> -- Bhaskar TELKALA<br /> The best way to find the right button to click is to search by sys_id. ex. If you right click the Save button on an incident form you can hit &#39;Edit UI Action&#39; and then right click the header to copy the sys_id of that UI action. Then when you are building your Click a UI step, you can filter down to that sys_id -- Matt Coleman<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Do you create an update set to capture these to move to Production from test</strong> -- Steven Bogart<br /> Yes, capture tests just as you would with other development work and promote through your instance stack. Even though you wouldn&#39;t run your ATF tests in PROD, it&#39;s handy to have them there for when you clone back to refresh your stack. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Is parameters the way that ATF will now be able to test/verify dropdown lists?</strong> -- Matt Spangler<br /> Custom UI steps can identify the contents of a choice list at runtime for testing on custom ui pages (ui pages, portal pages, widgets, GlideModals), but scripted choice lists on forms and service catalog item variables are not supported in any step category. If you use scripted choice lists, we recommend changing to a dictionary/variable with defined choices for maintainability, testability, and access to the choice list security model -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>How would this work when testing domain separated applications?</strong> -- Kelly Campbell<br /> If you start your test with an Impersonation step for a user in a specific domain, the UI will render as the person in that domain and the test should execute as normal allowing you to test the custom UI as rendered for that domain / user. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>and what if the user is in multiple domains?</strong> -- Kelly Campbell<br /> A user can only exist in one domain. If you&#39;re asking about users who have visibility to see multiple domains, I don&#39;t think there is support yet to select a domain as a test step. However, if you add some more details, we can look into what you&#39;re trying to do a bit more. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to test for an expected failure (so if the test fails it is actually a success)?

<p><strong>Can we write manually custom UI field descriptions instead of learning each time?</strong> -- satya Tota<br /> You can change how a field appears in a Custom UI step by adding detail to the actual page&#39;s elements - this requires the page developer to alter the page. For example specify or change that element&#39;s attributes: aria-label, title, alt, name, id, and the text between element tags. The Custom UI step Retrieve Component feature identifies the structure of a page and its testable UI components in real time during test execution. It&#39;s able to record data that may only appear to specific users and configurations for the defined test scenario, and enables the Add Test Step interface to adjust to changing scenarios without requiring the user to manually define HTML that would otherwise be necessary to represent interacting with those fields. -- Joel Fischer<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>How to test Integrations using ATF?</strong> -- Meghna Shaw<br /> There are test steps to test outbound REST integrations. To test inbound integrations, though, typically, you would set your test to trigger the integration condition and then test the results. When testing the results, on steps like Record Query, there is a timeout setting that can give the integration time to run. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>
