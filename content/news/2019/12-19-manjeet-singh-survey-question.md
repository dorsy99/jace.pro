<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We added a new feature, Survey Question Bank, in Madrid release that aims to make survey creation much easier, much faster, and provides you a library of best practice-based re-usable questions. <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-servicenow-platform/page/administer/survey-administration/task/configure-questionbank-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Question Bank feature</a> is a library of survey categories and questions that allow you to find and add commonly asked questions by one click. The reference library of questions is written in a methodologically sound way to reduce bias and give you the most accurate answers.</span></p>

<p>Re-using questions from the survey Question Bank makes survey design fast and convenient, so you can spend more time putting feedback into action.</p>
