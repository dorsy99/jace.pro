<p><strong>What?</strong></p>
<p>ServiceNow Deskside Chats are a new video series from ServiceNow, available at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#61;PLCOmiTb5WX3pPvDYOKedpmnHmKLI75Nzo" rel="nofollow">NowSupport Youtube Channel</a>. These short ~5 minute videos are intended to introduce you to products and features, and answer common questions associated with them. As interview style in person videos, these playlists offer a easy way to consume information, especially if you&#39;re just listening on the go. ServiceNow Deskside Chats features the individuals primarily from product management who are responsible for the apps discussed during the chats. While the core hosts from each BU will stay the same, guests may also include architects and other technical consultants who have deep familiarity into a product or offering.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re new to desk side chats, take a look at the example about the Community below, with special guest Chuck Tomasi!</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by what has been well received in many other developer communities [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;gjK9OuADRps" rel="nofollow">Cisco</a> // <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;pmsock2m_ss" rel="nofollow">Fortnite</a> // <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;YUpJQl8OOBc" rel="nofollow">Sea of Thieves</a> // <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;pZ9-TLE5RVI" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>], we wanted to bring you the latest product information regarding features both new and old, directly from the source - the product managers in charge of these products and features. Our goal is to have another channel where you can familiarize yourself with not only the products, but the people behind them. We are looking to you to guide us on the content you&#39;d like to see covered, and the questions you&#39;d like to hear answered.</p>
