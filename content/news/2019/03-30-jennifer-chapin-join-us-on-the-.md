<p>For the past 12 years, ServiceNow has hosted Knowledge and gathered the best and brightest for keynotes, breakout sessions, hands-on labs, networking, and so much more. Knowledge continues to grow and this year, we will welcome 20,000 attendees to experience a gathering of people who want to take work to the next level. Because Knowledge grows year over year, there are many people who are first time attendees and the returning attendees want to know whatâ€™s in it for them.</p>
<p>Just as Knowledge improves every year, so do we. As you can see on this blog, we have created a podcast series, The Road to Knowledge, for Knowledge alumni, new attendees, employees, and everyone in between. This series is packed with information giving a behind the scenes look at the event. Listen to conversations with ServiceNow leaders, our solution and product offerings, and much more! We want you to get the most out of your Knowledge experience and this podcast is just the start.</p>
