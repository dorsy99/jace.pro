<p>In 2019, ServiceNow moved to a N-1 support model, meaning we&#39;re supporting one previous version from the current release:</p>
<p>Current is London, officially supporting Kingston, best efforts Jakarta &amp; previous, etc.</p>
<p>Need another reason to keep up to date? ServiceNow recently commissioned a study by Forrester Consulting on the benefits of staying up to date with our latest release. Forrester interviewed several customers with years of experience using ServiceNow. Check out this Study to find how customers achieved financial benefits by staying current with ServiceNow upgrades.</p>
