<div id="690e3869db183b00371478b5ae9619f4"> </div>

<div id="690e3869db183b00371478b5ae9619ff"> </div>
<p><strong>I installed the Agent app on Android... but I do not see the 3 icons at the bottom... is that expected?</strong> -- Manik Nagra<br /> The icons on the bottom are dependent on how you configure the details screen.

<p><strong>Does it integrate with Microsoft Intune MDM?</strong> -- Joseph A. Labella<br /> We allow our app to be pulled from app store using Intune, dynmically configured using app config, and managed in the Intune console.

<div id="950e3869db183b00371478b5ae9619de"> </div>

<div id="9d0e3869db183b00371478b5ae9619e0"> </div>
<p><strong>does mobile use the location ability of the device &amp; does it track users all the time?</strong> -- Virgil Prather<br /> The Agent app can take advantage of the device&#39;s location services, camera, and other native capabilities. As far as tracking, it&#39;s not tracking all the time via the app. That being said, your carrier can track you based on which towers you are using, but that&#39;s not specific to the ServiceNow mobile app. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a10e3869db183b00371478b5ae9619f9"> </div>

<p><strong>Can we configure folders and applets to a particular User group based on roles/ groups/ User criteria?</strong> -- Anurag Reddy<br /> While applets have a role assigned to them, I don&#39;t see the same for folders. They&#39;re more or less &#34;dividers&#34; on the screen to help organize the applets. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a10e7869db183b00371478b5ae961906"> </div>
<p><strong>Does the off-line sync overwrite the updates made online ?</strong> -- Karthik Narayanaswamy<br /> This depends on the business rules that are set up. For instance, if online the state changes to &#34;closed complete&#34; but when user 2 syncs the offline data and trys to change it to in progress, then that action will fail. Comments that are added use the mobile timestamp. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>So, you mean the ITSM-Change Management capabilities would be part of the end user app planned for future?</strong> -- Louis Joseph<br /> I haven&#39;t heard any word if we will be building OOB applets for change management. I recommend checking with your account team. If they don&#39;t have anything, it wouldn&#39;t preclude you from creating your own. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>thanks... so the end user will be using the same new mobile app in the future (possibly Classic will be discontinued)?</strong> -- JR Camposanto<br /> End users will have their own app in the future. You COULD set them up with Agent for now (e.g. quick approvals with a swipe for example), but the experience on the new app is targeted more to the end users than agents/fulfillers. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="ed0e7869db183b00371478b5ae961906"> </div>
<p><strong>Thanks, that helps. Another followup Q? though.. If i want to create a change - mobile application (like the one being demo&#39;ed right now), will the STUDIO pull in all Change specific attributes that we can see today on ESP Change MGmt module, to be able to build the application? Or is that something we need to code-in on Application as well, as we build it?</strong> -- Louis Joseph<br /> I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not familiar enough with ESP Change Management to answer this. I recommend reaching out to your account team for more detailed information. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>How does offline capability work ? What if 2 people start updating?</strong> -- Arun Praveen Joseph Arumainaayagam<br /> There is no specific &#34;Conflict resolution&#34; for offline. If two people are updating then the last change that is updated will be reflected. That is unless there are specific business rules, which are recommended, to fail actions/syncs if records have been updated accordingly. However, for comments and other updates the mobile uses the mobile timestamp which is recorded while offline. So comments added first will be shown first in the record. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
