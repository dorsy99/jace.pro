<p class="p3"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">The Configuration Management Database (CMDB)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">First, a little bit of background, the ServiceNow Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is a data repository made up of a series of tables that contain all the assets and services managed by a company. This information includes servers, network devices, applications, services, <span class="s2">their relationships</span>, and more.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">The CMDB is a purpose-built database explicitly designed to support Configuration Management. Configuration Management is an engineering and management discipline that seeks to ensure your products or services are built and operating by the required and desired state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">The IT Service Desk can use the CMDB during an incident management process to better understand their network users&#39; equipment and software; network managers can gain visibility into the servers, applications, and network devices on their network including the relationships between them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Leveraging proven tools and processes during a CMDB implementation helps maintain the integrity of the CMDB. One of those tools is CI Class Manager which is a central view to create or edit basic class definitions, and class settings for identification, reconciliation, and CMDB Health.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">One of those processes is the Identification and Reconciliation module which provides a centralized framework for identifying and reconciling data from different data sources. It helps maintain the integrity of the CMDB when multiple data sources such as Discovery, import sets, and third-party discovery tools populate the CMDB and create and update CI records.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">The use of multiple sources increases the risk of introducing inconsistencies through duplicate records. Identification and Reconciliation, helps you prevent duplication of CI records, reconcile CI attributes, reclassify CIs, and allows only authoritative data sources to update the CMDB.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Accurate and complete CMDB data is essential to provide enterprise-wide visibility. The most efficient way to populate the CMDB is with automated discovery tools such as ServiceNow Discovery and Service Mapping which both provide vast capabilities to discover a wide array of infrastructure, applications, and relationships, both on premise and in the cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">CMDB Administrators can further enhance the data they collect for the CMDB by integrating with third-party applications such as Microsoft SCCM, activating a ServiceNow provided integration, installing a certified integration from the ServiceNow Store.</span></p>
