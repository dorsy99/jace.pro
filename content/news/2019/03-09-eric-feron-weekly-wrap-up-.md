<p>Hello SecOps Community,</p>
<p>I hope you are all very well, wherever you are around the globe, on this glorious Friday.</p>
<p>Today is <a href="https://g.co/kgs/199EjK" rel="nofollow">International Women&#39;s Day</a>, so a very special greeting to all the ladies active on this Forum, thank you for your contributions and your interest in NOW&#39;s products. As an aside, gender equality is a cause very close to my heart and not only because I taught my daughter to ride off-road motorcycles... Ask me if you have time :) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has been a busy week here at NOW in Santa Clara, CA with the RSA conference in San Francisco, the launch of Madrid, and for me the follow up of our first video tutorial published last week, the digestion of the learnings from the Security Operations Fundamentals Class and the planning of upcoming events for you all (follow up to last week&#39;s video tutorial, deep-dives on Madrid features etc.).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_question&amp;sys_id&#61;c32c949fdba327c0b1b102d5ca9619ac" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> seems to be deemed useful and relevant, as the landing page is now close to being in the all-time top 20 most viewed (quite a achievement after only a few days being up) and the video has already been watched by over 200 people! We are off to a good start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let me take a couple of steps back and fill you in on what we are trying to do here:</p>
<p>NOW is growing at incredible speed and so are our Customers. The pace of innovation and new information is such that it is hard to absorb it all. The Community here is a fantastic &#34;filter&#34; of what is really important for you. A bit like a social network, your peers have concerns and interests similar to yours: they help (and you help them) shine the light on the signals in the middle of lots of noise. We want to encourage and facilitate this to help you succeed.</p>
<p>This Community is very healthy and a strong base to build on. Right now the answer rate and the speed at which you get answers to your questions are quite remarkable! Also the quality and frequency of the information shared with you here by NOW are second to none. If we look at this from the perspective of a knowledge supply / demand model, supply is strong. This is a great place to be!</p>
<p>However, so far, only a small proportion of our Customers take advantage of the benefits of the Community. We want to change this. A way to look at the future is to imagine that one day soon, all Security Operations users will use this Community daily as their primary source of up-to-date, quality knowledge and insights for product usage and professional development. </p>
<p>As we continue rolling out the video tutorials to help &#34;newbies&#34; implement their newly acquired Security Incident Response and Vulnerability Response suites, I would like to engage in a conversation with you all with a view to build this Forum into an increasingly useful and valuable resource, for you. This will help guide the plans we are putting together to deliver more value to all of you.</p>
<p>Imagine that we are only at the beginning of things and there are lots of ideas on the table, from possible new engagements (e.g. voting on future features to help roadmap decisions and innovation), to new Forum tools (e.g. Discussions and Polls modules), new content (e.g. confidential, Customers only previews and announcements) and a lot more. We need to prioritize and for this, we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would love to hear from you.</p>
<p> In the meantime, have a fab week end.</p>
<p>EF</p>
