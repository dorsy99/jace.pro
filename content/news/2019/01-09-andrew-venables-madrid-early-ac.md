<p>Note: <em>Do not publish/demo/promote in any way your Madrid instance to anyone who has not agreed to our program&#39;s legal terms and conditions (completed when joining the TPP).</em></p>
<p><strong>Why do we provide early access to technology partners?</strong></p>
<ol><li>In order for partners to test their apps against the Madrid release and address any bugs or changes by the time Madrid goes GA and their customers start to upgrade.</li><li>In order for partners to assess new features in Madrid, and determine which should be incorporated into their store apps.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Early Access Expectations</strong></p>
<ol><li>Partners are expected to use early access to test their apps against the Madrid release.</li><li>Partners are expected to submit their application for certification or recertification on the Madrid release once Madrid certification opens. *Failure to submit for Madrid certification may disqualify you from future early access.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Eligibility<br /></strong></p>
<p>In order to qualify for Madrid early access you must:</p>
<ol><li>Be a current Technology Partner.</li><li>Have an app currently certified on London.</li><li>Be requesting an upgrade to a single vendor instance.</li></ol>
<p><strong>How should partners be testing their apps in the Madrid release?</strong></p>
<p>You should be testing for both applications already in instances when they&#39;re upgraded and then installing the app onto a clean instance.</p>
<ol><li>Request early access for a vendor instance which already has your app installed on it.</li><li>In the newly upgraded Madrid instance run through your application test cases.</li><li>Request a zboot (instance reset) of that instance on hi.</li><li>Install your app onto the newly zbooted, clean Madrid instance and run through your functional test cases.</li></ol>
<p><em>Going through this process will test your app for both customers who are upgrading to Madrid and customers who are installing it for the first time onto Madrid.</em> </p>
