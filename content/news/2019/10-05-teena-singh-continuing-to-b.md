<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Episode 2: Continuing to build: Recent Improvements to your ability to obtain Service and Support from ServiceNow</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the month of September we completed over 35 stories of development work to improve your Service and Support experience. These improvements include securing and improving your HI login experience, a timeout warning, HI navigational improvements to enable quicker access to information and new natural language understanding virtual agent conversations to assist you with key tasks and navigation. Read more to understand specifics about what we have done and learn how you can influence our future roadmap as we proceed. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Details on Specific Improvements: </strong></span></h2>
<p>Read more below to understand the specifics of these improvements to your customer experience. Many of these improvements started as a piece of customer feedback – its great to come full circle now and be able to tell you what we have done after hearing the ideas directly from you.</p>
<h3><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>What&#39;s New Zone</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you have logged into HI in the last few weeks, you have probably seen the new banners at the top of the authenticated landing page. We call these informational banners the “What’s New” zone. The impetus behind creating this zone was to ensure that our customers were informed about what we were improving on HI and also be aware of key programs that they are eligible for. We will be evolving this space to present you with targeted information so content shown to you is relevant to you and your company when you log in. Remember to check out the smaller banners - those banners will provide tips and tricks so that you can be more productive as an Admin. Please note, we provided a minimize/maximize function on these banners so you can focus on the other details on the landing page after you have seen any informational updates.</p>

<h3>Quick access to key functions from the HI Authenticated Landing Page</h3>
<p>We have heard for a while, that you wanted quick access to key functions as soon as you log into HI. We have provided that in a modern design by updating the side Feedback tab to be a multipurpose tab where you can conveniently provide feedback, access Now Community and Create a Case. We hope this makes it a more seamless experience for you as an Admin. </p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/0d778525db1c045013b5fb2439961903.iix" /></p>
<h3>Updates to HI Login Experience</h3>
<p>We realize that HI is not the only service and support site you frequent to learn about ServiceNow and troubleshoot issues. To create a sense of consistency, we have matched the HI login page to that of other key properties that you frequent as an Admin (i.e. Now Community and ServiceNow Production Documentation).</p>
<p>Additionally, you may have noticed recently that we made a change to how you authenticate to HI. By adding Multifactor Authentication (MFA) to HI user accounts we are enhancing security for our customers. This change is happening in a phased approach that started with all ServiceNow employees and pilot customers and is now rolling out to every customer account over the next couple months. You can read more about the rationale behind this change in this informative blog post, &#34;<a href="our Multifactor Authentication %28MFA%29 Experience on the HI Service Portal" rel="nofollow">Evolving our Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Experience on the HI Service Portal</a>.&#34;</p>
<h3>Timeout warning</h3>
<p>We had customer feedback telling us how frustrating it was that there was no warning when their HI session was going to be timed out. We have now installed a timeout warning so that if you are in the middle of creating or updating a case you can simply extend your session and complete your task at hand.</p>

<h3>Natural Language Understanding Virtual Agent conversations</h3>
<p>We have recently updated the Virtual Agent on the HI Service Portal. This reimplementation includes the newly available Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities in the New York release. Give it a try! We now have a personalized greeting, the ability for you to create a case from the VA and also the ability to update your HI password. You can learn more about the 11 new conversations that we have launched in <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;8218ede5db18c8105129a851ca9619b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this blog post</a> by my colleague Howard Shaw.</p>

<h3>Universal Profile Experience on Now Community</h3>
<p>A universal profile experience was launched across multiple sites ServiceNow sites in September as a part of the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/now-creators.html" rel="nofollow">Now Creators </a>launch. Now Creators is a program and a platform where you can create a profile and track your skills and achievements with the Now platform and the ServiceNow solutions. You gain skills through predefined achievement paths, earn badges, and can share your accomplishments with others. Your achievements are stored in the Now Profile.</p>

<h3 class="ng-scope"><strong>Mobile On the Go Experience</strong></h3>
<p class="ng-scope">As a busy Admin, it&#39;s hard to keep track of all the notifications and updates from the HI Service Portal so we are launching a mobile on the go HI experience for customer service and support.  This pilot starts by leveraging our latest New York release and also leverage Orlando release updates to provide a new mobile application to enhance your customer support experience with ServiceNow. The application is built using the recently released <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/now-mobile.html" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow NowMobile studio</a> and our goal is to provide you with a mobile friendly experience to engage with ServiceNow support. <strong>If you are interested in participating in the HI Mobile Pilot, let me know.</strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope" style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/5685d9addbd0845013b5fb2439961985.iix" /></p>
<h3><strong>Idea Management</strong></h3>
<p>Got ideas? You will be able to provide them in a more formal manner starting in mid October on the Now Community.  On the new <strong>Ideas Portal</strong> you will be able to view and comment on ideas, vote on your favorites, and submit ideas of your own. The top ideas will be reviewed by ServiceNow, and we will communicate back to the community the status of those ideas. The Idea Portal will replace our existing product enhancement mechanism.  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/3a97dd25dbd4845013b5fb2439961984.iix" /></p>
<h3 class="ng-scope"><strong>Community &amp; Case integration - Close the Loop</strong></h3>
<p class="ng-scope">We have started establishing the groundwork for integrating our Community with Case Management. We understand that when you have a question on the Community you need a response. Our “Close the Loop” Community to Case feature will give you an option to create a Support Case if your question has not received any replies on the Community.  </p>
<p class="ng-scope"><em>Note: This is a phased roll-out applicable only to known customers. Known customers have the same email in HI as Community.</em></p>

<p>If you have a suggestion or would like to give us kudos for the work we have done, please <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/hisp" rel="nofollow">log into HI</a> and use the convenient Feedback button. I personally read every piece of feedback, and the positive ratings with constructive feedback are my favorite way to start the day!</p>
