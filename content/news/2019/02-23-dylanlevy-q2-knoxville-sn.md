<p>We are very excited to announce that the next <strong>Knoxville ServiceNow User Group Meeting</strong> is in the works for Q2!</p>
<p>This is a wonderful opportunity to discuss the latest ServiceNow news and updates, along with best practice discussions and opportunities for networking with your fellow service management professionals. </p>
<p>We will also be looking for a few speakers to show off a creative solution they have built in the ServiceNow platform. </p>
