<p><br /><strong>A Proven Best Practice for Getting Up and Running Sooner</strong><br />Companies invest in ServiceNow with the aim of making their world of work, work better. One of the ways we make good on that promise is to hold a workshop with your team to ensure that the implementation process gets off to a smooth start.</p>
<p>But this workshop is more than a formality. It’s a proven tactic that helps you build up the knowledge, skills, and expertise to maximize your ROI. Here’s a quick overview of why this workshop matters and what you can expect from the session.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for a live on-site session.</strong><br />Over the course of thousands of successful client engagements, we’ve learned that there’s no substitute for a face-to-face workshop held at your location. Some people question why a remote session won’t work. But a live workshop involves more than just talking and slides. It creates a dynamic that a remote session can’t replicate. Think of it this way: seeing your favorite band on a 65-inch 4K UHD TV is great. Seeing them in person is a different thing altogether.</p>
<p>An in-person workshop establishes a shared context for ongoing collaboration. It encourages the relationships that build trust. And it sets the tone for our future interactions. During these sessions, you also get the opportunity to see aspects of the product that you may have forgotten about after the sales cycle. It underscores the importance of the project and each team member’s contribution to its success. Everyone is more likely to participate and feel responsible for the success of the project and their individual value they bring.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Gathering requirements is part of the prep.</strong><br />Before the on-site workshop takes place, a ServiceNow engagement manager goes to work helping the team prepare for requirements gathering. This effort does two critical things. First, it is an education process by which everyone understands how requirements will be gathered and documented at the workshop. Second, it gets everyone on the same page by establishing shared terminology and vocabulary. Teams can waste valuable time finding common ground and this process establishes a solid foundation. <br /> <br /><strong>Governance should be on the agenda.</strong><br />One of the primary areas of focus during the workshop is to understand your governance plans. It’s an important topic because many customers either don’t have formal software governance programs or they haven’t yet included their ServiceNow solution in that program. Our experience has shown that a well-designed, well-run governance program is a key element of your future success with ServiceNow. It helps clarify what initiatives are in or out of scope. It prompts you to think holistically about your software strategy and how your current ServiceNow investment fits into your future plans. Understandably, the focus is usually on making the most of your current investment in ServiceNow. But talking through future possibilities helps maximize your return over the long haul. <br /> <br /><strong>Get the right people in the room.</strong><br />It’s an obvious step, but having the right people from your organization participate in the workshop is critically important. Despite its importance, it’s not as easy as it sounds. Getting people to commit to participation can be a challenge in this era of back-to-back meetings and overscheduling. At ServiceNow, we’ve seen the positive impact that comes from the willing participation of everyone involved. It sends the message that the project is important and worthy of the time of those involved. It’s well worth the effort to ensure that the right people are in attendance so you can streamline training and support and smooth out any bumps in the road prior to going live.</p>
<p><strong>Do a deep dive into processes.</strong> <br />A significant portion of a successful workshop is devoted to discussing your processes in detail and the way your ServiceNow solution will play a role in supporting them. Our methodology follows the tried-and-true best practices of scores of engagements. Your understanding of your own processes can be different than that of the ServiceNow team. We work to establish common ground on what elements of the process will remain, what you hope to change, and how we’ll measure and track progress using the ServiceNow Service Portal.</p>
<p><br />After the workshop, the development begins – the building of your new environment starts to take shape. It can involve everything from sprint and release planning to making sure that your system administrator has the knowledge and support needed to be their own best expert. The end of the workshop isn’t the end of the collaboration with ServiceNow. We continue to do what it takes to help you build the internal expertise you’ll need to get the most value from your investment.</p>
