<p style="text-align: left;">Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) and security are on the agenda of board of directors’ meetings for every public company. Thorough briefings and productive discussions are essential for fulfilling the board’s oversight responsibilities and managing cyber risk. However, finding the right level of detail for those discussions is always challenging for IT, Security, and Audit leaders, given the varied roles that boards have, and the diverse knowledge and experience of the directors.</p>
<p>Join ServiceNow CISO Ben de Bont and VP Andrew Wheatley as they discuss their experiences on successfully reporting about risk to the board. They will examine how they prepare for these reports, including the use of ServiceNow GRC and Security Operations to provide the appropriate level of detail for the board to understand progress and make decisions.</p>
