<p>Intelligence and ease of use are the dominate themes for the new GRC enhancements just released to the <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/search?category&#61;Governance%252C%2520Risk%2520and%2520Compliance&amp;orderby&#61;rating" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Store</a>.  Although they are earmarked for Orlando, because GRC releases through the store we are able to make them available now for those customers that have a New York instance. When the release of Orlando occurs early next year they will be tested and also comparable with Orlando.</p>
<p>The enhancements include:</p>
<ul><li>Virtual Agent chatbot for GRC</li><li>Policy Acknowledgement</li><li>Attestation consolidation</li><li>GDPR DPIA Use Case Accelerator</li><li>Risk Event enhancements - Configurable approvals, External Risk Events (ORX), PA Dashboards</li><li>SIG 2019 support</li></ul>
<p>I&#39;d like to go into a bit of detail on a few of the enhancements: Virtual Agent chatbot for GRC, Policy Acknowledgement, and Attestation consolidation.  These highlight our expanding AI/ML capabilities and the use of GRC across the enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Agent chatbot for GRC:</strong></p>
<p>Any experience that slows down work is a problem. We all hope for a similar mobile, consumerized experience from our business applications that we get from our consumer apps. Chatbots are a common consumer experience that we have brought to GRC. The GRC virtual agent chatbot is an intelligent assistant that improves the user experience of everyday employees. Users are walked through the process of making standard requests like executing a policy exception or reporting a risk event with simple prompts in plain English. New requests or conversations are easily configured. Chatbots make GRC a user friendly and seamless part of everyday work.</p>

<p><strong>Policy Acknowledgement:</strong></p>
<p>We know ensuring compliance in many organizations can be a time-consuming, error prone, and cumbersome manual process for compliance managers, employees, and business owners (in IT, Finance, HR, Security, etc.); executed in silos. This feature provides the ability to send out policies such as Acceptable IT Use, Insider Trading, Code of Conduct, and even travel and expense for review and acknowledgement by employees across the organization to meet compliance requirements. Results are tracked within the record and dashboards can be used to communicate to other levels in the organization. The acknowledgement request is generated by the policy owner or compliance manager. The Service Portal has been enhanced to include a new menu that allows employees to easily respond.</p>

<p><strong>Attestation consolidation:</strong></p>
<p>Regular attestations or risk assessments are a necessary part of managing an organization’s exposure, but it should not affect employee’s productivity or performance.  Answering a large volume of risk assessments or attestations separately can be tedious and time-consuming, and they affect every department: IT to verify change management is in place, Finance to ensure the books were closed correctly, and Sales at the end of quarter to certify no side deals were done. By grouping attestations together into either a single UI or having the ability to answering similar questions once and apply the answer and evidence to multiple attestations, the user experience can be greatly enhanced. This feature increases the efficiency of business control, risk or entity (asset, application, etc.) owners across the enterprise.</p>
