<p>Hello Central PA Community Members,</p>
<p>We’re looking for a customer to host the next Central PA SNUG in the March timeframe. Does anyone have availability to host this next meeting? We need a room that can fit between 50-70 attendees with projector and screen. </p>
<p>ServiceNow and sponsoring Partner will be responsible for costs and logistics. Please reach out to me if you’d like to host our next Centra PA SNUG &#64; caterine.alvarenga&#64;servicenow.com.</p>
<p> Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Caterine</p>
