<p>Welcome to CreatorCon Workshop CCW0652: Deliver a killer mobile experience for your custom app. This blog post is meant to be an easy way to access workshop links, files, share feedback, and ask questions after the workshop ends.</p>
<h3>Workshop Info</h3>
<ul><li>Presentation: <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_article&amp;sys_id&#61;5f46ab5cdb9d3b0422e0fb24399619c2" rel="nofollow">https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_article&amp;sys_id&#61;5f46ab5cdb9d3b0422e0fb24399619c2</a></li><li>Lab Guide: <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/event/knowledge19/CCW0652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/event/knowledge19/CCW0652</a></li></ul>
<p>You can also work this lab through your Madrid personal developer instance should you so choose. There are two attachments to this post that you&#39;ll need to import into your instance. Import the update set and commit and then import the location xml into the location table. If you have any issues with the locations the lab will work without it. It just makes lab 6 test a little easier.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting Info</h3>
<p><strong>Studio</strong> - There may be times that you don&#39;t see what you should in studio or you can&#39;t see something that you&#39;ve recently created. In those cases you may either way to close out of the tab you&#39;re working in or reload studio altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Agent App</strong> - If you&#39;re running into any issues with your changes not propagating to the agent app, try:</p>
<ul><li>Going back to the home screen and refreshing, then try again.</li><li>Logging out of the app, closing it, then logging back in.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Lab Guide Errors</strong>: None have been discovered so far, but check back here periodically just in case.</p>
