<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Why is <strong>Unique</strong> Names important in Performance Analytics &amp; Reporting in ServiceNow?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like anything else being able to search for something based on its name and meaning, has incredible value. Using <strong>Unique</strong> Names to drive Governance will not only keep Performance Analytics &amp; Reporting clean and organized, but also your Platform in general.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">In this blog we want to highlight some ways that using <strong>Unique</strong> Names will help you when Creating, Maintaining &amp; Organizing within Performance Analytics &amp; Reporting. There are a lot of OOTB things that have already been created with <strong>Unique</strong> Names and you can gain insights on how exactly you should create names from some of those. Here are a few.</span></p>
</td></tr><tr style="height: 17px;"><td style="width: 768px; height: 17px;" colspan="2">
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Indicator Sources</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Use names to capture what you are gathering (you want people searching to be able to find something relative, rather than creating something new). Examples:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1"><li>
<ol class="ol2"><li>
<ol class="ol3"><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Incidents Closed, OOTB name Incidents.Closed</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Incidents Opened, OOTB name Incidents.Open</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Requests Open, OOTB name Requests.Open</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Requests Closed, OOTB name Requests.Closed</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">These are just a few, the idea is to make sure that you name in a manner that has value and understanding as it relates to what is being gathered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, you want fellow users to be able to find and use something existing, rather than create something new.</span></p>
</td></tr><tr style="height: 17px;"><td style="width: 768px; height: 17px;" colspan="2">
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Automated Indicators</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Use names that will let the user know what they can expect to see in the scores gathered in the Automated Indicator. Examples:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1"><li>
<ol class="ol2"><li>
<ol class="ol3"><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Number of open incidents</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Number of re-opened incidents</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Summed duration of closed requests</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Number of new requests</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">These are just a few, the idea is to make sure that your name is in a manner that has value and understanding as it relates to what scores are being shown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, you want fellow users to be able to find and use something existing, rather than create something new.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Breakdown Sources</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Use names that will let the user know what they can expect to see gathered and categorized in the Breakdown Source. Examples:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1"><li>
<ol class="ol2"><li>
<ol class="ol3"><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Incident Priority, OOTB name Incident.Priority</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Incident State, OOTB name Incident.State</span></li><li class="li1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Request State, OOTB name Request.State</span></li></ol>

<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Automated Breakdowns</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Use names that will let the user know what they can expect to see categorized in the Automated Breakdown. Automated Breakdown is an area where you could actually see duplicate or more names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have an Automated Breakdown named State, this could apply to Incident, Request, Problem, Change, etc. But if the Breakdown Source was named <strong>Unique</strong>, users will be able to know when searching which one they should use.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Here is an example of when adding a Breakdown to an Indicator that two results came back when searching for Category. In this situation, if you did not have a <strong>Unique</strong> Name for your Breakdown Source, which one would you choose?</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Widgets</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Widget names being <strong>Unique </strong>are vital for users when searching to find what they need on a dashboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or better yet when deciding if they need to create a widget or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, utilize the Lookup Name for a Widget also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps the Lookup Name could have more descriptive information than even the Widget name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anything to have some Governance and prevent the creation of new Widgets that are not needed.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Dashboards</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">When naming Dashboards make sure the name is clear and precise based on what is expected to be seen on the Dashboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something like Incident probably is not a great idea, however, something like Incident Management (that is OOTB), will give users insight on what they can expect to see when visiting the Dashboard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Dashboard Groups:</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">A place that you really want to make sure you have a <strong>Unique</strong> Name. Taking advantage of the ability to group multiple dashboards with a group, please make sure you give the Dashboard Group a name that will help your users know what to expect within it.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Reporting</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Reporting, just like Indicator Sources, Automated Indicators, Breakdown Sources, and Automated Breakdowns, should have <strong>Unique </strong>Names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reporting can easily get out of control with lots of Reports being created.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if you give them a <strong>Unique</strong> Name and encourage your users to look for an existing report to fit their needs, you can control how many are being created.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Another feature that you could take advantage of, is the ability to have the Report have a different Title on a Dashboard as opposed to its actual name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, you can have a <strong>Unique</strong> Name for the Report that you users can search for, but if a user needed it to have a different Title on the Dashboard, you can do that as well.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Collection Jobs:</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Collection Jobs should always have a <strong>Unique</strong> name, the biggest reason for this, is that you do not want Collection Jobs running on the Platform that are not needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you can have Collection Jobs that have <strong>Unique</strong> names and manage them, then you can add new Indicators to existing jobs, rather than creating another Collection Job, because someone didn’t know where to put an Indicator to be collected. For example, by default, make sure that Daily Collection is a part of the Unique Name of a Daily job and Historical Collection is a part of a Historical job.</span></p>
</td></tr><tr style="height: 17px;"><td style="width: 389px; height: 17px;" colspan="2">
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Try to think of ways to name your Collection Jobs around what they are gathering. Put Incident, Request, Change, Knowledge...etc., in the name to give clarity as to what is being collected.</span></p>
</td></tr><tr style="height: 17px;"><td style="width: 389px; height: 17px;" colspan="2">
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Using <strong>Unique</strong> Names should become a habit that your Organization should adapt to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anywhere in the Platform using <strong>Unique</strong> Names will help you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Governance from a name standpoint should be at the forefront and make sure it does not become an afterthought. Use <strong>Unique</strong> Names to control what is being created and used. Having <strong>Unique</strong> Names in Performance Analytics &amp; Reporting will make Managing the Product more productive for your organization.</span></p>
