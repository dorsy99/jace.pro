<p>If you have been using Performance Analytics (PA) for a while you are probably aware that we also provide packaged solutions, aka Content Packs, of prebuilt sets of indicators, reports and dashboards to support our various applications. These are intended to directly address the key measures of success for each application. As much as possible, we target all the critical players (i.e. personas) in the application space, so that on Day 1 there’s something available to show the impact the application is having on that space.</p>
<p>To date we have over <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/dashboards/concept/content-packs-in-form-analytics.html#r_AvailableContentPacks" rel="nofollow">60 content packs available</a>, each with a mix of PA and Reporting offerings:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/4f51f82ddb54805013b5fb24399619a3.iix" /></p>
<p>Here we’ve listed content packs that are new or have been updated in New York, along with some of the other analytics-related updates. Some are standard, plug-in based add-ons, while others are embedded or included with other features or applications. Some are brand new, and others are updates. And above all, a growing number are available through the store. There is likely something here for you!</p>
<p><em>Instructions for installation are available from each of the linked doc pages.</em></p>
