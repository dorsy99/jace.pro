<p>Cyber Exposure is an emerging discipline for managing and measuring cybersecurity risk in the digital era. It transforms security and risk from a static and siloed state to one that is dynamic and holistic.  </p>
<p>Executives and boards of directors use cyber exposure as a way to objectively measure cyber risk to help guide strategic decision making. Just as other functions have a system of record - including ITSM for IT and CRM for Sales - cyber exposure solutions provide security and risk teams with a system of record to help them effectively manage and measure cyber risk.</p>
<p>Built on the roots of Vulnerability Management, cyber exposure is designed for traditional assets such as IT endpoints and on-premise infrastructure. It expands detection from identifying bugs and misconfigurations to discovery of assets across any compute environment, and continuous visibility into where an asset is secure or exposed. Raw vulnerability data is transformed into business insights to help security and risk teams identify and report on risks to the business.</p>
<p>Tenable™ and ServiceNow work together to offer a solution by combining powerful vulnerability assessment with a security orchestration, automation, and response engine to quickly and effectively remediate security weaknesses. The integrated solution provides you with a single response platform for continuous visibility and critical context across enterprise assets, wherever they are located.</p>
<p>These weaknesses in the form of impacted business services are transformed into risk indicators that can be rolled up into the overall view of risk for an enterprise.  Risk indicators assess the likelihood and business impact of an event based on cyber exposure data aggregated across your extended enterprise, and help you respond to critical changes in risk posture.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership and combined platforms of Tenable and ServiceNow are designed to help your organization increase effectiveness across your cyber security and risk teams. Together we are able to gather data once -- <em>accurately, at scale and efficiently -- </em>applying both a security perspective and a risk perspective.  Once obtained we automate the process of getting it to the right stakeholders via appropriate workflows.</p>
