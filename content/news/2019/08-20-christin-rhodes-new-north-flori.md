<p>We have recently separated the North Florida SNUG into two separate chapters (North Florida and Central Florida) in order to better map our members geographically. North Florida will service Jacksonville over to the panhandle area and Central Florida will service Orlando and Tampa areas. Florida now has three SNUG chapters: Central Florida, North Florida, and South Florida. </p>
<p>You can find the Central Florida SNUG Community <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_forum&amp;sys_id&#61;52295a2ddbd897c068c1fb651f9619a2" rel="nofollow">here</a>, the North Florida SNUG community site <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_forum&amp;sys_id&#61;779b1db7dbd133cc5ed4a851ca96196a" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the South FL SNUG Community <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_forum&amp;sys_id&#61;2a299a2ddbd897c068c1fb651f96192e" rel="nofollow">here</a>. To join any SNUG, simply click on the Subscribe or Join button in the upper right-hand corner.
