<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You&#39;ve Worked Through Your SAM Implementation. Now What?</strong></span></p>
<p>The benefits delivered by a successful SAM and HAM implementation are numerous and varied: better software and hardware spend management, readiness for audits, reduced manual tracking effort, a better customer experience... the list goes on. Getting there involves a good amount of both technical and process effort, but staying there isn&#39;t guaranteed. Ensuring you have the right people, with the right skills, doing the right things, will allow you to keep getting all of those benefits for years to come.</p>
<p>Following are some guidelines around building out your SAM and HAM support teams. The video below also summarizes these points, and a pdf of the presentation used in the video is attached to this article.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Roles</strong></span></p>
<p>There are various roles used to support the process and technical aspects of Software and Hardware Management. We have the following three roles suggested, although there are many ways to bundle job responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Software Asset Management System Administrator</strong></p>
<p>This technical role is responsible for keeping up the maintenance of the SAM product within the ServiceNow platform. They typically have a technical ServiceNow background as a platform administrator (and perhaps more specialized knowledge such as Discovery), and need to learn about software asset management process to perform their function well. However, it may be the case they come from a SAM background and are interested in broadening their technical skillset by assuming this role.</p>
<p>This role works very closely with the Software Asset Manager (below), on a daily or near-daily basis. They would be involved in typical administrative functions such as reviewing any errors in the system, daily logs on software imports, and looking at patch and release notes and working with the platform team during upgrades. They also are involved closely with the Software Asset Manager during software audits, and work closely with the rest of the ServiceNow administrative team including configuration management, Discovery, ITSM, and HAM.</p>
<p>In some smaller organizations, the Software Asset Management System Administrator, and the next role we discuss, the Software Asset Manager, may be the same person wearing two hats. Although it can vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization, we typically see 0.3 - 0.5 FTE (full-time employees) allocated to this role.</p>
<p><strong>Software Asset Manager</strong></p>
<p>This role is the process-oriented counterpart to the SAM System Administrator described above. The Software Asset Manager maintains SAM processes including procurement integration and approvals, software normalization, and reclamation policies. They are heavily involved with software audits, partnering with vendor management (if the function exists in the organization), and the SAM System Administrator. </p>
<p>The Software Asset Manager also interfaces with many department leads frequently in regards to software budgeting and partnering with those departments to look at ways to manage software spend. They are often heavily involved with IAITAM and will look to build industry qualifications and attend various training courses where possible. The FTE count can vary depending on organization size and maturity, but typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 FTE. As mentioned above, depending on the organization this role and the SAM System Administrator role may be the same person.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Asset Manager</strong></p>
<p>Here we do not break the Hardware Asset Manager into two roles as we have for software, however it is certainly possible to do so. Often, desktop or other teams have many staff (whether in-house or outsourced) which in part perform hardware asset management functions, which can include hardware asset lifecycle activities such as deployments and disposal. Ensuring these individual activities are properly updated in ServiceNow is critical and will be a part of the Hardware Asset Manager&#39;s responsibilities, and part of managing the entire hardeare lifecycle from procurement to disposition. </p>
<p> <br />The Hardware Asset Manager typically is familiar with SCCM and CMDB population, and if they have (or are able to gain) a background of ServiceNow Discovery it can be quite an &#39;asset&#39;. Like the Software Asset Manager, they are involved with cost center owners in budgeting and looking for ways to manage cost. They can often also be involved heavily with IAITAM and should look for industry-specific training and accreditations. Typically there are 0.5 – 1.5 FTE for Hardware Asset Managers depending on size of organization and SAM maturity.</p>
