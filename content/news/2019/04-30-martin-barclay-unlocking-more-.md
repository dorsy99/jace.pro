<p>On April 23rd,  we activated Contact Seller as Guest on the Store to enable all app stakeholders - not just those with HI credentials - to engage immediately with partners directly on the Store. Now, business analysts, service and process owners, team leaders, department heads, business leaders outside of IT, and all sorts of potential end users - in business units and departments across the enterprise - can get in touch with partners and get the app buying process started faster!</p>

<p>Guest leads are clearly marked in the Publisher Portal to enable partners to distinguish between HI login contact leads and guest leads. The most interesting part of the screenshot below, however, is not how leads are marked, but the guest lead itself. This is a real lead and actual text from the Notes to Seller field left by someone from KPMG for PlatCore  Learning Management System. </p>

<p>Based on early results this appears to be addressing pent-up demand for non-HI app stakeholders to engage faster with partners on the Store.  Let us know what you think about it in the comments. </p>
