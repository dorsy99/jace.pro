<p class="p1"> In 2019, it is important for professionals to revisit their SAM strategies (and their SAM solutions) and set achievable goals for the year. But where should they start? In this post, we’ll walk through the five steps of getting started in SAM to identify meaningful ways SAM professionals can take back control over company-wide software assets:</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3">Step 1: Identify business needs</li><li class="li3">Step 2: Consider upcoming events</li><li class="li3">Step 3: Create your SAM goals</li><li class="li3">Step 4: Establish SAM outcomes</li><li class="li3">Step 5: Regularly revisit and readjust your SAM goals</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="p3">Step 1: Identify business needs</h2>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">The first step in SAM goal-setting in 2019 is to identify business needs associated with tracking, managing, and optimizing software across the business. As you start to think about how SAM can help you meet business objectives, here are a few thoughts to consider:</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Tracking</strong></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3">“I want to be able to track software effectively throughout the business and not be surprised by shadow IT expenses or applications that are flying under the radar.”</li></ul>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Managing</strong></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3">“I want increased visibility into our software stack, software spend, and entitlements so that I can identify ways to save money and pinpoint applications that are either redundant or are no longer critical to meet our business objectives.”</li></ul>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3">“I want to be able to see where software is going to be deployed and approve the costs before it happens.”</li></ul>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Optimizing</strong></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3">“I want to use data analytics and usage information to optimize our software spend and invest appropriately in the applications we really use and need.”</li></ul>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Operationalizing</strong></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li3">“I want to be able to share data across IT and operationalize software data for consumption by our peers in APM, ITSM, Procurement, SecOps, and HR.”</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p class="p4">Once you’ve considered your business needs, you can then take into account upcoming events that may trigger the need for an updated SAM strategy or SAM solution.</p>
<p class="p4"> </p>
<h2 class="p3">Step 2: Consider upcoming events</h2>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">As we continue to help our customers implement SAM into their day-to-day operations, we’ve noticed that upcoming business events add pressure to SAM professionals who are asked to rationalize the software companies use and justify their software spend. Here are some of the common events SAM professionals face and some of the questions business executives want to be answered:</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<table class="t1" style="width: 740px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="td1" style="width: 325.247px;" valign="top">

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">In addition to the events listed here, there are other events—like company-wide efforts toward digital transformation—that SAM professionals need to consider as they revisit their SAM strategies. If you are unable to answer any of the questions listed above, it may be time to create goals that will empower you with the data and information you need to impress your executives and showcase control over your software assets.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<h2 class="p3">Step 3: Create your SAM goals</h2>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">After you’ve considered your business needs and have taken a look at any upcoming events, you can get started in SAM. Here are some potential goals to help you get started:</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<table class="t1" style="width: 604px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="td1" style="width: 170.212px;" valign="top">

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">These are only a few of the SAM goals you may have in 2019, but no goal would be complete without understanding the outcomes of these goals. In a previous post, we provide <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;39adf793dbcf27409a64e15b8a9619a7" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">potential goals</span></a> your business should consider in the new year.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<h2 class="p3" style="text-align: left;">Step 4: Establish SAM outcomes</h2>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">As you build out your SAM goals, it’s important to outline the tangible outcomes. Remember that the outcomes must support your business needs and have a reasonable timeline. Let’s revisit the tracking, optimizing, and operationalizing software data we discussed earlier and how to determine if they are working.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<table class="t1" style="width: 740px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="td1" style="width: 505.358px;" valign="top">

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">Again, the outcomes you define will vary depending on the goals you set for your SAM strategy. You may also consider adding the following outcomes for SAM in 2019:</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<ul class="ul1" style="text-align: center;"><li class="li3" style="text-align: left;">Build and maintain an accurate software inventory of used and discovered applications</li><li class="li3" style="text-align: left;">Reduced/eliminated true-up costs</li><li class="li3" style="text-align: left;">Consolidation of redundant software/overlapping services</li><li class="li3" style="text-align: left;">Automated processes and workflows</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="p3" style="text-align: left;">Step 5: Regularly revisit and adjust your SAM goals</h2>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">The final step is one that takes place at every level of the business, in every department, and that is to revisit goals. Revisit your SAM goals on a regular basis and readjust your SAM goals as needed as your business needs change. Regularly revisiting your goals helps maintain visibility into your overall SAM strategy and will keep you accountable for the goals you’ve set for yourself.</p>
