<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>New Success Playbook: Stand up a ServiceNow Center of Excellence and Innovation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Adopting ServiceNow as an enterprise platform requires the coordination of different functions and teams within an organization. This includes strategic planning, architecture, design, development, support and more. Building a Center of Excellence and Innovation (CoEI) helps consolidate these roles and functions in order for your organization to realize value quickly and be able to align their ServiceNow investment to business goals. A CoEI also removes the organizational friction that can get in the way of taking a ServiceNow project from the vision phase, to value.</span></p>
