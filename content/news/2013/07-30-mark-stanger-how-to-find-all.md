<p>At Crossfuze, one of the areas we specialize in is helping struggling ServiceNow implementations get back on the right track. One type of issue that we encounter frequently is bad or redundant data that's being used and needs to be deleted, de-activated, or cleaned up in some way. The best way to handle this issue is to keep it out of your system in the first place, but what do you do if it has been there for months or years and has been referenced in who knows how many places and ways? The options vary depending on the situation, but a common component of any potential solution is finding out just how much of a problem you've really got. How do you decide to replace or modify the bad data if you don't even understand where or how that bad data is being used?<br /><br />To help answer this question, we recently created a really useful admin utility to find all places where a record is referenced. In this article I'll show you how you can set it up in your instance! <br /><center><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/find-references-specific-record/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FindRecordReferences-300x184.jpg" alt="Find Record References UI Action" width="300" height="184" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4968" /></a><br /><h3>Learn more at ServiceNowGuru.com!</h3><br /></center><br /><!--break--></p>
