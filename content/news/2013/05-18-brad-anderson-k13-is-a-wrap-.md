<p>It was an incredible week in Vegas! Got to spend time with a lot of customers and see some amazing things being done with the platform. Fred Luddy demoed the new iPhone app coming in Dublin - looks really slick (actually mobile was a big discussion topic all week - from Servicenow, partners and customers).<br /><br />For those of you that were able to make it, I hope you had a great week and safe travels home. Decompress a little this weekend and get after it next week. For those that didn't, make it a priority for next year - the amount of content and exposure to customers and partners is not found anywhere else. Here is a link the Hub page, lots of info and video's posted already: https://knowledge.servicenow.com/k13/hub.do<br /><br />I will keep an eye out for more content as it is made available and post it. K14 will be by the bay in San Francisco, CA.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Brad</p>
