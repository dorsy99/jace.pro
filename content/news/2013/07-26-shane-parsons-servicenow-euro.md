<p>Hopefully everyone will have seen the exciting news from ServiceNow regarding the European events being organised for October. <br /><br />The UK ServiceNow User Group (SNUG) organising team are currently in discussion as to how we can best support the London date (Thursday October 10th), and to confirm our plans for the next SNUG meeting. <br /><br />More details will be posted shortly, but I'd encourage you to register for one of the European dates and I'll see you in London!<br /><br />Warmest Regards,<br />Shane</p>
