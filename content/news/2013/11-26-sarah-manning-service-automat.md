<p>An anonymous U.S. government laboratory and its 1,000 employees support more than 200 research projects in the areas of science, scientific facilities, energy, environment management and national security. The lab's IT support staff had been using an expensive legacy system which operated in silos, preventing integrated, automated workflows and a unified customer interface. <br /><br />After several other sister labs, including <a title="w.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,46fcbd08879eac40318f183a2d434d6d" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,46fcbd08879eac40318f183a2d434d6d">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</a>, implemented ServiceNow, the lab began preparations to introduce ServiceNow to automate and standardize IT. <br /><br />However, before the implementation project was underway, Facilities staff approached IT and requested to use ServiceNow to manage construction for a new building on campus. IT changed course and allowed the lab Facilities team to be the first department to automate service requests through ServiceNow. Now, Facilities can automate the management of all buildings and new construction across campus and has a single system of record for grouping tasks. <br /><br /><a title="mmunity.servicenow.com/files/Asset_CS_Anonymous%20Lab_04NOV13.pdf" href="http://community.servicenow.com/files/Asset_CS_Anonymous%20Lab_04NOV13.pdf">Read the full case study</a> to find out more about the lab's implementation.</p>
