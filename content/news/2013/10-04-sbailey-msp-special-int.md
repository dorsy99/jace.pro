<p>All,<br /><br />MSP Special Interest Group membership has expanded over the past several months and we welcome new MSP users to the group. It's been quite a while since we had a virtual user group meeting, so I'd like to gauge interest in conducting one so we can all meet each other and discuss what's happening with ServiceNow for domain separation. I'm sure we all face common challenges, so forging a strong alliance in the user group can be mutually beneficial. <br /><br />If you're interested in an MSP virtual user group meeting, please respond to let me know. I'll offer to coordinate and host!<br /><br />Also, given that ServiceNow is interested in gravitating towards 'domain separation' rather than 'MSP' so they can encompass a wider range of organizations, also weigh in on whether we should change the group name to Domain Separation user group.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Stacey Bailey</p>
