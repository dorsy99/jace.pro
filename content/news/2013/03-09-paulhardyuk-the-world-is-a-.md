<p>...but according to ServiceNow (OTB) there are only 9 countries in a suggestion field. <img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="d7a95d0adb5c97049c9ffb651f9619ac.iix" style="width: 100px; height: auto;" /><br />Now I work for a global organisation and with offices in 30+ countries and staff who travel to many more. (We capture travel in ServiceNow.) So here is a quick and simple enhancement that we implemented to add 205 countries and their ISO and dial codes, so that we could reuse them across our instance<!--break--><br /><br /><ol><li>Create a u_country table (extend the Task table)</li><li>On that new table create these fields: Name, ISO Code, Continent, Dialing Code, Idd Prefix, Ndd Prefix (type string)</li><li>Download and import [asset|aid=1179|format=link|formatter=asset|title= 205 Countries and related data from here.]<br />(the attached list also contains additional locations that have alternate dialing codes)</li><li>Use your new u_country reference field across your instance.</li></ol><br />Obviously you could add all sorts of other data to this table that might be useful to your organisation.<br /><br /><strong>Hope this helps!</strong><br /><br /><p><em>Disclaimer/Notes</em></p><em><br />- Fully test any new configuration before deploying to your instance.<br />- There are anywhere between 195 and 320 countries in the world dependant on the source.<br />- The attached data is from one source and subject to change, please validate before use.<br />- Based on feedback from ServiceNow I suspect this will become added to a future release.<br />- Idd Prefix stands for International Direct Dialling.<br />- Ndd Prefix stands for National Direct Dialling.</em><br /><br /><br />Until next time...<br /><br /><strong>Paul Hardy</strong><br /><a title="w.twitter.com/paulhardyuk" href="http://www.twitter.com/paulhardyuk">Twitter</a> | <a title="w.linkedin.com/in/paulhardyuk" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulhardyuk">LinkedIn</a><br /><br /></p>
