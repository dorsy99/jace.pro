<p>This may already be common knowledge, but I thought I would share anyways. I recently attended the pilot class for our Application Development Training (that will be offered at Knowledge 13). One of our ServiceNow developers in attendance used a couple of cool script techniques I thought I would capture here for all to share.<br /><br />I cannot take any credit for this (except for posting it here). All credit goes to John Maher.<br /><br />Our requirement was to use an outbound soap message to query another ServiceNow instance for an asset based on a tag. He put this code into a script include called AssetSoapUtil (found below):<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />var AssetSoapUtil = Class.create();<br />AssetSoapUtil.prototype = {<br />    initialize: function() {<br />    },<br /><br />    getAsset: function(tag) {<br />        var s = new SOAPMessage('PWX', 'getRecords');<br />        s.setStringParameter('u_asset', tag);<br />        var response = s.post();<br /><br />        return soapXmlToAsset(response);<br /><br /><br />function soapXmlToAsset(xml) {<br />var obj = new XMLHelper().toObject(xml);<br />var asset = obj["SOAP-ENV:Body"].getRecordsResponse.getRecordsResult;<br />return asset;<br />}<br /><br />    },<br /><br />    type: 'AssetSoapUtil'<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />What I found fascinating was the function soapXmlToAsset(xml) in which he uses the XMLHelper function to deserialize the response into an asset object. This can be used on any response record result.<br /><br />You can use this code to describe the object:<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />var asset = new AssetSoapUtil().getAsset('sometag');<br />gs.log( '\n-- dump obj --\n' + JSUtil.describeObject(asset, 'ass') );<br />gs.log( '\n\n-- JSON String --\n' + new JSON().encodeObject(asset) );<br /></pre><br /><br />There you go. I thought I should share the wealth. We are a community, so hopefully someone out there can make use of this. Thanks again to John.</p>
