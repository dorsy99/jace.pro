<p>ServiceNow includes the ability to provide a full audit and journal history of records in the system. This is an extremely useful feature, but there are times when you need to override this audit process. Some examples may include a technician accidentally entering IT-only work notes into the customer facing 'Additional comments' field on an incident, or an end user supplying confidential information such as a password or social security number in a ticket.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the process of deleting or updating audit, activity, or journal entries is fairly difficult to perform, and even more difficult to remember. The customization shown here makes this process much simpler by leveraging UI actions in the standard 'History -&gt; List' view from any audited record.<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/remove-activity-log-journal-entries"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/updateHistory-300x219.jpg" alt="Update ServiceNow Audit History" width="300" height="219" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4813" /></a><br /><br /><h3>Learn more at ServiceNowGuru!</h3><br /></center><br /><!--break--></p>
