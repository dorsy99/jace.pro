Created a portal to manage music, gig calendar and people for his band; includes modules for charts (songs), chart lists, albums, individual members, jobs, rehearsals, set lists and venues. Far away from traditional ITSM modules.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Company:</span> <i><strong>World Wide Technology</strong></i> - a systems integration company.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Innovation:</span> <strong>Integrated deployment tool with error-checking workflow.</strong><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary:</span> Created a way for deployment groups to perform automated code deployments for any type of deployment directly from ServiceNow; includes automated code deployments for WebMethods, Salesforce.com, Oracle (database changes through OMM packages: DDL/PLSQL/etc), XML rules. Makes sure the deployment is ready to go, the approvals have been received, and prerequisites met. Initiates an integration and does the deployment itself. In this company, ServiceNow manages the entire process from start to finish. Great demonstration of the power of integrating with other technologies.<br/><br/><strong>. . . . . .<br/><br/>2012 Winners:</strong><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Company:</span> <i><strong>Morrison Foerster</strong></i> - a large, full-service law firm with more than 1,000 lawyers in 15 offices.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Innovation:</span> <strong>Runbook Automation workflow to automate Windows7 migration.</strong><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary:</span> created Runbook Automation workflow to migrate 2500 users across 16 offices and 3 continents to Windows7; automated timing for notifications, scheduled tasks for IT analysts, email archive export/imports, exchange migrations, custom dashboards, inbound email actions, and more. <br/>Highlights: Before ServiceNow, MoFo used spreadsheets, paper checklists and other disparate applications to manage Windows7. IT needed to consolidate its management methods and embark on a desktop upgrade â€” a huge challenge. With four different languages and hundreds of applications to support, plus juggling the attorney mindset of "time is money", downtime wasn't an option for MoFo's deployment. MoFo had to replace the engine in a moving car. Results: they calculated 10,000 people hours saved over the span of the project, with 70% of the savings due to Runbook Automation capabilities. Without RBA, the project team would have needed to triple in size. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Company:</span> <i><strong>Pacific Life</strong></i> - an insurance company providing life insurance products, annuities, mutual funds, and investment services.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Innovation:</span> <strong>Location-based services based on floor plan overlays and heat maps.</strong><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary:</span> Find user cubicle locations on any floor without having to open multiple applications from a PC or tablet; this also allows desktop support technicians to see the location of other users with cases open on the same floor.<br/>Highlights: Pacific Life saves over $25,000 a year with this application. Pacific Life's Carlos Gama started the project at Knowledge 2011: he stayed up all night after inspirational conversations with peers that day. He wanted to address a situation that was overly complex, but could have been much simpler: his team needed to look all over the place in the system to find the location of a specific asset. As he says, ServiceNow's open platform inspired the motto, "nothing is impossible". With ServiceNow, if something doesn't exist, you make it exist. Such a simple innovation, but it's easy to see how greatly it impacts productivity. <br/><br/><strong>. . . . . .</strong><br/><br/>Are these amazing uses of ServiceNow technology?</p>
