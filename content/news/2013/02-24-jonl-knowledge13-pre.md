<p>Hi everyone - I'm excited to let you know that our K13 classes are filling fast. As we have in the past two events (San Diego and NOLA), we are running at about 30% of conference registrations. We do our best not to turn anyone away, but at this point we have almost as many registrations as we had for the whole show last year in New Orleans. With new classes on Application Development, Orchestration, and 'classics' like Scripting (now with Jelly!) and Advanced Admin - we're sure to have a ServiceNow Knowledge event to remember!<br/><br/><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://knowledge.service-now.com/k13/k13_preconference.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://knowledge.service-now.com/k13/k13_preconference.do</a><br/><br/>Take care, hope to see you in Vegas.<br/>jon</p>
