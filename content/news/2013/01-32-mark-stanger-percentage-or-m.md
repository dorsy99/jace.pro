In the following article, I'll show you how you can set up some simple scripts in your graphical workflow 'Approval' activities to handle these scenarios for any percentage you choose.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/graphical-workflow/approval-percentage/"><img alt="ServiceNow Majority Approval" src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ServiceNowMajorityApproval-300x243.jpg" width="300" height="243" /></a><br /><br /><h3>Learn more at ServiceNowGuru.com!</h3><br /><!--break--></p>
