<p>The concept of service catalog has been around for well over a decade; but it was the addition of "service catalog management" and the service catalog to ITIL* v3's set of IT service management (ITSM) "best practices" in mid-2007 that started the IT industry's growing obsession with service catalog tools. An obsession where the service catalog was sold, and potentially bought, as the cure to the majority — if not all — of the enterprise IT organization's ITSM, IT service delivery, and customer perception ills.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>In some ways it has felt like that it didn't matter what the question was, the answer always seemed to be: "Buy a service catalog." The child in me wanted to say that if things are really bad in your organization, why not buy two or even more service catalog tools? Service catalog seemed to be the mandatory prescription for most IT-related diseases.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>The promise of service catalog: a view from 2010</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>In 2010 I presented on the growing use of service catalogs, self-service, and automation; and on how they would benefit organizations by:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol><li>Facilitating a service-based approach to service delivery (as espoused by ITIL v3).</li><li>Starting to "get under the skin" of IT services to determine the business value they deliver relative to the resources (people and financial) they utilize.</li><li>Communicating available IT services to the business and the associated costs.</li><li>Providing resource savings from both the ordering and automation of provisioning (plus self-help facilities).</li><li>Using the service catalog as the basis for chargeback and demand management.</li></ol><p><br/>But also that there was the danger that organizations would focus on the service catalog tool, over the required supporting envelope of people and processes, such that the service catalog tool could end up as "CMDB 2.0" — somewhere that IT service data goes to die after an expensive IT implementation project.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>While the warning was fair at the time I think it would be harsh to say that service catalog did become CMDB 2.0; however it has distracted organizations significantly over the last three years. Not only in terms of the time and money invested in technology purchases and deployments with minimal ROI but also the opportunity cost of forgoing other options to improve customer experience and reduce costs in particular.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>We should have known better — IT people like to buy technology, the service catalog became a technology project.</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Many things seems obvious with hindsight — it is definitely true with service catalog. We should have known and pre-empted the following:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li>Organizations taking a "Let's buy a service catalog tool" approach — which is not dissimilar to the eternally popular "Let's buy a new ITSM tool" approach.</li><li>There being insufficient understanding of the IT services actually consumed by customers, i.e. the things that should populate the service catalog. And this is from the customer's, not IT's, point of view.</li><li>That the service catalog as a whole would be created in the image of the IT organization rather than being based on real business needs.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>So what business issue or opportunity is service catalog trying to help with? Is it just the latest must-have shiny ITSM tool for IT? And will customers actively use it?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Though thankfully things continue to get better as we learn from our own mistakes (as well as those of others) and leverage expert resource. But it's not to say that we still don't need to change the mindset around the service catalog to increase the odds of implementation and adoption success. We still do.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Think of the service catalog, or service request catalog, tool as the tip of the iceberg</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Many talk of "an Amazon.com-like" experience, or storefront and shopping basket, when describing service catalog tools — but it's the proverbial tip of the iceberg.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>As with many easy-to-use service experiences the Amazon customer doesn't see, or need to see, the rest of the demand and supply chain which can include elements such as design, purchasing and production, marketing, inventory, distribution, accounting, and warranty. But an IT organization will struggle to successfully deliver on the promise of service catalog with only the visible tip of the iceberg. There is so much more to consider.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>So what can you do to help ensure that your organization's service catalog initiative doesn't die a slow and painful death at the hands of misguided IT project people and unreceptive customers? </p><center><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1347-2218/diagram.png"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="431" src="b26a9ccadb185304b322f4621f961956.iix" width="702"/></a></center><p><br/><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">5 suggestions for improving your odds of "service catalog" success:</strong><br/><br/></p><ol><li>Use service portfolio management as the precursor to service catalog management activity. Understand your services. And do it in business rather than IT terms.</li><li>Be clear about the objectives for service catalog management and not just the tool. Remember that this isn't just a data collection and presentation exercise.</li><li>Ensure that the other ITSM processes needed to get the best out of a service catalog are fit for purpose, such as financial management (service costing through to accounting), service level management, and configuration management.</li><li>Don't emphasize the shopping cart front-end at the expense of back-end data and activities, i.e. consumption monitoring, to help make optimal supply decisions, and the automation of provisioning — the proverbial "better, quicker, cheaper."</li><li>Continue to involve your customers; actively seek feedback and be open to criticism; monitor usage, and offer coaching and training. And think ahead — look at the potential for future shared services exploitation, a single employee portal in conjunction with HR and Facilities, say.</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><em><strong>Getting the promised benefits out of service catalog management involves so much more than just buying a tool.</strong></em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>* ITIL is the ITSM best practice framework formerly known as The IT Infrastructure Library.</p>
