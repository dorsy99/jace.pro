<p>"You Must Have A Service Catalog." Really? Thankfully this isn't my advice to you. It's just a bold statement that I wish I didn't hear or read almost weekly. Our obsession with yet another IT service management (ITSM) tool, module, or capability — the service catalog — is now over five years old and it seems every IT organization continues to be advised, or concludes themselves, that a service catalog is an absolute must-have and silver bullet to customer-related woes.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>In my opinion, it's best that we look back before we look forward with service catalogs.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Service catalog — the story so far</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>While the concept of the service catalog has been around for well over a decade it was its introduction in ITIL v3 that slowly brought it into vogue. I've seen many statistics on the demand for, adoption levels, and success of service catalog initiatives. However my favourite is a lot less scientific — the result of my "ask the audience" moments during presentations at various global ITSM events.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>So how many organizations had a service catalog? In 2012-13 it ranged from 30-50% of the audience, probably a reflection of geography. But, more importantly, how many audience members felt as though they'd received the promised or expected benefits from their service catalog initiative? Usually (and consistently) a very lowly 1-2%.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>So where is the "management" in "service catalog management," or strategy and planning?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>As with the CMDB, with the technology overshadowing the ITIL-espoused process of service asset and configuration management, the service catalog tool has too often been the corporate objective at the expense of service catalog management. But, IMO, even service catalog management isn't enough for real success and there are other common mistakes:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol><li>The "let's buy a service catalog tool" approach (which is not dissimilar to the "let's buy an ITSM tool approach").</li><li>The service catalog (management) initiative objectives can be limited or misjudged.</li><li>There is little or no understanding of the IT services that should populate the service catalog.</li><li>The service catalog is created in the image of the IT organization rather than business need.</li></ol><p><br/>In light of the above, is your service catalog initiative a potential train wreck waiting to happen?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>The real need for service catalog capabilities and the building blocks for success</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>The following owes a big debt to many others in particular <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://nz.linkedin.com/in/robenglandattwohills" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rob England</a>, the IT Skeptic and jobbing IT consultant, and <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jamesfinister" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">James Finister</a>, European SIAM (Service Integration and Management) Lead at TCS. In their respective service catalog-related blogs:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li>Rob differentiated between a service catalog (a list of services, perhaps the output of service portfolio management) and a service request catalog. It makes sense that a possible cause of service catalog failure is that we really don't know what we are trying to achieve/deliver.</li><li>James wrote of the myth of the service catalog being a "silver bullet" that brings in the customer POV, and offers "What you really need to do"-type advice.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Referring to the somewhat basic figure below, when we talk of service catalog do we not try to do the middle circle but expect to accomplish the whole? </p><center><br/><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1318-2076/sctool.jpg"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="244" src="7f33ed0edbdc1b04ed6af3231f961908.iix" width="500"/></a></center><p><br/>In reality there probably isn't a middle circle, with what has traditionally been called the service catalog the intersection, or overlap, of the outer two circles — service portfolio management and self-service. So is it any wonder that so many service catalog initiatives are considered sub-optimal if we charge at the middle circle and neglect to fully consider the outer two?<br/><br/>I'm happy to stick my neck out to suggest that we should defer from the term "service catalog" in favor of service portfolio management (albeit with a broader definition: the "portfolio management of services" rather than the "management of the service portfolio") and something like "self-service and automation." To continue with service catalog might continue to limit our thinking and our chances of success.<br/><br/><strong>10 suggestions for improving your odds of "service catalog" success</strong><br/><br/>So what can you do to help ensure that your service catalog initiative doesn't die a slow death in the hands of misguided project people and unreceptive customers? Here are a few suggestions (and yes I continue to use "service catalog" for now):<br/><br/></p><ol><li>Definitely think "service catalog management" and not just "service catalog."</li><li>Service portfolio management should be the precursor to service catalog management. And do it in business rather than IT terms.</li><li>Getting the right people involved is key. This is the business' service catalog not IT's.</li><li>Be clear about the objectives for service catalog management and not just the tool.</li><li>Remember that this isn't just a data collection exercise.</li><li>Ensure that the other ITIL processes needed to get the best out of a service catalog are fit for purpose, such as financial management (service costing through to accounting), service level management, and configuration management.</li><li>Don't emphasize the shopping cart front-end at the expense of back-end data and activities, i.e. consumption monitoring, to help make optimal supply decisions, and the automation of provisioning — the proverbial "better, quicker, cheaper."</li><li>Align your service catalog initiative with your corporate automation initiative(s) to help ensure that relevant experience is leveraged, integrations are catered for, and duplication of effort and possibly cost is avoided.</li><li>Continue to involve your customers; actively seek feedback and be open to criticism; monitor usage, and offer coaching and training.</li><li>Finally think ahead — look at the potential for future shared services exploitation, a single employee portal in conjunction with HR and Facilities, say.</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>So is a service catalog really a "must-have"?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>A service catalog tool by itself? Definitely no.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Something that uses service portfolio management and people, process, and technology to deliver the potential business benefits of self service, workflow, and automation? Yes - if you plan and deliver it right.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><em><strong>A longer (double-length) version of this blog will appear as an <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.thinkhdi.com/topics/library/supportworld.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HDI SupportWorld article</a> in September (but will only be available to HDI members).</strong></em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><hr/><ol><li style="list-style: none;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></span></li></ol><p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.itskeptic.org/content/service-catalogue-vs-service-request-catalogue" rel="nofollow">http://www.itskeptic.org/content/service-catalogue-vs-service-request-catalogue</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://coreitsm.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/we-need-to-talk-about-service-catalogue.html" rel="nofollow">http://coreitsm.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/we-need-to-talk-about-service-catalogue.html</a></span></p><ol><li style="list-style: none;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><br/></span></li></ol>
