<p>I wanted to share a new insight I had into ServiceNow. Many of us know that when you create tables, that contain references to other tables, they show up in the related list you can include on the form. <br /><p><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/relationships/relatedlist.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br /></p><p><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/relationships/relatedlist2.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br /></p><p><br />What a lot of people (including myself until recently) didn't know was that you can create a relationship between any table in ServiceNow <b>without having a reference or foreign key shared.</b> I am going to show you how.<br /></p><p><br />The first thing you need to do is migrate to the "Relationships" module under System Definition:<br /></p><p><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/relationships/relationship1.jpg" width="600" height="300" /><br /></p><p><br />Create a new Relationship between the two tables you want:<br /></p><p><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/relationships/relationship2.jpg" width="600" height="250" /><br /></p><p><br />This step is optional, but there are some hidden fields you can use as well to help filter what shows up in your list. I am not going to do this to my CMALOY - Test relationship, but if you look at the "Storage File Shares" relationship or any others out of the box you can get an idea how to use the filters:<br /></p><p><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/relationships/relationship3.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br /></p><p><br />Next go back to your applies to table (in my case I used incident) and personalize the incident form related list. Your new relationship is now accessible there:<br /></p><p><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/relationships/final1.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br /></p><p><br />Check out the form you added the new related list on and voilí :<br /></p><p><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/relationships/final2.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br /></p><p><br />Cheers.</p></p>
