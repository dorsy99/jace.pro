<p>Christmas and the New Year are often times to reflect upon the previous twelve months and to look forward to the next. So it seemed timely to look back to Knowledge13, ServiceNow's annual global customer event, and then forward to the upcoming Knowledge14 event in San Francisco.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Held at the Aria in Las Vegas last May, the Knowledge13 event was attended by 4000 IT pros making it one of the largest IT service management (ITSM) events in the world. But to call it an "ITSM event" is an understatement and perhaps misses the point of the conference. Knowledge is a business-focused event where attendees share, and learn from, success stories related to innovation, cloud, mobile, automation, app dev, customer-centricity, enterprise enablement, ITSM, and more.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Knowledge13 — by the numbers</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>The most amazing number has to be the number of attendees — close to 4000 — and the year-on-year attendee growth levels. As the diagram shows, attendance has doubled year-on-year since Knowledge07:</p><center><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1361-2271/k14registration.png"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="307" src="e5b8e04adb94d704ed6af3231f961908.iix" width="473"/></a></center><p><br/>At Knowledge13 there were <strong>174</strong> breakout sessions and labs:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li><strong>15,716</strong> lab instances were provisioned by ServiceNow Orchestration</li><li>There were close to <strong>10,000</strong> individual lab attendees and none were turned away due to capacity issues.</li></ul><p><br/>Of the <strong>120</strong> breakout sessions:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li><strong>93%</strong> of sessions were delivered by customers (other sessions included industry analysts and industry luminaries such as Gene Kim and Ken Gonzalez)</li><li><strong>15</strong> breakouts were delivered by customer executives.</li></ul><p><br/>There were 9 pre-conference training courses with nearly 1,000 students — that's double the previous year and more than the entire attendee audience for Knowledge11.<br/>There were <strong>45</strong> Innovation of the Year entries — again double that of the previous year.
