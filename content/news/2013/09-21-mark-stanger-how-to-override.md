<p>6+ years ago when I was an admin first being introduced to ServiceNow, I remember being blown away by how simple it was to personalize forms, add fields, and design custom form views. Custom views are very easy to make, but I'm always hesitant to recommend them due to the unintended complexity they can cause. The biggest issue with the 'view' concept in ServiceNow is that the system insists on forcing that form view onto every record referenced from within it. This issue exists in every ServiceNow instance today. In this article, I'll explain why this can be a huge problem, and finally, a good way to break the ServiceNow form view inheritance cycle!<br /><br /><h3><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/overriding-servicenow-form-view-inheritance/"><b>Click here</b></a> to learn more at ServiceNowGuru!</h3><br /><!--break--></p>
