<p><i>"The enterprise that does not innovate ages and declines. And in a period of rapid change such as the present, the decline will be fast."</i> -Peter Drucker<br/><br/>According to ServiceNow Founder and Chief Product Officer Fred Luddy, the deepest and most meaningful part of working with the ServiceNow technology is getting to see what customers build on the platform. <br/><br/>More often than not, Fred is left asking, "You built WHAT?"<br/><br/>Our founder never dreamed the ServiceNow platform would be capable of supporting the type of innovation customers continually surprise us with. Every day, applications are built that change the way a business functions. CIOs can <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,4dbca32e8716f440a098183a2d434d55" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">deliver ROI in as little as 30 days</a>. Incident and request administrators can <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,b70381f2872ae080318f183a2d434d52" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">find any device in any cube on any floor</a> of a multi-story building. You can even <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,38415d558740a000e4ab7b2d7d434d3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">invent an online game</a>, with prizes, to improve employee performance. <br/><br/>Just last week, <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,5dbcac4bff578040d4d9f62c297efe65" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CERN</a> confirmed the existence of a particle that shapes much of our understanding of the Universe. Yes, the Universe. The CERN IT team manages tens of thousands of requests from the thousands of scientists who work at and visit CERN. With ServiceNow and CERN's Service Portal, IT coordinates housing, materials, guards, shuttles, visitor registration, building access, waste, cars, cleaning, shipping, and even job applications. The Fire and Rescue team even has their own application with special forms, and formal reporting and distribution functions to meet their specific needs. CERN is a role model for the most innovative, pioneering organizations on the planet, not just with their use of ITSM technology. Our customers solve real-world problems. They inspire us to make the ServiceNow platform better and easier to build upon. <br/><br/>These are just a few examples of the creativity and brilliance we see from customers all the time. But now it's your turn to jump into the hotbed of innovation.<br/><br/>Don't miss the opportunity to have YOUR invention highlighted by Fred Luddy onstage at Knowledge 13. <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,106b9b50870c058093db7b2d7d434d67" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Watch the March 20 webinar</a> to hear Fred talking about why sharing what you've built for your company is so important.
