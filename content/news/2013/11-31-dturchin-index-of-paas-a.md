Stock prices were up a scant <font color="green"><b>1.1%</b></font> but all other categories in the index including PaaS-related tweets, job posts, news headlines, and search results slid an average of <font color="red"><b>2.1%</b></font>. A massive drop in <a title="witter.com/search?q=%23paas&src=typd" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23paas&amp;src=typd">Tweets with the "#Pass" hashtag</a> led the decline. <br /><!--break--><br />Declines in November and December are typical due to light trading volume on the major stock indexes and an overall reluctance by companies to make major announcements during the pre-Thanksgiving through New Year's slowdowns. <b>Call it consumerism trumping consumerization</b>. Holiday slowdown aside, IPA completed its first year up <font color="green"><b>4.3%</b></font> having whipsawed between a high of <b>128.0</b> in April and a low of <b>91.8</b> in December.<br /><br />A <a title="w.eweek.com/small-business/cloud-storage-adoption-rising-among-businesses-twinstrata.html" href="http://www.eweek.com/small-business/cloud-storage-adoption-rising-among-businesses-twinstrata.html">study commissioned by cloud storage vendor TwinStrata</a> found that PaaS adoption grew the fastest in the past year across all cloud initiatives. <b>37%</b> of respondents have been using cloud computing in some form for at least three years up from <b>27%</b> in 2012. Chief among obstacles large enterprises (those with more than 1,000 employees) cite to additional cloud adoption are <b>security, cost, performance, reliability, and uptime</b>. Those last two aren't surprising given the black eye PaaS vendor Salesforce.com gave cloud vendors with its <a title="lthingsd.com/20131115/salesforce-went-down-for-about-three-hours-today-in-north-america-and-europe/" href="http://allthingsd.com/20131115/salesforce-went-down-for-about-three-hours-today-in-north-america-and-europe/">three-hour service outage</a> November 15. <br /><br />Despite the, uh, dark cloud cast by the Salesforce outage, cloud aficionados have reason to rejoice: a <a title="w.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2013/11/20/cloud-computing-may-save-u-s-federal-government-20-billion-a-year-but-theres-more-to-it-than-just-cost-savings/" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2013/11/20/cloud-computing-may-save-u-s-federal-government-20-billion-a-year-but-theres-more-to-it-than-just-cost-savings/">study of 153 federal IT executives by IT consultant MeriTalk</a> revealed PaaS has the potential to save the federal government $20 billion a year or nearly a third of its annual IT budget. As government agencies shift the burden of maintaining legacy systems and developing new applications to cloud-based environments, overall support costs will plummet. <br /><br />PaaS reduces the cost and complexity of every facet of the app dev lifecycle: from demand management through to governance, provisioning, storage, security, versioning, and analysis. If the government, not known for cost efficiency, plans to shave a third of its budget with PaaS, imagine what it will do for the rest of us.</p>
