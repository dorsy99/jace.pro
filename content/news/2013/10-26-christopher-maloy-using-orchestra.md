<p>This blog is a followup to the previous blog I did about using AD CMDLETS:<br />http://community.servicenow.com/blog/christophermaloy/running-active-directory-cmdlets-your-workflow-powershell<br /><p><br />and<br /></p><p><br />http://community.servicenow.com/blog/christophermaloy/using-orchestration-move-ad-user-another-ou-container<br /></p><p><br /><br />This is a specific example of using ServiceNow Orchestration to rename an AD user object.<br /><br />You have to use the Run Powershell Activity, but this, with the leverage of the AD CMDLET API, makes AD system administration very easy.<br />Hopefully the images below are self explanatory.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.hobbycache.com/images/servicenow/WorkflowActivities/powershell3.jpg" width="400" height="250" /></p></p>
