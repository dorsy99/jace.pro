<p>A group of North Texas User Group members met on Tuesday February 12th at the ServiceNow office in Dallas for the first Tech Tuesday get-together. Tech Tuesday is a technical deep drive into a predetermined subject. Our first deep dive was on Asset Management as of the Berlin release. We would like to thank all the ServiceNow guys in Dallas and especially Dave Knight, Jeremy Smith and Dean Klinger for making this a successful meeting and looking forward to more Tech Tuesdays.</p>
