<p>"Faster, Better, Cheaper"</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>This is a quote I have heard some people use to refer to our growing <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,6ad6bf5a87662c40e4ab7b2d7d434d78" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Process User Training program</a> . I will make an attempt to explain how each term describes our program:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Faster</strong><br/>We can customize process user training for a customer in about a week's time for a given process. For example, if a customer wants us to develop training for their Incident Management application, we would need <strong>less than a week</strong> to run through our scoping sessions and develop the PPT slides and step-by-step labs for them; all customized to their instance and workflows.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Better</strong><br/>We have incorporated many best practices into our templates that customers can leverage in the training.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Cheaper</strong><br/>Due to the fact that we can create this content relatively quickly, it comes as at a lower cost to customers than if they were to try and budget this work internally. We hope that by leveraging our templates and expertise, we can provide you with high quality, customized training content at a fraction of the cost.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>As I have mentioned in previous posts, we have several delivery options that are available: live training, virtual live training, self-paced recordings, and train-the-trainer. You can utilize any one or more of these formats to help deliver the content to your respective audiences.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>If you have any further questions about this program, please do not hesitate to contact your local ServiceNow rep or myself at <a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:andy.ho@servicenow.com">andy.ho@servicenow.com</a></p>
