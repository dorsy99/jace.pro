<p>Ah Dublin, often quoted as a favorite city or one that's near the top of a global traveler's bucket list — who wouldn't want to sample the beauty, history, culture, food, and people of the city that spawned Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, and Bram Stoker.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>But now "Dublin" is also one of the most capability-enhancing ServiceNow releases. As ServiceNow's second release of 2013, Dublin adds:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li>Vendor Performance Management</li><li>Resource Management</li><li>Password Reset</li><li>Configuration Automation</li><li>An optimized HTML5 smartphone interface</li><li>App Creator enhancements</li><li>A new HR Service Automation Application</li><li>ServiceNow Notify — a new alerting service.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Visually, Calgary is extended from:</p><center><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1352-2243/1.png"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="269" src="275a24cadbd4d704ed6af3231f96199f.iix" width="473"/></a></center><p><br/>To this:</p><center><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1352-2244/2.png"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="269" src="a74a0c06db109fc068c1fb651f9619c2.iix" width="473"/></a></center><p><br/><strong>Highlighting and explaining the differences</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Visually:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><center><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1352-2245/3.png"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="269" src="645be775dbd4dfc0b322f4621f961966.iix" width="473"/></a></center><p><br/>And through a quick overview of the new or enhanced capabilities …<br/><br/><strong>Vendor Performance Management</strong><br/><br/>ServiceNow Vendor Performance Management is designed for the changing IT sourcing and vendor management landscape — especially as enterprise adoption of the SIAM (service integration and management) model increases. Where, driven by the need to manage portfolios of disparate service providers, enterprise need the ability to better understand the performance of these vendors from both contract and service management perspectives.<br/> <br/>The application leverages the ServiceNow single system of record to pull in information about supplier-related costs, incident and problem records, usage, and warranty and service contracts along with ServiceNow's surveying capabilities to allow customers to evaluate, score, and compare/rank vendors across a variety of categories such as compliance, product reliability, and user satisfaction. Do you really know how well your vendors are performing?<br/><br/>More information can be found <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/vendor-performance-management.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a><br/><br/><strong>Resource Management</strong><br/><br/>ServiceNow Resource Management again leverages the single system of record. It extends what enterprises have traditionally done with project-based resources and activities to take a business-wide view of people activities and costs. After all most enterprises spend more on keeping-the-lights-on people and activities than they do with projects.<br/><br/>The application pulls in information, including costs, from incident and problem management, change and release management, configuration management, service catalog, work management, application development, and project management activities to give project managers, resource managers, and IT and business executives total resource visibility. <br/><br/>ServiceNow Resource Management allows project managers and resource managers to create resource plans, request staffing for projects, see where demand exceeds supply, and assign people to specific tasks. It's a consolidated view of staff availability, allocation, and capacities for all work tracked in any ServiceNow application — a better way to manage scarce and potentially expensive people resource.<br/><br/>More information can be found <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/it-service-automation-applications/resource-management.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/> <br/><strong>Password Reset</strong><br/><br/>Password resets are the bane of many IT service desks — different analyst firms and industry bodies often quote that password resets account for 20% and upwards of service desk workloads. More importantly the inability to access IT services is an impediment to employee productivity and business operations.<br/><br/>ServiceNow Password Reset significantly reduces the overall volume of IT service requests by enabling employees to reset their own passwords using self-service and automation. It brings the familiar password reset experience of consumer Internet applications to enterprise IT, optimized for Active Directory and extensible to support custom credential stores and verification methods. It gets employees up-and-running again more efficiently.<br/><br/>More information can be found <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/password-reset.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a><br/><br/><strong>Configuration Automation</strong><br/><br/>ServiceNow Configuration Automation is an orchestration application that automates the configuration of data center infrastructure. The application integrates ServiceNow Change Management and CMDB with Puppet, from Puppet Labs, a server configuration solution, can be used to simulate, enforce, and report on infrastructure configuration changes.<br/> <br/>Together, ServiceNow and Puppet create a unified system that drives automated, governed configuration changes. Modifying the configuration of physical, virtual, or cloud assets is now as easy as: following established corporate change management processes, updating the agreed change to the CMDB, and then allowing automation to effect the change.<br/><br/>More information can be found <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/configuration-automation.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a><br/><br/><strong>HTML5 smartphone interface</strong><br/><br/>ServiceNow has long had a mobile interface. The Dublin release enhances this capability as well as adding an Android-tablet optimized interface to that for the iPad. <br/><br/>But the real beauty of the new interface is that all applications are instantly mobile — whether ServiceNow apps or bespoke apps created on the ServiceNow Service Automation Platform by customers and partners — there is nothing additional to design, build, and configure or to purchase to make apps mobile. <br/><br/>There is no need to configure multiple mobile apps, workflows, or gateway servers. Furthermore, applications are automatically optimized for display on tablets and smartphones, providing enhanced interface features specific to small form-factor mobile devices. You now truly have the ability to provide instantly available mobile applications to employees and customers through ServiceNow.<br/><br/>More information can be found <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/mobile.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a><br/>â€ƒ<br/><strong>App Creator enhancements</strong><br/><br/>As with the mobile interface, App Creator isn't new — it has been enhanced driven by customer needs. Firstly, Team Development extends the custom app creation capability to allow teams of "creators" to work together on creating applications on the Service Automation Platform. This improves the ability of teams of developers to work in parallel, reduces rework associated with feature conflicts, and ultimately improves release visibility and velocity.<br/><br/>Secondly, as service catalogs continue to play a more important role in IT service delivery and management, App Creator now delivers one-click publishing to the service catalog. When you add this capability to the HTML5 mobile interface, the IT organization can now deliver new capabilities to the enterprise at a speed more in line with its expectations.<br/><br/><strong>HR Service Automation</strong><br/><br/>ServiceNow has long delivered capabilities to support non-IT operations. This is a formalization of HR service automation which has been driven by customer needs — it's part of ServiceNow's vision to support IT organizations in enabling other corporate lines of business and their service relationships.<br/><br/>The enterprise IT organization can help transform HR service provisioning and management capabilities by leveraging IT's service relationship ecosystem, experience, and service automation capabilities. Where extending IT service models into HR finally gives the HR function the ability to meet employee expectations of HR support and customer service through more efficient HR operations. <br/><br/>I recommend the associated white paper, available <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/hr-service-automation.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, which shows the similarities between HR and IT operations, and how IT can help its HR peers improve.<br/><br/><strong>ServiceNow Notify</strong><br/><br/>Last but not least — this new notification capability is built in conjunction with <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.twilio.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twilio</a> and adds SMS and voice notification capabilities to existing email facilities. <br/><br/>Simply put, ServiceNow identifies issues and invokes Twilio to notify the people that need to know using the communication channel or channels of their choice. A popular use case will be for major incident management but it could be used in a number of other scenarios.<br/><br/><strong>Want more detail?</strong><br/><br/>If you want to know more than I detail above, please speak with your ServiceNow rep, follow this blog's links to website content, and look out for the press releases. <br/><br/>Two press releases were released today, listed below, with remainder set for a later date:</p><ol><li><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,c0a8ede06f495540391fe13f9f3ee4cc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Mobilizes The Enterprise</a></li><li><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,5888ede06f495540391fe13f9f3ee424" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Implements HR Case Management</a></li></ol>
