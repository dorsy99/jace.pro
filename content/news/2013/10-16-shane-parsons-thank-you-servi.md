<p>I hope everyone who attended the NowForum event last week, found the day as exciting and informative as I did. <br /><br />I was particularly impressed with Fred's demonstration of the new look and feel for mobile devices, and I for one feel ServiceNow should seriously consider making a takeover bid for the applications developed during the CreateNow Hackathon! <br /><br />Seriously though, thank you ServiceNow and the various partners for organising the event. <br /><br />We now look forward to the next UK SNUG event on Wednesday 27th November, kindly hosted by Team Focus Europe. Tthe official invite and call for registration will be issued shortly.</p>
