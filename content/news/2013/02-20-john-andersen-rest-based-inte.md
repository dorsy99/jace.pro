<p>A few years ago, I developed a SOAP-based proof of concept integration between ServiceNow and JIRA. Recently, Atlassian announced that the JIRA SOAP web service interface was to be deprecated in favor of their newer REST-based API. Due to this change, I have had several customers approach me with the question, can ServiceNow integrate properly with JIRA now that Atlassian will be focusing on SOAP. The following PoC setup serves as an example of bi-directional communication between ServiceNow and JIRA.<br /><br />To see a demo of the new integration, view the documentation, or download the Update Set please browse on over to my <a href='http://www.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/rest-based-servicenow-jira-integration-poc.html'>REST-based ServiceNow integration with JIRA</a> blog post.</p>
