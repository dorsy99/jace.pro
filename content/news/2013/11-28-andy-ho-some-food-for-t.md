<p>The Thanksgiving holiday is upon us here in the United States. As I look back on this year, I am thankful for all of the great employees, partners, and customers that I get to work with on a daily basis as part of the ServiceNow ecosystem. <br/><br/>I've been writing posts for the better part of the last two years and thought I would provide a few links to previous posts that are still relevant today:<br/><br/><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.servicenow.com/blog/andyho/training-formats-explained" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Training Formats Explained (ILT, VILT, TTT, Self-Paced)</a> <br/><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.servicenow.com/blog/andyho/servicenow-education-services-team-introduces-learning-credits" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Learning Credits FAQ</a> <br/><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.servicenow.com/blog/andyho/quickstart-ipcc-whats-included-training-package" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">QuickStart for IPCC Training Package FAQ</a> <br/> <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.servicenow.com/blog/andyho/servicenow-education-services-team-introduces-asset-management-training-course" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asset Management Training FAQ</a> <br/><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.servicenow.com/blog/andyho/servicenow-education-services-team-introduces-process-user-training-program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Process User Training FAQ</a> ** This program is now referred to as Fulfiller Training<br/><br/>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
