<p><h1 id="jello">Jello</h1><br /><p>A small Javascript library to convert Javascript â†’ Jelly.</p><br /><h3 id="what-is-jello-and-why-do-you-have-to-use-it"><b>What is Jello and Why do you want to use it:</b></h3><br /><p>Jello is a <em>tiny</em> converter which converts Javascript to Apache Jelly. It basically works by converting the Javascript code you write into an AST and then walking down the AST and convert it to Apache Jelly.</p><br /><p>Use Jello to write easy UI pages in Javascript! You really don't need to know the syntax of Apache Jelly, All you need to know are the concepts.</p><br /><p>Here is the look of Jello editor currently hosted on my website. Soon, in the following releases you will be able to get this editor in your instances :)</p><br /><br />But you can start writing UI page/Macros in Javascript and copy it into your instance from the editor below!<br /><br /><a href="http://servicenowdiary.com/Jello-master/examples.htm"><img height="400" width="635" src="http://community.servicenow.com/files/editor.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><br /><b>You can access the editor here :</b> http://servicenowdiary.com/Jello-master/examples.htm <br /><br /><br /><p>Somethings to note when using the editor:</p><br /><ul><li>Use only modern browsers(IE 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari) - This limitation is there only because of the ACE editor. Soon when you import Jello to your instances, you don't need a modern browser to use Jello.</li><li>If Simultaneous Conversion isn't enabled, use CTRL+M to convert Javascript to Jelly.</li><li>If simultaneous Conversion is enabled, you don't have to do anything.</li><li>Supports only Jelly Phase1(right now)</li></ul><br /><p><strong>Before you start with anything, Please refer to the intro and docs here</strong> : <a title="rvicenowdiary.com/Jello-master/index.html" href="http://servicenowdiary.com/Jello-master/index.html">Jello</a></p><br /><h3 id="sounds-okay-but-wait"><b>Sounds okay? But wait!</b></h3><br /><p>Couple of important things to note about Jello.</p><br /><ul><li>This is the first release of Jello. It's version is 0.0.1</li><li>It doesn't have a very good Exceptional Handling mechanism. Even if your Javascript is bad or wrong, it simply keeps quite.</li><li>It doesn't support Jelly Phase two, Only phase one for now.</li></ul><br /><p>The most important reason that I'm releasing it now is because Jello needs contributions from each one of you, to use it, validate it and more importanly contribute to it. I'm by no means a Jelly Jedi, and really needs contributions from each one of you!</p><br /><p>If you are ready to contribute to Jello, here is the <a title="ithub.com/abhididdigi/Jello/tree/master/Jello-master" href="https://github.com/abhididdigi/Jello/tree/master/Jello-master">Github Repo</a> .</p><br /><p>Thank you and have fun with Jello!</p></p>
