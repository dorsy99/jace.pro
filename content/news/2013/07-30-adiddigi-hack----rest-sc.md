<p>We can use SOAP Scripted Web Services when you want to do something more than just send the XML data from standalone tables. <br />We can set some Input/output parameters, create an XML , send it by writing code in Script part of Scripted Web Services.<br /><br />Similarly - I came up with a Script Include to receive some inputs from REST Web services, write code based on these inputs , execute this code and send the result( in JSON) back to the caller.<br /><br />You can read about it more on <a title="ithub.com/abhididdigi/JSON-Scripted-Web-Service/blob/master/README.md" href="https://github.com/abhididdigi/JSON-Scripted-Web-Service/blob/master/README.md">Github</a><br /><br />I've also attached the Update Set, so you can install the update set from here. All the other resources are stored in my repository. Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
