<p>Hope the holidays treated everyone well and the new year is off to a great start. Just wanted to start discussing the first Indiana LUG of 2013. Interactive Intelligence has agreed to host this quarter's event so the real question is what would you like to hear more about. Please contact me with thoughts or ideas and I can create a poll to see what kind of interest we have for each topic. I know we have been digging into Change Management, Scrum, Service Catalog and Asset Management. <br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
