<p>I was developing an application in Calgary and when I was done, I created an Update Set of my application. This Update Set was only compatible with Calgary and my customer was on Aspen. With the help of Christen Mitchell, on my team, we were able to successfully manually modify all of the Customer Updates that were part of that Update Set then export it to XML and got it to work on Berlin and Aspen. <br /><br />This tool will do that for you so you don't have to manually modify all of the XML in each Customer Update. What this tool will do is create a copy of the Update Set, then parse through all the Customer Updates and create new ones without all the references to Calgary for the new Update Set. It will then save the new Update Set with the (Pre Calgary) text added to the name.<br /><br />NOTE: This is not an officially supported tool from ServiceNow. Use at your own risk. But I thought I would post it so it could help others.<br /><br /><!--break--><br /><b>Install Tool</b><br /><ol><li>Download the Update Set attached to this blog and extract the contents.</li><li>In your instance, click on <b>Retrieved Update Sets</b> under System Update Sets Application Menu Item.</li><li>Click on <b>Import Update Set from XML</b></li><li>Browse to the UpdateSetBackVersionGeneratorv1.X.xml file you downloaded and click Upload.</li><li>Now click on <b>UpdateSet Back Version Generator v1.X</b> to open the details of it.</li><li>Click <b>Preview Update Set</b></li><li>Click <b>View Update Set Preview List</b> to see if you have any conflicts to resolve</li><li>Once you check click the browser's back button then click on <b>Return to Update Set Record</b></li><li>Click <b>Commit Update Set</b></li><li>When this finishes you should have a UI Action named <b>Create Pre Calgary Version</b>.
