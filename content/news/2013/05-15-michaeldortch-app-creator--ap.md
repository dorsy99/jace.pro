<p>Finally. A platform that enables regular people to create meaningful business applications. Without coding, and without creating more work and pain for their colleagues in IT.<br/><br/>ServiceNow has announced its App Creator, which eases and speeds creation of custom applications on the ServiceNow Service Automation Platform. But App Creator is an evolution, not a revolution. ServiceNow customers have been building applications on the ServiceNow platform since shortly after it was introduced. And ServiceNow Chief Product Officer Fred Luddy blew people away at Knowledge12 when he built a live application on a live ServiceNow instance on stage in minutes.<br/><br/><br/><center><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1283-1830/jg.jpg"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="77" src="b621a042db9057049c9ffb651f961946.iix" width="432"/></a></center><br/><center><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-1283-1832/tr.jpg"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" height="79" src="5cfdff71dbd45fc03eb27a9e0f96193e.iix" width="432"/></a></center><br/> <br/><br/>With App Creator, part of the Calgary release of ServiceNow, users can design, develop, manage, publish, and retire custom applications. (For more details on App Creator's features, See Dan Turchin's fine blog post, <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.servicenow.com/blog/dturchin/p90x-so-2012-try-app-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"P90X? So 2012. Try the App Creator."</a> And App Creator makes all of these processes more streamlined and accessible. Which means even faster time to value for those folks building and deploying custom applications at their enterprises.<br/><br/>Folks such as Nicole Tate, Manager of Application Delivery and Support at MetroPCS. During the ServiceNow Webinar <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,86541f4e87bcc1c093db7b2d7d434d9a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Planning for Success with Custom Applications"</a>, she said that she'd written an application for her HR colleagues in about a day, and rolled it out in about a week. Now THAT's time to value!<br/><br/>App Creator is the latest incarnation of Fred Luddy's original vision of a platform upon which regular people can build meaningful applications. And the current take on Fred's vision aligns with the views of other influencers, including Gartner's Jarod Greene. In his March 2013 blog post, <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blogs.gartner.com/jarod-greene/2013/03/12/platform-to-the-people/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Platform to the People"</a> Jarod wrote this.<br/><br/>"Lately, I've been an IT Service Support Management analyst thrown into many Platform-as-a-Service discussions, due largely in part to the success of ServiceNow….ITSSM tools, automating IT management processes as an essential function, are enabling an easy way to build upon their core solution to expand the system of use to new, and even unintended, end uses….For the record, I believe in platform for the people. The platform puts the power into the hands of the larger pool of innovation in the world — the I&amp;O [infrastructure and operations] shops who use these tools each and every day. Add mass collaboration to the equation, and the possibilities are truly endless."<br/><br/>What Jarod said.<br/><br/>If you're a ServiceNow customer, schedule your upgrade to the Calgary release with your ServiceNow representative.
