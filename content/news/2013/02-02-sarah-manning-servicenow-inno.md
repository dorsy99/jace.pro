<p>It's time again to see what the most innovative ServiceNow customers have been up to this year. As you may know, we are in search of the world's most amazing business and IT applications created on the ServiceNow platform. Did you create the next <strong>ServiceNow Innovation of the Year?</strong><br/><br/>Knowledge 13 is coming up, and part of the event's activities will be to highlight our innovative finalists and vote for the winner. The Innovation of the Year award goes to a single ServiceNow customer that has extended ServiceNow above and beyond in both creative and pragmatic ways. In addition to a great prize, the winner receives serious kudos from peers for a whole year.<br/><br/>Here in the ServiceNow Community, we'll keep you informed every step of the way. We will summarize entries, highlight past innovations that stood out, promote our finalists and inspire each other with frequent posts. <br/><br/>And we need you. Your thoughts and opinions count, so talk to us. Comment on entries, share ideas, and support your creative peers. We want to hear from everyone.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, NOW is the time to <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://knowledge.service-now.com/k13/k13_innovation.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">submit your Innovation of the Year entry</a>.
