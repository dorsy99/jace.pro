<p>Knowledge13 was a real blast. There were so many opportunities for its 4,000 guests to experience and learn new perspectives on how ServiceNow can be applied. When it comes to technology platforms, it is easy to get stuck in the habit of how your company or organization has been doing things. That is where awesome conferences like Knowledge come in, featuring a wealth of insight and experience from a wide range of customers in addition to our own professionals.<br /><br />It is amazing how the purpose of a product can change as people are exposed to different ways it can be used. Conferences like <a title="mmunity.servicenow.com/knowledge13-community-portal" href="http://community.servicenow.com/knowledge13-community-portal">Knowledge13</a> give you a chance to see the possibilities, tweaks, and changes you can make--both to ServiceNow and to your organizations using ServiceNow as a catalyst.<br /><br />Anyhow, this blog post is dedicated to helping you, as a Knowledge attendee, use what you have learned. Now that it is post-Knowledge, I am sure you want to impress your boss or even your boss's boss with all of the awesome ideas you have brought home with you.<br /><br /><br /><center><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="e29ef402db5013043eb27a9e0f961912.iix" /></center><br /><br /><br /><b>5 ways to utilize your Knowledge trip:</b><br /><ol><li><b>Get on your Community account and start answering questions.</b> You are equipped with all of this new-found knowledge, it would be a shame to waste it.</li><li><b>Check out your newly-joined <a title="mmunity.servicenow.com/og" href="http://community.servicenow.com/og">SNUG</a></b>. If you can't get enough ServiceNow, check out what the SNUG in your area is doing and when you can attend the next ServiceNow gathering. Contact your local SNUG manager if you'd like to help or get on the agenda.</li><li><b>Review your notes</b>. Whether you are traditional and brought the good ol' spiral notebook and pen or your iPad, it is always good to review what you learned so you can impress all of your colleagues that didn't get to go. You can also download the presentation decks on the Knowledge13 portal in the "Agenda Builder" section in case you want to share specific slides.</li><li><b>Stay connected</b>. If you collected any business cards or met anyone influential or special, send them an email. Even if you forgot to get their business card, do some digging. You would be surprised at how easy it is to find a person's contact info on the web. This will refresh their memory of you from the event and help establish a relationship outside of the event.</li><li><b>Connect with them on LinkedIn and Twitter</b>. These two sites are my favorite for business networking. <a title="witter.com/servicenow" href="https://twitter.com/servicenow">Twitter</a> is great for communicating with companies and business professionals more casually and <a title="din.com/company/servicenow" href="www.linkedin.com/company/servicenow">LinkedIn</a> lets you get more in depth with their business. Connect on these social platforms to help transition your friendship from Knowledge to one that can be used as a part of your network every day.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><br />If you missed out on this year's Knowledge, you can still catch <a title="t.ly/knowledge13" href="http://bit.ly/knowledge13">Frank's opening keynote</a>, exclusive <a title="nowledge.servicenow.com/k13/hub.do" href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/k13/hub.do">behind-the-scenes interviews</a>, and <a title="mmunity.servicenow.com/knowledge13-community-portal" href="http://community.servicenow.com/knowledge13-community-portal">Knowledge13 blog posts</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><font size="6">See you all next year for Knowledge14 in San Francisco!</font></center></li></ol></p>
