<p>If you've worked with ServiceNow much at all, you're probably familiar with the capability provided to search knowledge from the incident form, and then attach the knowledge article back to the originating incident. This behavior is extremely useful and <a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Administering_Knowledge_Search#Customizing_the_.22Attach_to_Task.22_Button" title="Knowlege Attach to Incident Button Customization" target="_blank">can be customized if needed</a>. One complaint I've heard about this behavior before is that it posts back the entire contents of the knowledge article into the 'Comments' field on the incident. The advantage to this setup is that the solution then gets sent directly out to the end user in their email, but it also comes with a disadvantage since the user never actually has to interact with the Knowledge Base or even know that they could have found their solution there. <br /><br />One way to better promote knowledge use among your end user community (while still providing useful solutions) is to customize this default attach behavior to send a link to the knowledge article rather than the full text in the Incident 'Comments' field. In this article, I'll show you how that can be done!<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/script-includes-scripting/attach-knowledge-link/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/AttachKnowledgeLink-300x122.jpg" alt="Attach Knowledge Link" width="300" height="122" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4755" /></a><br /><h3>Learn more at ServiceNowGuru!</h3></center><br /><!--break--></p>
