<p>I'm a big fan of game shows and when I was a full-time trainer, I used to incorporate games like Amazing Race and Jeopardy into my classes. If I gave you the answer of 59%, which one of the following would you think is the correct question:</p><p><br/><br/>a.What is the percentage of respondents who say they are interested in taking an Advanced Admin course from ServiceNow?<br/>b.What is the percentage of respondents who say they are interested in taking an Asset Management course from ServiceNow?<br/>c.What is the amount of body fat Andy will end up with after a year if he continues to eat a tub of his favorite ice cream every night?<br/><br/><strong>The answer is B.</strong><br/>NOTE: 63% of respondents were interested in Adv Admin. And for the record, my favorite ice cream is Chocolate Malted Crunch from Rite Aid (known as Thrifty's when I was growing up).<br/><br/>This was data that was collected for us from a longitudinal survey of our former SysAdmin students. Thanks to all of you who were part of this past quarter's survey. It was great to see this figure and we're glad we could respond immediately with a 3-day Asset Management course for our customers.<br/><br/>We are continuing to build out our technical training curriculum so if you have requests, please do not hesitate to send me an email or simply comment below.
