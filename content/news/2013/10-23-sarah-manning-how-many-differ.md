<p>In a growing organization, or one that simply aims to evolve, IT service requirements change constantly. As long as it is agile and can adapt quickly, IT will be successful at meeting those needs. <br /><br />But as IT's customer base expands beyond the traditional service desk to various departments across the enterprise, a new set of challenges may arise. With the right service automation system, IT is limitless in the amount of service relationships it can manage and improve across the business.<br /><br /><a title="w.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,254bf8b60a0a3cc801c5445e17a404ef" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,254bf8b60a0a3cc801c5445e17a404ef">The University of San Francisco manages service relationships</a> for the communications and marketing, university development and fundraising, as well as budget intake departments through IT. The platform is flexible enough to allow IT to offer custom systems for different types of service requests around campus, like Admissions and the One-Stop student registration kiosk. Plus, a special Budget Assist application has gained visibility at the University cabinet level. IT at USF can expand its customer base as it wants, improving at least six different service relationships around campus. <br /><br /><a title="w.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,5dbcac4bff578040d4d9f62c297efe65" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,5dbcac4bff578040d4d9f62c297efe65">CERN is one of the most innovative organizations in the world</a> and runs its entire city on ServiceNow. In just 12 weeks, over 21,324 IT requests and 21,890 general business requests from across the CERN city were powered through IT. From emergency services, carpool and rental services, to cleaning, and locks and keys, more than 10 different departments rely on IT to manage their service relationships. <br /><br />Every department in the enterprise is a service provider, yet very few have matured the service model to the level of enterprise IT. Savvy IT leaders view this as an opportunity to leverage IT service expertise and enable the business in new, highly impactful ways. IT can, and should, extend beyond the walls of the traditional help desk to improve different service relationships throughout the company. With the right combination of technology and processes, IT's sphere of influence can only grow.
