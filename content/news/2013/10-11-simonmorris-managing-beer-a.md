<p>Yesterday a team from NCC Solutions, a Munich based ServiceNow partner, sat down to build an application to demonstrate to the attendees of the NowForum event in Mainz.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="Screen Shot 2013-10-09 at 16.39.34.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="51447f71db10d3041dcaf3231f9619ec.iix" style="height: 350px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p>The CreateNow Custom Application Hackathon is an opportunity for both customers and partners to demonstrate their skills and for ServiceNow to show the capabilities of the platform.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The team from NCC certainly took advantage and met the challenge. Their application - built in 6 hours from start to demonstration - shows how flexible our platform is in terms of form based data capture, workflow, social and content management.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>WiesNow is an application to manage the logistics behind the Oktoberfest beer festival - although Melhem was keen to point out that it could work for any large event.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It allows visitors to reserve tables at a festival, order food and interact using social media. Event managers can see the availability and capacity of tents, fulfil orders quickly and apply Service Management principles to their work</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I sat down with the team and ran through the application with them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><object height="360" width="480"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/LRCvcV87u1w?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"/><embed allowfullscreen="true" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LRCvcV87u1w?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480"></embed></object></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>We were visited during the day by Fred, Frank and Arne who were impressed by the progress the team had made during a short amount of time.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a title="witter.com/search?q=%23ServiceNow&src=hash" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ServiceNow&amp;src=hash">#ServiceNow</a> founder and Chief Product Officer Fred Luddy hangs with the CreateNow hackathon team from <a title="witter.com/nccsolutions" href="https://twitter.com/nccsolutions">@nccsolutions</a> <a title="co/ERdyCLTJXz" href="http://t.co/ERdyCLTJXz">pic.twitter.com/ERdyCLTJXz</a></p>— Simon Morris (@Simo_Morris) <a title="witter.com/Simo_Morris/statuses/387926668066570240" href="https://twitter.com/Simo_Morris/statuses/387926668066570240">October 9, 2013</a></blockquote><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Great!
