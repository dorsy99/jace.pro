TechNow is FOR technical resources, presented BY technical resources as only Chuck and Andrew can. We'd like your input.<br /><br />We want to keep bringing you information you find useful. What's on your mind? Do you want to see some of Calgary's new features? Orchestration? Discovery? Extending tables? User interface tips? Challenges you face in your implementation? Service catalog? Getting started on a new app or process? Let us know by leaving us comments here and we'll get it on our list of opportunities.<br /><br />We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />--Chuck &amp; Andrew<br /><br />P.S. Thank you everyone for the kind words at Knowledge 13! We're glad you find TechNow helpful and entertaining.<br /><br /><!--break--></p>
