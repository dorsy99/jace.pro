<p>To all,<br /><br />I hope everyone is doing well. If you have not heard, Calgary has released for Controlled Availability! I have not heard of a firm general availability release date yet but I believe they were targeting release before or by Knowledge - which will be here before you know it. Here is the Wiki link to the release notes for more information: http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Calgary_Release_Notes <br /><br />Also, if you haven't registered for Knowledge yet, you still have time. Based on registration so far, there should be a great showing from the Missouri customer base - I look forward to see everyone out there, it will be a great event!! https://knowledge.servicenow.com/k13/k13_home.do <br /><br />Thanks and talk to you all soon,<br />B</p>
