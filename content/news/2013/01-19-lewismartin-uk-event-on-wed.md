<p>On Wednesday, 23rd January it's the UK User Group event. It's going to be epic... Almost 100 people are expected from across the UK and from a great mix of sectors. There will be old and new customers sharing their ServiceNow stories and experiences. To make it even more exciting, the event is being held at The Tower of London, with the world famous Beefeaters. During lunch we have a tour organised to go and see the Crown Jewels. There is also a free prize draw for all the customers, where they can win a great prize. The networking opportunities will go on long into the evening with a drinks event at a near by London Pub! Best of all, this this all free to those attending. Look forward to seeing some of you there next week.</p>
