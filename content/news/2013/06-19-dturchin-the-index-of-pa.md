<p><b>The Index of PaaS Activity (IPA)</b> is our way of measuring the industry's progress toward app nirvana. <img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="a452418adbd01b04ed6af3231f96195d.iix" height="100" width="150" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3" />We introduced it last November and have seen it ebb and flow over the past eight months. <br /><br />It's not exactly a chicken in every pot but we think all organizations deserve a modern platform, a development environment designed for mere mortals, and apps users love. We think this PaaS phenomenon is creating a fundamental shift in how work gets done that will be every bit as influential as mobile, social, or big data. <br /><!--break--><br />We're chronicling the rise of PaaS by looking at key metrics each month that indicate where it's headed and how quickly it will get there. They include stock prices, job postings, tweets, headlines, and search traffic.<br /><br /><b>IPA</b> went all 1999 on us in April then reversed course and did a 2001 in May. The index <i><b><font color="red">shed 21.3%</font></b></i> during a period when the broad-based S&amp;P 500 was <i><b><font color="green">up 2.1%</font></b></i> and the tech-heavy NASDAQ was <i><b><font color="green">up 3.7%</font></b></i>. <br /><br />PaaS-related stock prices and job postings weigh heavily on the index and both were down during the period. PaaS headlines in tech pubs (<i><b><font color="green">+35.7%</font></b></i>) and tweets (<i><b><font color="green">+13.9%</font></b></i>) were up which kept the index from falling further. <a title="gaom.com/2013/06/13/breaking-savvis-to-buy-appfog/" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/06/13/breaking-savvis-to-buy-appfog/" rel="lightframe">M&amp;A activity</a>, the <a title="w.zdnet.com/red-hat-opens-openshift-paas-cloud-for-business-7000016635/" href="http://www.zdnet.com/red-hat-opens-openshift-paas-cloud-for-business-7000016635/" rel="lightframe">public launch of RedHat OpenShift</a>, and silly season for <a title="w.zdnet.com/dissecting-the-converged-cloud-news-from-hp-discover-what-it-means-7000016765/" href="http://www.zdnet.com/dissecting-the-converged-cloud-news-from-hp-discover-what-it-means-7000016765/" rel="lightframe">enterprise tech confabs</a> all contributed to the glut of PaaS-related news.</p>
