<p>This week I'm blogging from Knowledge13 in Las Vegas! So far it's been a fantastic conference with lots of great content and it's been fun to meet with so many people interested in improving their ServiceNow implementation. I'm really looking forward to the Fred Luddy keynote this morning. Jacob Andersen and I are here representing our ServiceNow consulting company, <a href="http://www.crossfuze.com" title="Crossfuze solutions" target="_blank">Crossfuze Solutions</a> and would love to talk with any of you who could benefit from working with the most experienced ServiceNow implementation and integration consultants in the industry. Stop by the BDNA booth (Booth 1216) during any of the expo times to visit with us and see some of our world-class <a href="http://www.crossfuze.com/solutions/turnkey-solutions" title="Crossfuze Turnkey Solutions" target="_blank">Incident, Problem, Knowledge, Change, Catalog, CMS, and Asset Management solutions</a>! I'll also be participating in a sold out panel presentation at 1:40 today where we'll discuss the importance of data quality in a ServiceNow implementation.<br /><br />Okay, enough of the high-pressure sales pitch :). This morning I saw a post on the ServiceNow community asking how to display a google map based on a ServiceNow location record. I think this is a fantastic idea and I decided to see if I could come up with a couple of solutions for it this morning. In this post I'll show you how you can set up a UI Action or UI Macro link to pop open a Google Map window based on any location record in your ServiceNow instance!<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-actions-system-ui/open-google-map-location-record/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/LocationGoogleMapMacro-300x194.jpg" alt="Location Google Map UI Macro" width="300" height="194" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4913" /></a><br /><br /><h3>Click here to learn more at ServiceNowGuru.com!</h3><br /></center><br /><!--break--></p>
