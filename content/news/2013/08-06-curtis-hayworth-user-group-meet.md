<p>I'd like to get a user group meeting scheduled for September. There are many updates to ServiceNow that I'd like to bring in some product managers, especially around the new Mirror 42 functionality for advanced analytics. <br /><br />Is anyone interested in hosting a meeting in Des Moines or Omaha in September? <br /><br />Curtis</p>
