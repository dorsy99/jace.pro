<p>Thank you everyone who attended last week's UK ServiceNow User Group, hosted by Focus Group Europe at the Magic Circle in London, for making it such a great event.<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed the event as much as myself and my fellow committee members did and picked up some useful information and contacts on the day. <br /><br />Thank you also to those who indicated that they would like to join the Organising Team; I look forward to formally welcoming you to the team when we start planning for the next event, which is provisionally set for late March 2014.<br /><br />If you have any feedback or suggestions from the day, please post a reply to the blog and a member of the Organising Team will respond if required. <br /><br />As mentioned above, the next event will be held in the Spring 2014, so on behalf of the Organising Team can I wish you all a good Christmas and a Happy New Year!<br /><br />Shane.</p>
