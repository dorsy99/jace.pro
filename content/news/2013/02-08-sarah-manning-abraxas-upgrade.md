<p>When enterprise IT uses legacy, on-premise software to meet its service management needs, upgrades cost both time and money. Plus, "meeting needs" is very subjective. Sure, the tool functions, but does it pave the way for future growth and innovation?<br /><br />Abraxas Informatik AG, a Swiss Information and Communication Technologies enterprise for public administrations and organizations, faced the choice to invest in a costly upgrade or replace its existing tool completely. The company wanted to provide a self-service experience to end users and efficient order processing for customers with the help of a flexible, cloud platform — which the existing software could not provide without straying from budgetary boundaries.<br /><br />Thus began the search for a solution with higher functionality and flexibility, greater simplicity and self-service capabilities and lower ownership costs. Since only a cloud service could meet these demands, SaaS for IT service automation from ServiceNow, and implementation services from partner <a title="w.aspediens.com/" href="http://www.aspediens.com/">Aspediens</a>, became the natural choice. Implementation began in December, 2011, with a successful go-live at the beginning of July, 2012 with incident, change, problem, asset management, request fulfillment and IT self-service. <br /><br />Now, ServiceNow can be found in production throughout the entire company. Both internal and external customer projects benefit from the platform. IT already utilizes ServiceNow today in more ways than they could after working with their legacy tool for four years. <br /><br />And there's more:<br />•<b>Increased agility:</b> IT is faster and more flexible and dynamic. Errors are avoided and accuracy maintained;<br />•<b>Expanding services:</b> Enhanced self-service is already integrated throughout the ServiceNow platform and can be used quickly and easily; <br />•<b>Skyrocketing autonomy:</b> All employees and managers perform data analysis without having to contact a system administrator. Independence has never been so high. <br /><br />Looking forward, Abraxas plans to automate more IT and business processes to further drive business. With ServiceNow, the company can support a wider segment of customers and will capitalize on this capability by working to acquire more clients in the private sector. That's innovation and business growth at its best. <br /><br />See Abraxas in the news:<br /><a title="w.it-business.de/cloud-computing/weiteres/articles/391706" href="http://www.it-business.de/cloud-computing/weiteres/articles/391706">IT-Business</a><br /><a title="w.searchcloudcomputing.de/services/system-management/articles/391513" href="http://www.searchcloudcomputing.de/services/system-management/articles/391513">Search Cloud Computing</a><br /><a title="w.searchdatacenter.de/themenbereiche/cloud/services/articles/391514" href="http://www.searchdatacenter.de/themenbereiche/cloud/services/articles/391514">Search Data Center</a></p>
