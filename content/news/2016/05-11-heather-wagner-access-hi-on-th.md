<p>With Helsinki came a more focused and user-friendly vision for how we at ServiceNow conduct customer communication and service from HI. As NOWonNOW implies, we drink our own Kool-aid. We utilize the same tools we provide to customers within our own interfaces. This time we are bringing the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=52dde6e9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619db">Service Portal</a> interface we provide on HI from your desktop, to your mobile device. That's right, you can now handle incidents and communications between your organization and us from anywhere you have an internet connection. Waiting in line to board a flight and need to check the status of an incident you opened? Pull it up on your iPhone. Riding in the carpool and need to respond to a comment left on your ticket? Pull it up on your iPhone.</p><p></p><p>I was on my flight home the other day when another passenger noticed the ServiceNow logo on my backpack and asked if I work for the company. I said yes, and as usually happens in this situation, I received a bouquet of praise about our platform from a customer. In this case it was the mobile app. "I just love to be able to approve things wherever I am!" I told him that not only that, but you can log into multiple instances through the same app! With the tap of a finger, you can quickly switch between your instance and HI, for example.</p><p></p><p>Mobile is so important in this day and age. It feels like more than ever we are on the go. Regardless of how little time we are stationary we still need to manage, oversee, and collaborate on things that make the team, office and work place function smoothly. This is why we have brought HI to your mobile device.</p><p><img   alt="HI service portal mobile.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="0a03604adb90d704ed6af3231f961978.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 515px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>You can <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Activating_ServiceNow_Plugins" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Activating_ServiceNow_Plugins">activate a plugin</a>, <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547276" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547276">unlock users</a>, even <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0538835" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0538835">request a zboot</a>.
