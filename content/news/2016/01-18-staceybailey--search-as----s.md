<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Many thanks to </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=8a609a69db581fc09c9ffb651f961924" style="line-height: 1.5;">Michelle Corona</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> for pointing this one out!</span></p><p></p><p>See <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/administer/contextual_search/task/t_SearchAsDifferentUser.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/administer/contextual_search/task/t_SearchAsDifferentUser.html">Search as different user</a> in Product Documentation.</p><p></p><p>As Service Desk agents, we like to leverage knowledge articles to support users.   Very often, this can reduce handle time significantly for cases. However, when supporting many customers / geographies / subsidiaries out of a single instance, it may be challenging to identify appropriate articles to share.   Often, the Service Desk agent has broad access to articles though only a subset may be applicable to the case at hand.</p><p></p><p>In the past (Pre-Eureka), I've seen articles for resetting a password at customer A's site shared out with Customer B users instead.   Other than via using naming conventions, it was difficult to tell if a particular end user was entitled to see a particular article.   Separate knowledge bases have certainly helped with this issue, though we still have the challenge of knowing if the customer user has appropriate roles to view articles.</p><p></p><p>Within Geneva, we now have the ability to display search results as both the current user as well as an alternate user. </p><p></p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" src="a9bd5402dbdc9704ed6af3231f96195f.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p></p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>Service Desk Agent searches and sees all articles visible based on rights and visibility.   In a second tab, he also sees articles visible to the caller / requester.</li><li>HR manager searches the HR knowledge base and sees all articles available to him as a manager.   In a second tab, she also sees articles visible to the requester.</li></ul><p></p><p>This allows us to be sure articles we share will be visible to and applicable to the end user.</p>
