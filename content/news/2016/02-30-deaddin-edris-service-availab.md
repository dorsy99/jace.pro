<p>In our last blog post, we introduced the three phases of the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=177ce2e1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961962">Service Operations Maturity Model</a>, and the different solutions ServiceNow has to help customers move through it.</p><p></p><p>In this month's blog, we're going to focus on Phase 2 — Availability — and the solutions that help you achieve success in this phase. We work closely with a lot of IT organizations across many different industries. This gives us a front-row view into the challenges they encounter daily when it comes to ensuring services are available. When business services are disrupted, a company can be affected in two areas: cost and reputation. The one thing executives care most about is ensuring business services are available and do not have any impact on the business or customers.</p><p></p><p>CIOs and IT Operations teams are living in constant fear of how to mitigate issues related to service outages. If an outage occurs, whether it's a data breach or human error, fixing it usually involves a lot of time due to a high volume of events associated with the outage, manual processes, lack of service-awareness and multiple teams involved to remediate the problem. This can cost the organization lost revenue, profit, customers, and impact a firm's reputation — something no CIO wants to have happen on their watch.</p><p></p><p>Organizations may not realize how the thousands of events that their IT infrastructure generates per day are related to critical business services. This leaves them depending on blind luck to keep the lights on in their data center, and with no real way to prioritize them based on business criticality and revenue impact.</p><p></p><p>Enter <a title="w.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/datasheets/ds-ServiceWatch-insight.pdf" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/datasheets/ds-ServiceWatch-insight.pdf">ServiceWatch Insight</a> — helping to ensure service visibility and availability with Discovery, Service Mapping, and Event Management applications.
