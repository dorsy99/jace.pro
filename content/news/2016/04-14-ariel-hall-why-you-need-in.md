<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">You've been sold on the necessity of enterprise reporting software. In your fast-paced IT work environment, its value is undeniable. Neither you nor anyone on your team has the time to sit in front of a spreadsheet, crunching numbers and manually creating graphs and charts when the boss asks about quarterly IT support performance. You need something that is fast, accurate and easily configurable, because sometimes those questions change their scope. But have you thought about the difference between your run-of-the-mill, disconnected reporting software versus true in-platform reporting?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>A New Standard of Reporting Excellence</strong></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The beauty of in-platform reporting is that it gives you assurance the data behind your dashboards reflects real time circumstances. While 3rd party reporting software tools are capable of some great things, you'll never achieve the same level of accuracy that in-platform reporting provides. With native reporting like what's found in ServiceNow Express, your dashboards change as your data changes. As soon as a ticket is submitted or a request is closed, your metrics will reflect those updates. Moreover, you can change the mold of your reports and dashboards on the fly. As fields are added to tables and new metrics of interest are identified, you can modify your existing reports to adapt to business needs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Get Up Close and Personal</strong><a href="https://express.servicenow.com/support/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Report-Drilldown-Clip.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-11496" style="color: #278efc; background: transparent;"><img alt="In-platform Reporting Drill Down" class="wp-image-11496 alignright jive-image" height="287" src="https://express.servicenow.com/support/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Report-Drilldown-Clip.gif" style="border-color: #cccccc; margin: 5px 0px 20px 20px; float: right; height: 287px; width: 528.412px;" width="528"/></a></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Perhaps one of the best, most valuable features of in-platform reporting is the ability to drill down into any metric with the click of a mouse. Your clicks will take you to the live data that makes up those lists, charts, and graphs, so you can get to the details when you need them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">And while your initial engagement with reporting may have stemmed from a one-time ask to provide a snapshot of performance, in-platform reporting can guide you on a regular cadence, too. Make your dashboards personal by feeding them data specific to your role and areas of ownership. That way, any time you log in to your ServiceNow Express instance, you'll be brought up to speed with the latest action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Share the Love</strong></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Maybe you've snagged the title of "Reporting Guru" within your group and others want you to keep them informed, too. Not a problem. With scheduled reports, transferring information to others is a breeze. Just configure the desired report to send to a specific system role or distribution list at whatever frequency they require. More automation = more sleep for you. Score!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #666666; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Even better, you don't need to spend time and energy developing every single report. ServiceNow Express lets you see immediate benefits from the system with more than 150 bundled reports and dashboards at your disposal.
