Sunday morning, bright-and-early we started.   It was a great class.   We had around 40 people for two days.   Needless to say we covered a LOT of material.   The ServiceNow Application Creation Training team did a great job with the materials and logistics.   We had all been preparing for the class for a couple of months; it was fun presenting at last!   We finished Monday evening.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="teaching at pre-conf.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="efbf70c6db9c9344e9737a9e0f961981.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Tuesday, May 17th</strong></p><p></p><p>Viewed the opening ceremony: huge, amazing, so many people, and everybody was there for ServiceNow!</p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img   alt="opening session_small.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="944ffffddbd45fc03eb27a9e0f96193e.iix" style="height: auto;"/></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(Heading out from breakfast to the opening ceremony of the conference, wow!)</span></p><p></p><p>That day, I had my first of two scheduled MVP Table Topics lunch sessions.   My topic:</p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/knowledge16.servicenowevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2525">17TA05 - Debugging Server-Side Script</a></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">An opportunity to discuss the available approaches and best practices when debugging Script Includes, Workflows, Scheduled Jobs, etc.</p><p></p><p>I was surprised when I found I had a full table!   What more could you ask?
