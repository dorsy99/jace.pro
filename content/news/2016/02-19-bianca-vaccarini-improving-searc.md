<p>Search is very important when looking for the answers you need. Â  That being said, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=5e7d6269dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619bf">improving the search</a> on <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/common/reference/Welcome.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/common/reference/Welcome.html">docs.servicenow.com</a> is one of our main priorities to get you the answers to your questions. Coming spring, you can look forward to a new search experience on the product documentation site.</p><p></p><p>It's confusing to have the search results off to the left in the current site so we're going to make them much more visible-- search results will have their own page.</p><ul><li>On the Search Results page, we're adding filters so you can refine the search results by version and/or by product.</li><li>You'll be able to bookmark your favorite searches because your results, with or without filters selected, will have a unique URL.</li><li>Each search result will highlight the search phrase and indicate which categories apply to the content.</li></ul><p></p><p>Here is an example of the first of many changes coming to the documentation:</p><p><img   alt="improved doc servicenow search.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="19d67bfddbd05704ed6af3231f961924.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 397px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>This is the first of many changes to come based on feedback we received from all of our awesome community users and product documentation enthusiasts. Stay tuned as we share more updates on what is to come. Also, if you want to help shape the future of the doc site, feel free to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=a40e2a2ddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619f2">send us feedback!</a></p>
