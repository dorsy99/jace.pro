Myke is a Director of our Security business unit and has been with ServiceNow since October 2011. Today, he will be delivering a presentation at 11.30 am, entitled </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>ServiceNow: Closing the Gap Between IT and Security for Better Security Response.</strong></span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><em>So Mike, this is obviously a large event with lots to choose from for the 800 delegates around. Why should they attend your session later today?</em></span></p><p><img   class="image-2 jive-image" src="f15c40c2dbd09704ed6af3231f961939.iix" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18.6666660308838px; line-height: 31.1111125946045px; float: right; width: auto; height: auto;"/></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'First of all, because the title of my session is not overstated: there really is a gap between IT and Security in many organisations and its hurting the bottom line. The relationship between the two functions is like a sibling rivalry. The IT team usually is about 10 times bigger than the Security team, but one can't do without the other. The security team will call on the IT guys to address a major incident. IT looks at security for the expertise around threats and attacks and how to deal with them. But they are often disconnected and not enough in sync. Therefore, security doesn't have the right level of visibility into the operational systems and IT isn't trained to assess security threats. If they were more integrated, it would materially benefit both sides and the business they both support. That's where ServiceNow can help.'</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><em>So siblings, but quite different, right?</em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'Yes, each look at the world through different eyes. IT is about service management, Security is about CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. A simple example I often use: If the corporate website is down because of an attack, IT would treat it as a P1 exercise, bending sideways to get it back up and running, whereas Security would argue: "Well, one less asset to be hacked out there!" It's a joke, but it illustrates the difference in perspective between the two.'</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><em>Ok. And why is this problem getting more and more urgent?</em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'Well, because Security is still about fire fighting, about saving the day and being a hero. Less about following standardized process in dealing with threats, breaches, attacks. But the threat level is completely different from say 10 years ago, when you would maybe have one security incident a day. Nowadays, hundred or a thousand incidents a day are more common in large organisations.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'Hacking is a Billion-dollar business, with relatively low risk and high rewards for the culprits. And its an unfair game; IT and security teams within large institutions have to get it right all the time, whereas the attackers have to get it right only once. Therefore, we need to bring things together, so that Security can benefit from the structured way of working IT has established over the years in responding to incidents and problems; and IT benefits from the expertise the Security team has built in detecting and neutralizing threats — basically by fighting fires and being heroes every day.'</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><em>This maybe a bit simplistic, but: Why not just throw bodies at the issue and hire many more security pros?</em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'Simply because they're not available, they're just not there. In 2016, 1 Million security positions worldwide can't be filled. So we need the teams that we do have to cooperate in improving our overall security posture.'</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><em>Right, and where does ServiceNow come in?</em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'In providing the platform, the structured workflows and the in-platform analytics IT and Security need to get on top of things. We introduced applications for incident response, remediation and visualization of the security posture. We are currently helping our customers implement this technology and the first results are overwhelmingly positive. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'I talked to a UK customer earlier today and he literally said they were surprised to see how much immediate value our solutions brought to the organisation. Value in terms of insight and automation around threats and attacks. We're not being perceived as some ITIL vendor doing a bit of security on the side — instead they instantly sensed that it was purposefully built for security, and now they want to change their approach to Security Operations altogether and capitalize on ServiceNow.'</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><em>Myke, I'm sure that after your session at 11.30am, people will want to see some of this technology in action. What should they ask for in our stand?</em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">'For a strong example of our capabilities, ask the team to demonstrate how we respond to a reported phishing attempt, prioritizing a vulnerability based on the business context, not just on the severity of the vulnerability. Because a phishing attempt into our CFO's inbox should be treated differently from an attack on an interns Twitter account.'</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;"><em>Thanks Myke, have a great session later today!</em></span></p>
