<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">In Helsinki, Reporting released many exciting new and improved features that execute on our strategy of improved usability and user experience, making reporting easier and better. You can read about it in the <span style="color: #2275b8;"><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/r_ReportingRN.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/r_ReportingRN.html">Helsinki release notes</a></span>.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">In this blog, I'll focus on new or improved Reporting visualizations. As the Product Manager for the Reporting team, I'd like to share some information on key features we delivered for Helsinki, and why we chose to focus on those particular features. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">Of course we won't stop with Helsinki. Going forward, reporting will continue to provide features that will enable it to "be the face of your service". Not just the traditional "after the fact" reporting solutions (like summaries sent by PDF). We'll deliver features that better enable the use of Reporting widgets on a dashboard, as always in real time, and now also with auto refreshing.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">If configured right, reports can add massive value. Our goal is to make reports easy to create and consume, and where possible provide data visualizations that are actionable and help you improve your business.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">And now, the new &amp; improved visualizations:</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>New map report visualization</strong></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">With the new Map report you can plot your data on a geographical map either as specific data points or as a heatmap. You can drill into other reports or click to a view level deeper in the map. Use one of the many maps delivered out of the box, or add custom map - it's all possible. Your data really comes alive when displayed on a map, enabling you to see how data is geographically distributed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img   alt="Maps.jpg" class="image-4 jive-image" src="7f81bb71db9c93041dcaf3231f96199b.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>New and improved Calendar reports</strong></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">The changes we made to calendar in Helsinki to provide a more usable, modern experience - similar to what you find Outlook, iCal, and Google calendar.   Based on many requests we improved and added functionality, such as multi-day events, more intuitive navigation, persistent filters, and much more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img   alt="Calendar.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="5add898edb54130468c1fb651f96191c.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Auto refreshing of single score reports</strong></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">Last but definitely not least, when you add a single score widget that uses count aggregation to a dashboard or homepage you can now configure it refresh in real time — with zero performance degradation. The data in your ServiceNow platform is always real time, and now your single score reports can be too! This feature is great for, for example, call center or support dashboards, or any other dashboard a count of scores is important!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;"><img   alt="Dashboard_single_score.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" src="927b284edb94dfc068c1fb651f9619c3.iix" style="height: auto;"/></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">As previously mentioned, these are only a few highlights from the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/r_ReportingRN.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/r_ReportingRN.html">Helsinki</a> release. We also changed, added, improved many other features for platform reporting. We're now focused on delivering great new features for the current release, and future releases to come. Leveraging our core platform capabilities, reporting will always be real time, with up-to-date data, and be the single source of the truth for your business. No risk of data loss with importing or exporting your data, and always honoring your data security model.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e;">Please feel free to share your thoughts, both on this post and the product improvements themselves. I look forward to hearing your feedback!</span></p>
