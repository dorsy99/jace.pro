<p>ServiceNow have made a change to the Orchestration application that could affect you if you are using the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-it-operations-management/page/administer/orchestration_activities/reference/r_RunPowershellActivity.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-it-operations-management/page/administer/orchestration_activities/reference/r_RunPowershellActivity.html">"Run PowerShell"</a> Orchestration Workflow Activity.</p><p></p><p>As of the Helsinki Release, we have deprecated the ability for you to use the "Run PowerShell"<strong> </strong>Activity, which was designed to control and automate the administration of Windows machines and applications. This is just a heads-up to ensure that anyone using the Orchestration Application(s) are aware of this change and can take steps to circumvent any issues accordingly.</p><p></p><p>In the the Fuji Release we introduced the "<a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/orchestration_activity_designer/concept/c_WorkflowActivityDesigner.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/orchestration_activity_designer/concept/c_WorkflowActivityDesigner.html">Orchestration Activity Designer</a>", and this can be used to essentially replace the "Run PowerShell" Activity.</p><p></p><ul><li>The Orchestration Activity Designer allows customers to construct reusable activities.</li><li>This means that activities created in the Activity Designer, can be re-used throughout different workflows, and share data between the activities.</li><li>Previously, the Run PowerShell commands would have been workflow specific, and one may have had to create the same Run PowerShell activities multiple times for different workflows.</li></ul><p></p><p>"Run PowerShell" is no longer available as a <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/using_workflows/concept/c_WorkflowActivities.html#c_WorkflowActivities" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/using_workflows/concept/c_WorkflowActivities.html#c_WorkflowActivities">Workflow Activity</a>. Customers are now able to create their own Custom PowerShell Activities by using the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/orchestration_activity_designer/concept/c_WorkflowActivityDesigner.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/orchestration_activity_designer/concept/c_WorkflowActivityDesigner.html">Orchestration Activity Designer</a>, and selecting the "<strong>PowerShell template.</strong>"<span style="color: #eb7a3d;"><br/></span></p><p><img   alt="WorkflowPowershellProviderActivity.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="c787cdc6db541b04ed6af3231f96194a.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 322px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>The Orchestration activity designer enables a user with either the workflow_admin or activity_creator role to construct reusable activities. This means that you can reuse custom activities throughout workflows and share data between activities. <span style="color: #eb7a3d;"><br/></span></p><p></p><p>Please Note: Although the OOB "Run PowerShell" activity has been deprecated as of the Helsinki Release, it will still work in existing Orchestration Workflows, is still supported, and can be added back into the Workflow Editor if required. However; for future compatibility, we would recommend that customers leverage the power of the Orchestration Activity Designer, going forward.</p>
