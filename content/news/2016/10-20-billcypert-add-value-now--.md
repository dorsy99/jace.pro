(the 3 ways)</strong></span></p><p></p><p>In "The Phoenix Project" the authors describe the underpinning principles of DevOps patterns as "The Three Ways."</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The First Way:   Flow<img   alt="DevOps-1stWay_v2.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="cb4ceccadb149304b322f4621f9619b2.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 116px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></strong></span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this way, the focus overall is throughput.   Therefore as you can imagine "Theory of Constraints" is a major factor.   As Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt points out in his book "The Goal", making a change to anywhere in the system that is not the constraint (or bottleneck) is cosmetic at best.   Instead we should focus on identifying the single constraint that dictates the flow, then working to remove this constraint, thereby improving the whole system.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Second Way:   Feedback Loops Amplified <img   alt="DevOps-2ndWay_v2.jpg" class="image-4 jive-image" height="154" src="6cdb084adb1c1344e9737a9e0f961913.iix" style="width: 519px; height: 153.729px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="519"/><br/></strong></span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Faster flow is great, but not at the expense of quality.   We must improve feedback &amp; visibility to realize the gains of faster flow. Reducing the time between iteration feedback and ensuring dev listens to the feedback are the key goals here.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Third Way:   Continual Learning<img   alt="DevOps-3rdWay_v2.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="2101bfb1db9c1fc03eb27a9e0f96198a.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 189px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></strong></span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a continuation of the second way, in the third way we seek to dramatically reduce not only the feedback cycle time but also the TTM (time to market) of our code by reducing its scope.   Think of how many micro pushes you could make in a day rather than a complete system upgrade every six months.   This also greatly reduces the risk as these micro changes can often be implemented on a reduced scale and flagged active only once we are comfortable we understand their impact.   In a failure scenario our risk is also greatly reduced as micro changes often affect a very limited scope of targets, therefore the rollback, if needed is not as impactful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another consideration is mastery coming from repetition.   If I stay in very traditional support role with a code drop twice a year over a 30 year career, then I am supporting 60 code drops in my entire career.   If I go with DevOps style micro code drops 5 times a month, then I get the experience gained over 30 years in just one year.   For believers in continuous iteration, this gives me more chance to learn and get better.</p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Adoption Challenges</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Challenges</strong></span></p><p>Breaks Business as Usual</p><p>Requires shared Dashboard / Tools</p><p>Transparent change tracking</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3 Keys to Success</strong></span></p><p>Usually restructuring of teams required (NOT EASY)</p><p>Communication is KEY!</p><p>Shared Views / Reporting — Do we see things the same way?</p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Add Value Now</strong></span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are many great tools out there from Jira, Jenkins, OnTime Scrum, Microsoft TFS to Puppet, Chef, Salt Stack and Ansible.   These are solid solutions and should be leveraged, but none of these tear down the walls between Dev &amp; Ops.   Dev may have automated app release, but are they just throwing releases over the same wall quicker?   Ops may have automation delivery, but do they truly understand the delivery pipeline?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is where ServiceNow gives visibility to the dependencies that are always there.   How much better would it be to have both sides of this looking at the same dashboard, as opposed to how we typically look at different dashboards based on your role, then wonder why the other person doesn't't see it our way?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Metrics Important to DevOps (btw - we cover them all in single pane of glass <span __jive_emoticon_name="wink" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="2868.2333984375_692.63330078125_16_16" src="/8.0.4.21bdc7e/images/emoticons/wink.png"></span> )<br/></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Mean Time between Deployments</span><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Average and Max Deployments per hour (or min, month, year, etc)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Deployment Lead Time</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Change Success Rate</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Task Time per Person</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Risk Score by Service</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Visibility and Accountability | How ServiceNow can help!</strong></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ServiceNow has been providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>visibility and accountability</strong></span> to organizations for a long time.   In the DevOps movement, we are ready today with the proven system you need to move forward, just give us a chance to show you.
