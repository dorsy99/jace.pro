<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><img   alt="timeline-support.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="385" src="554de37ddb18dfc0b322f4621f961915.iix" style="height: 385px; width: 984.573px;" width="985"/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #626262; font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It took about 90 years for Bell's phone to transform the customer support industry into a robust call center where operators handled calls from all over the world. Phone support had become ubiquitous by the time the World Wide Web emerged.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #626262;">Only 17 years had passed between the invention of real-time transaction processing with credit cards and the point when customers were able to conveniently contact support via email and chat clients. As the pace of life accelerated, mobile support and chat became the new standard users came to expect. They brought back the immediacy of human interaction to the Internet and allowed for instantaneous feedback and real-time engagement from any device, anywhere in the world.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #626262;">However, while we focus on our customers (and to be fair, customers are the driving force behind high standards), we tend to forget about our own employees who are still experiencing a bygone era: dialing 1-800 numbers, emailing a support team, and sitting back in their chairs waiting for a response... Even though service desk agents keep working harder by sending longer emails and spending more time on the phone assisting incoming requests, support organization ROI barely treads water!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #626262;">With our new </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=w9gi5pm6WjQ" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9gi5pm6WjQ">Connect Support</a> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #626262;">in Geneva we are ready to redefine the concept of customer support on the platform and help you move from an outdated Service Desk to </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a title="ww.servicenow.com/" href="https://www.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow</a></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #626262;">. This productivity tool comes as a part </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">of the <a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=w9gi5pm6WjQ" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9gi5pm6WjQ">Connect experience</a></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #626262;">, our new system of engagement that makes the platform real-time and provides employees with a new and better way of working.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #626262;">By drawing inspiration from consumer applications such as Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts, we built Connect Support in such a way that it looks, feels and works in a way familiar to both employees and end users (agents and requestors). It allows everyone to jump right in and use this powerful tool to provide and receive real-time support from any device, no matter where they are, and without any training. An intuitive user experience, powerful messaging functionality and integration with both Knowledge Base and Records significantly reduces turn around time on tickets by bringing down the amount of email exchanges and time spent on the phone. This means faster and better customer service for your organization and higher return on investment for your support teams. Given that one agent, on average, handles 3 chats in the amount of time they take to answer 1 phone call, expect your productivity to skyrocket with usage of ServiceNow Connect Support!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #626262;">Connect is included in the Geneva platform release as a plugin that is quick and easy to enable and configure. While Connect Chat provides powerful real-time collaboration inside records and among users, Connect Support makes your agents more productive and efficient by enabling them to resolve incoming requests faster and in real-time. As Samuel Hulick once said, "<em>People don't buy products; they buy better versions of themselves.</em>" Hence, give your employees what they expect and need â€” a better way to succeed and grow.</span></p>
