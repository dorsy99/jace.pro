<p>ServiceNow is a SaaS offering hosted in a high availability data center pair with industry leading uptime. But what does cloud architecture mean for your business? Primarily, it means that your IT desk technicians, internal users, and external customers do <strong>not</strong> need to acquire any hardware or software to access ServiceNow from any internet connected browser ready device.</p><p></p><p>What this also means, however, is that all additional functionalities offered by your browser can be utilized to integrate fluidly with your ServiceNow instance. In this example, we will look at adding a Google Chrome extension for <a title="ww.grammarly.com/" href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> that will allow us to spell/grammar check our work! Although this is just one example of utilizing the power of a cloud-based, browser-run solution, the opportunities of what browser add-ons/extensions you find useful are up to you to discover!</p><pre __default_attr="danger" __jive_macro_name="alert" alert="danger" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_alert" data-renderedposition="149_8_1177_43"><p>ServiceNow does not endorse this product; it is simply an example to illustrate the concept.</p></pre><h2>Using browser extensions for added instance functionality</h2><ol><li><p>Begin by opening your Google Chrome browser (downloadable <a title="upport.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en" style="color: #278efc; background: transparent;">here</a> if you do not currently use it) and navigating to the Chrome Web Store by simply 'googling' it.</p><p><a href="https://express.servicenow.com/support/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1chromewebstore.jpg" style="color: #278efc; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background: #ffffff;"><img alt="Utilizing Browsers Extensions/Add-Ons For Added Instance Functionality (Translations)" class="jive-image aligncenter wp-image-1271 size-full" height="363" src="https://express.servicenow.com/support/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1chromewebstore.jpg" style="border-color: #cccccc; margin: 5px auto 15px; display: block;" width="416"/></a></p></li><li><p>From within the Chrome Web Store, search for Grammarly to locate the Grammarly Spell Checker &amp; Grammar Checker.</p><p><img   alt="servicenow grammarly spell check.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="ca8cdc42db985304b322f4621f961961.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 87px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p></li><li><p>Navigate to your ServiceNow instance URL, and open any form that has String fields.
