Sometimes they also may need to know which order guide it came from.</p><p></p><p>There are really a couple of ways to track that. One would involve a variable set and some cascading variables, and the other is <a title="w.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/populate-order-guide-request-ticket/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/populate-order-guide-request-ticket/">this SNCGuru solution</a>. They both have drawbacks, but I usually lean towards the latter partially because I try to create as few variables as possible. It's not perfect as there's a use case where it doesn't end up capturing the order guide.</p><p></p><p>Today I posted that SNCGuru article as a response to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=06354f6ddbd8dbc01dcaf3231f9619ce">someone else's question</a> and got a new response. <a title="shouvik" __default_attr="35600" __jive_macro_name="user" _jive_internal="true" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="shouvik" data-renderedposition="194_663.5360107421875_68_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=d0121ee1dbd81fc09c9ffb651f9619e5">shouvik</a> made my day by linking to <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/task/t_OrderProcess.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/task/t_OrderProcess.html">this article</a>, and telling us that there is a feature in Helsinki that automatically captures the order guide and writes it to a field called Order guide on the requested item without the customer having to configure anything. I went ahead and tested in my Helsinki instance and, sure enough, the order guide field was populated with the order guide I used to order the items.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="ritms.PNG" class="image-1 jive-image" src="1e06ed06dbd0df048c8ef4621f9619fb.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 337px;"/></p><p></p><p>I figured I'd try to give it a bit more visibility as I've been working primarily in Helsinki for a while now and I try to stay on top of the newest releases and had no idea that this new functionality existed.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/task/t_OrderProcess.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/task/t_OrderProcess.html">Request an order guide</a></p>
