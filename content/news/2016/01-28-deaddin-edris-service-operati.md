<p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Last month in our <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/search.jspa?facet=content&amp;q=geneva*&amp;sort=relevanceDesc">Geneva launch</a>, we unveiled the new <a title="ww.servicenow.com/solutions/it-operations-management.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/it-operations-management.html">ServiceWatch family </a>— the industry's first fully integrated, cloud-based system that can efficiently determine the root cause of service issues, identify business impact and automate restoration of the service. This is the "service-aware" strategy that defines ServiceNow's approach to the $10B+ IT Operations Management (ITOM) market. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">With it, we developed a service operations maturity model, and three packages to help you move through the phases. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Rewind to an earlier blog post where we <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=b2cda2e9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961941">ITOM is a key factor in enhancing your investment in the ServiceNow platform</a>. With the Geneva launch, we have taken our solutions to yet another level to help you see more, do more and deliver more to your business. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">How do we set you up for success? You've already developed a service-oriented way of thinking through Service Management, thinking in the context of a service, rather than the infrastructure that makes it up. So why would your ITOM strategy be any different? It shouldn't — and our Geneva release helps you capitalize on that strategy. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">All investments we make in our ITOM solutions are about enhancing your ITSM deployment and creating an accurate service-aware CMDB — a single source of truth. The ServiceWatch suite is designed to help you do that, and guide you along the Service Operations Maturity model shown below. Which phase is your organization in? </span></p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" height="448" src="a0fb8d82db54130468c1fb651f96196b.iix" style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5; height: 448px; width: 746.666666666667px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="746"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Many of our customers find themselves in one, or several of these phases — whether individual projects that don't intersect, or the purposeful "pursuit of truth." </span><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Most are in phase 1 with bits of phase 2 and 3 scattered about.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Some realize the importance of establishing that single system of record, the source of truth, in order to gain visibility into assets and inventory. But what we've found is that infrastructure discovery alone does not help with true service availability. Most customers then embark on service mapping and then in phase 2, add infrastructure monitoring with various disparate tools to correlate their manually created service maps. Because of the disparate nature of these tools today, results are mixed. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">In phase 3, customers look to automate more, to speed up delivery and improve governance. They seek to free up resources through automation and self-service — all indicators of a truly mature organization, operating within the principles of service operations management.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The key to this model is that these solutions and approaches work together. That they draw off that single system of record to maximize their effectiveness, and speed resolution, delivery, and results.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">But don't just take it from us; our customers are a testament to how our solutions have provided them with value:</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>"Qualcomm's business moves at a fast pace — we can't afford to have business services go down, and worse, not get them up and running quickly once an issue occurs," said Dave Lindgren, senior director, IT, at <a title="ww.qualcomm.com/" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a>.
