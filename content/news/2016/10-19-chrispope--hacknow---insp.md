Cognizant really shines in this space. Working together through our partnership, we are inspiring hundreds of Developers to build the next generation of solutions on the ServiceNow Platform. In early November we are bringing together almost 1000 people for 9 hours of inspired coding and design.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">This is the 2nd time we have done this and based on the success of the first event, this one looks to be bigger than before. With an anticipated 250 teams, across 5 locations, we expect to see some remarkable efforts. The teams will be building on the latest and greatest ServiceNow release ever, Istanbul!</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Attendees are invited across all lines of business, not just IT.
