<p>During its major releases ServiceNow has had a change of policy regarding how they display graphical charts such as pie charts, bar charts etc. From version to version, the capabilities in reporting have evolved, Â  and 3D charts, which were once a MUST, when delivering reports only fell to the wayside.</p><p></p><h3>3D charts for all! Aspen through to Calgary:</h3><p>3D charts were used to display all reporting charts up until and including the Calgary release.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="3d charts aspen calgary dubmin.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" src="7a5b2186db54df048c8ef4621f961929.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 227px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>3D charts for some! Dublin:</h3><p>By default reports were displayed in 3D but this was modifiable by setting the <span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">glide.report.use_charting_v2 property to 'true'.</span></p><p></p><h3>2D charts by default! Eureka:</h3><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Following the release of the Eureka version, a change was implemented to ensure that charts were displayed in 2D by default. However this version also allows the option to revert back and use 3D charts by setting the <span style="color: #333333;">glide.report.use_charting_v2 property to false. If this property is not already active on the instance it can be<a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Scheduling_and_Publishing_Reports" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Scheduling_and_Publishing_Reports"> created and set to false</a> by an administrator.</span></span></p><p></p><h3>Good bye 3D charts. Fuji, Geneva and beyond:</h3><p>In Fuji a new improved report generator has been released with major improvements, however 3D charts are no longer possible with this new version.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="3d charts fuji geneva.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="c31b3ffddbdcdf04e9737a9e0f961978.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 259px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>3D visualizations may look stylish but it is commonly agreed that they have a negative effect on accuracy and speed with which graphical data can be interpreted. For ServiceNow it is always the data that counts, while 3D charts may look fun for a minute, 2D charts give you efficient and accurate representation of the data in an easy-to-consume way.</p>
