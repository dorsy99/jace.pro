More than a few hands slowly raised, albeit, reluctantly. Daniele proceeded to console them by saying, "don't feel bad, EY did too just a short time ago."</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #505050;">Daniele then spent the rest of the session sharing how EY used ServiceNow as the underlying technology to transform their global HR service delivery function, and "get the house in order."</span></p><p><img   alt="eycoverslide.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="97579586db9813043eb27a9e0f961904.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #505050;">The driving force behind this need for transformation was EY's corporate plans to grow the business to 300,000 employees by 2020. While HR was providing a positive service experience to their current customers (EY's HR services team refers to employees as their customers), it required a high-touch approach from HR, even for routine employee tasks and enquires. This made it costly, inefficient, and not scalable. </span></p><p></p><p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #505050;">In order to continue providing a great customer service experience to their employees, EY started to shift some of the HR administrative workload from in-country HR teams to their Shared Services Organization. That started to increase overall HR efficiency and enable local in-country HR teams to refocus on higher-value activities.</span></p><p style="background: white;"></p><p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #505050;">Then they began searching for an HR service delivery technology that could support this ambitious transformation. After evaluating 4 different technology vendors, they chose ServiceNow HR Service Management. Daniele descried it as an "easy decision" as EY was already using ServiceNow in other parts of the business and the product delivered on all of their requirements. He specifically called out they are using ServiceNow's dedicated HR application as oppose to repurposing the platform used in IT. This gave them the HR specific functionality they needed, and set them up to benefit from future product enhancements. </span></p><p style="background: white;"></p><p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #505050;">"ServiceNow has been a game-changer for us," said Daniele. He highlighted the following benefits:</span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="color: #505050;">Able to providing an exceptional and consistent customer experience </span></li><li><span style="color: #505050;">Dramatic increase in HR efficiency</span></li><li><span style="color: #505050;">Visibility into how employees are interacting with HR allowing for more informed decisions relating to HR policies and strategies</span></li></ul><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a title="witter.com/servicenow" href="https://twitter.com/servicenow">@servicenow</a> "a <a title="witter.com/hashtag/gamechanger?src=hash" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamechanger?src=hash">#gamechanger</a> for E&amp;Y.   No more "ping pong" back and forth w/ employees." <a title="witter.com/hashtag/singlesystemofHRService?src=hash" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/singlesystemofHRService?src=hash">#singlesystemofHRService</a> <a title="witter.com/hashtag/NowForumLondon?src=hash" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NowForumLondon?src=hash">#NowForumLondon</a></p>— Jeremy J   Bono (@jjbono) <a title="witter.com/jjbono/status/791606916006965248" href="https://twitter.com/jjbono/status/791606916006965248">October 27, 2016</a></blockquote><p></p><p>Daniele also described the ability to do something they never could before. ServiceNow also allows them to manage HR cases end-to-end, even if the process requires work outside HR. "Many HR cases require work outside HR," Daniele described. "We have walls around the HR application to protect sensitive employee data, but can still transfer processes and tasks to non-HR functions like IT, avoiding having to play the ping pong game of bouncing emails back and forth between depts."</p><p></p><p>EY has gone live with ServiceNow in 8 global centers, supporting 147,000 employees with 600 HR shared services staff.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Daniele Columbo's best practices on implementing phase 1 of <a title="witter.com/servicenow" href="https://twitter.com/servicenow">@servicenow</a> HR at <a title="witter.com/EYnews" href="https://twitter.com/EYnews">@EYnews</a> <a title="witter.com/hashtag/TimetoValue?src=hash" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TimetoValue?src=hash">#TimetoValue</a> = 11 weeks! <a title=".co/WAkUHJGbrH" href="https://t.co/WAkUHJGbrH">pic.twitter.com/WAkUHJGbrH</a></p>— Jeremy J   Bono (@jjbono) <a title="witter.com/jjbono/status/791614043962347520" href="https://twitter.com/jjbono/status/791614043962347520">October 27, 2016</a></blockquote><p><img   alt="eydaniele.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="52459406dbd49fc03eb27a9e0f961961.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p>We thank Daniele for sharing his impressive HR transformation journey using ServiceNow.</p><p></p><p>View the slides from his presentation <a title="w.slideshare.net/servicenowdotcom/getting-your-hr-house-in-order" href="http://www.slideshare.net/servicenowdotcom/getting-your-hr-house-in-order">here</a>.</p>
