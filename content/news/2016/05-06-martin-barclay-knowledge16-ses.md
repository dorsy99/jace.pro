<p>Session 17BC13 HackNow on Tuesday May 17th at 1:30PM</p><p>Special thanks to the godfather of ServiceNow hackathons and #HackNow founder <a title="ChrisPope" __default_attr="6290" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="ChrisPope" data-renderedposition="31_532.0200805664062_85_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=a9f016a1db981fc09c9ffb651f961956">ChrisPope</a> for making this session possible.</p><p></p><p>The secrets of hackathons will be revealed. Everything you ever wanted to know about hackathons but were afraid to ask. What are hackathons for? This session promises to be an eye-opener for service domain and   business and process owners! The business and developer benefits of hackathons may not be as well understood as they should be, and this session will address that with first hand evidence from two large ServiceNow customers.</p><p></p><p>I like to think of hackathons as the ServiceNow Platform <strong><em>at volume 11</em></strong>.   The combination of a competitive team environment, the time trial nature that lends a sense of urgency to the proceedings, the latest ServiceNow Platform release, and ServiceNow gurus on-hand to help developers do more faster - all add up to amplified results in the form of innovative apps, integrations, and solutions that can solve business stakeholder problems in an accelerated timeframe.</p><p></p><p>Problems such as application backlogs, legacy apps that need replacing, inefficient processes, or new use cases for the platform that developers simply haven't had the opportunity to address yet all can be solved in just one day with a hackathon. Developers love hackathons because they are a social yet competitive environment and a great way   to demonstrate their expertise to their peers and management and to help each other build winning apps that benefit employees across the company. And there's usually cash and recognition prizes and occasionally pizza and beer to sweeten the deal.</p><p></p><p>We're thrilled to have on stage with us two customers - Shiva Ramachandran, IT Director at American Express; and Bhakti Kundu, Director ServiceNow Center of Excellence at Cognizant Technology Solutions. Shiva and Bhakti will describe why they decided to do a hackathon and what the results were for their business and for the participants. They'll share tips &amp; tricks on what they've learned. We'll also highlight a couple more examples of customer hackathons and a public ServiceNow hackathon   to give you a rounded view of what's possible.</p><p></p><p>We will also have on stage two of the three founding members of the ServiceNow #HackNow team - <a title="David.Gatley" __default_attr="10446" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="David.Gatley" data-renderedposition="431_636.7400512695312_100_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=dc229e25dbd81fc09c9ffb651f9619cf">David.Gatley</a> and <a title="mark.odonnell" __default_attr="2231" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="mark.odonnell" data-renderedposition="431_766.9840698242188_109_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=766ece29dbd41fc09c9ffb651f961932">mark.odonnell</a> - our resident hackathon experts - who will demonstrate the brand new #HackNow app that enables customers to plan their own hackathon,   manage developer registration, team formation,and preparation, and instance and plug-in provisioning.</p><p></p><p>To cap it off you can check out the action at the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=d26e22eddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961964">CreatorCon Hackathon</a> that starts 90 minutes after this session ends in the Developer Hub.
