<p><span>Thank you to the 2,646 developers that responded to the survey that was conducted in January.   We appreciate the time, feedback and the insights you provided us.   This information will play a vital role in continuing to shape the Developer Program around your needs.</span></p><p></p><p>Below is an infographic of the results followed by a more detailed explanation of each section.   Please give us your comments and thoughts below as well.   We are considering running this survey twice a year due to the valuable information the developer community provided us.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img   alt="Infographic.png" class="image-16 jive-image" height="552" src="9d2651cedb981b04ed6af3231f96199a.iix" style="height: 552px;

There are now currently plenty of available instances on the Developers Site.</p></td><td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: middle;"><p><img   alt="Dev Site Features.png" class="image-9 jive-image" height="210" src="51c92c06dbd4d704ed6af3231f9619ba.iix" style="height: 210px;
