<p>My company updated Chrome a couple of weeks ago.     When that update happened, users lost the ability to select the text in form elements if that element was marked as "disabled" in the HTML.     (Fields with readonly="readonly" were still selectable.)     Since essential fields like ticket numbers, that users routinely copy and paste into emails, became unselectable, this "small" annoyance actually caused quite a stir and some (wrongful) backlash against SNOW.</p><p></p><p>I have put a global UI Script in place (Geneva Patch 8 hotfix 1):</p><p></p><pre __default_attr="javascript" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_macro_code jive_text_macro _jivemacro_uid_14788923956591510" data-renderedposition="134_8_1192_128" jivemacro_uid="_14788923956591510" modifiedtitle="true"><p>try{</p><p>   $j( document ).ready(function() {</p><p>         $j('input.form-control').removeAttr('disabled');//edited jQuery selector to reflect need to avoid select-type elements</p><p>} catch(e) {</p><p>   if(g_user.hasRole('admin')){</p><p>       alert(e.message);</p><p>   }</p><p>}</p></pre><p></p><p>We've just started testing it.     I don't see any worrisome performance impacts from a cursory inspection.     I could have improved the specificity of the jQuery selector to also look for the disabled class attribute, but I was concerned about performance.</p><p></p><p>Please let me know if you have any issues with the same.</p><p></p><p>In the spirit of sharing,</p><p></p><p>Trey Carroll</p>
