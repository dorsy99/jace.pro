<p><span style="color: #303030; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Kicking off #IAmACreator </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">We all want our workplace operations to be as efficient as requesting an Uber or ordering on Amazon. We know that when it comes to managing the complexities and interworking of a business, email and manual tools don't cut it. We need to automate work with apps.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">We've seen many Creators take the challenge of consumerizing work tasks through innovative app development on the ServiceNow platform. To profile the faces of these Creators and their 'work hacks,' apps developed to create efficiencies in everyday work, we're kicking off a campaign called #IAmACreator. Over the next few weeks, we'll be uncovering some of our favorite work hacks and spotlighting their Creators through a blog series. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;"><strong>Why We Need Creators</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #303030;">Most companies operate on archaic systems with a dependence on email that keeps employees bogged down with mundane administrative tasks, preventing real work from getting done. In</span> <a title="w.servicenow.com/lpwhp/state-of-work-survey.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/lpwhp/state-of-work-survey.html">our recent </a></span><span style="color: black;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/lpwhp/state-of-work-survey.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/lpwhp/state-of-work-survey.html">survey</a></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">managers said they spend 2 days a week, on average, on administrative tasks that prevent them from doing strategic work.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #303030;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Take ordering a new iPhone from IT, for example. Should it really take dozens of back-and-forth emails with zero visibility into the status of your request? Frustrated by the status quo, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; background: white;">Creators refuse to accept "business as usual" and instead push the business forward, no matter where they sit within a company. They create a more intuitive experience for fellow employees, while also driving workplace productivity. </span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;"><strong>What Are Work Hacks? </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #303030;">A work hack replaces manual or email-based tasks with applications and accelerates the way we work.</span> <a title="ppshowcase.service-now.com/x_snc_app_showcase_index.do#/" href="https://appshowcase.service-now.com/x_snc_app_showcase_index.do#/">Check out our </a></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="ppshowcase.service-now.com/x_snc_app_showcase_index.do#/" href="https://appshowcase.service-now.com/x_snc_app_showcase_index.do#/">application showcase</a></span> <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">to see the range of apps that ServiceNow Creators have already developed. A few examples:</span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="color: #303030;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial;">US Postal Service </span></strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial;">created an app to manage stamp inventory to meet holiday season demand. It was built in 3 weeks and saved USPS more than $1.6M.</span></span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">The <strong>NBA</strong> manages opposing teams, game times, attending vendors, media assets and facilities needs for every game played through a single portal. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">A <strong>State Department of Fish and Wildlife </strong>has an app to track endangered animals.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;"><strong>A Platform for Creators</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">Founder Fred Luddy cited his mission as, "Build a cloud-based platform to enable regular people to create meaningful applications to route work through an enterprise." Our cloud platform was designed to support and foster creativity, productivity and collaboration. It </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: white;"><span style="color: #303030;">empowers employees to rapidly create, deploy and manage cloudâ€‘native business applications by bringing together all required tooling in one familiar,</span> <a title="w.servicenow.com/products/studio.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/studio.html">integrated development environment</a> <span style="color: #000000;">(IDE).</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"><br/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #303030; font-family: Arial; background: white;"><strong>A Snapshot of a Creator</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">There is no one type of Creator. They come from a variety of levels, titles, backgrounds and skillsets. They are united in the desire to improve their workplace for   themselves and those around them. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #303030;">As the lines continue to blur between IT and business users, application development can be carried out by almost anyone within the organization. In fact,</span> <a title="w.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3119717" href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3119717">Gartner predicts</a> <span style="color: #303030;">that by 2020, 60% of all fast-mode application development projects will be done outside of formal IT teams, driven by the rise of aspirational developers. This means employees across different departments will be able to harness the knowledge within the workplace in an automated and systematic manner, driving widespread transformation.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #303030;">One Creator who succeeded in just that is Bror Andrigna, senior manager of Enterprise Tech/Support Services at Latham &amp; Watkins LLP. With more than 600 secretaries worldwide, the law firm needed a way to offer streamlined and consolidated support for its first-year associates. Sheila Stanton, senior manager of Policies and Procedures, came to Bror with a request to create a single portal.</span> <a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=NuNuXDSlHDU&feature=youtu.be&list=PLtPPHGXv_Jpk8AESXNZsTFa1IB4Z_0hoV" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuNuXDSlHDU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLtPPHGXv_Jpk8AESXNZsTFa1IB4Z_0hoV">Watch this </a></span><span style="color: black;"><a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=NuNuXDSlHDU&feature=youtu.be&list=PLtPPHGXv_Jpk8AESXNZsTFa1IB4Z_0hoV" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuNuXDSlHDU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLtPPHGXv_Jpk8AESXNZsTFa1IB4Z_0hoV">video</a></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;"> to learn how together they created a Secretarial Services Application and improved employee experience across the organization.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img   alt="SVN-CloudCampaign-031616-1200x628-v2.2.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="ea90800adb58d3049c9ffb651f961989.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 324px;"/></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;"><strong>How To Get Started Creating</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #303030;">Below are some resources to help you get started:   </span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="color: #303030;">Take the ServiceNow platform for</span> <a title="w.servicenow.com/lpdem/demonow-cloud-platform-app-dev.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/lpdem/demonow-cloud-platform-app-dev.html">a free </a></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/lpdem/demonow-cloud-platform-app-dev.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/lpdem/demonow-cloud-platform-app-dev.html">test drive</a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="color: #000000;">Get inspired by checking out our</span> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="tore.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/home" href="https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/home">library of existing applications</a>.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Visit our </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/solutions/develop-new-cloud-business-apps.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/solutions/develop-new-cloud-business-apps.html">solutions page</a> to learn why developing new cloud business applications is important. </span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Get to know ServiceNow developers in this </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=b87dae29dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619ed">infographic</a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Join the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="eveloper.servicenow.com/app.do#!/program/developer" href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/program/developer">ServiceNow Developer Program.</a> </span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Participate in our active </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=1e295a2ddbd897c068c1fb651f96199f">Developer Community</a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><strong>What's Next? </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Over the next few weeks leading up to <a title="witter.com/hashtag/creatorcon" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/creatorcon">#CreatorCon</a> at Knowledge16 (<a title="witter.com/hashtag/know16" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/know16">#Know16</a>), we'll be highlighting Creators and sharing their motivations, challenges and successes in changing the way work is done.
