<p>A few days ago I got a question from a colleague who was wondering if it is possible to make something similar as the OOB VIP-flag. An image that shows on users under certain circumstances. The VIP-flag looks like this for those who hasn't seen it.</p><p></p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" height="43" src="c9f5bc46db989344e9737a9e0f9619c8.iix" style="height: 43px; width: 1110.83px;" width="1111"/></p><p></p><p>So I went to System UI -&gt; field styles to see where that little picture came from.</p><p>And in there you will find the record for this, connected to the incident table:</p><p></p><p><img   class="image-2 jive-image" height="169" src="b031d88edb901f048c8ef4621f96191b.iix" style="height: 169px; width: 1027.25px;" width="1027"/></p><p></p><p>Taking a closer look at the style you can see this:</p><p></p><p><img   class="image-3 jive-image" src="5a1fa3fddb1c1fc03eb27a9e0f961906.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p></p><p>Ahh, so the file is in the image library... Lets go and see what else there is. Perhaps I can use another OOB image for my colleague.</p><p>So I headed to System UI -&gt; Images</p><p></p><p><img   class="jive-image image-4" height="56" src="fb9b9dcedb1c1b04ed6af3231f9619b0.iix" style="height: 56px; width: 1021.18px;" width="1021"/></p><p>Hmmm.. only 163 images? is this really the place?</p><p></p><p>Lets see if we find vip.gif...</p><p></p><p><img  class="image-5 jive-image" src="888af046dbdcdfc03eb27a9e0f96194d.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p>NO RECORDS TO DISPLAY?!</p><p></p><p>This really confused me... </p><p>Why can't I find the image and how many other images are in the dark, waiting to be discovered?</p><p></p><p>It took me quite a while, looking, digging, searching &amp; bribing. But I finally found out where to see them all, and it only took one page to rule them all.</p><p></p><p>image_picker.do...</p><p><img  class="image-6 jive-image" src="5c3bfb31db101344e9737a9e0f9619c6.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p>There you have it... and if you for example choose "icons" in the dropdown you get this:</p><p></p><p><img  class="image-7 jive-image" height="314" src="ea6d51cedb14d7041dcaf3231f96192a.iix" style="height: 314px; width: 700.288px;" width="700"/></p><p>And if you hover over the icon, you get a nice infotext about where url for that specific image.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope this will save some hours for someone else out there =)</p>
