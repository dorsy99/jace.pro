As our portfolio is rapidly expanding into areas like Security Operations Management, Customer Service Management, Field Service Management and IT Business Management, we wanted to show you what's new, what's coming and how you can benefit. </span></p><p></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">ExecConnect</span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Third, we offer an exclusive executive track in all cities, called ExecConnect.

Over the last weeks, we have been constantly updating our agendas with new presenters and the stories they'll share from main stage, in breakout rooms and at various networking opportunities throughout the day. Talking to our customers is the fastest, most effective way of understanding where you should go next.</span></p><p></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The latest in Service Management technology</span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Whether you want to get started with modernizing your IT service desk or you are ready to bring Service Management to service functions beyond IT — NowForum will have content tracks for all levels of platform adoption.

So bring your questions, colleagues and plans to the table and get the most out of your conference.   </span></p><p></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Ground breaking keynotes</span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">ServiceNow has come a long way since Fred Luddy founded the company in 2004. Today, we're broadly recognized as the main innovator in IT service management. Or, as someone commented to a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-first-take-four-takeaways-from-gartner-magic-quadrant-jarod-greene?trk=prof-post"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">recent blog post</span></a><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> by Jarod Greene of Cherwell: "I don't see a lot of innovation in ITSM aside from what ServiceNow is doing around broadening a single unified platform." </span></p><p></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Beyond ITSM, we lead the adoption of IT-inspired service management by other service departments, like HR, Finance, Facility Management and Legal. IT has led the way in consolidating, automating and consumerising service management across the global enterprise. It just makes sense to apply that thinking to other service functions, as Greene agrees in his post. ServiceNow customers confirm everyday that other departments will follow IT's best practice. ServiceNow and partners are committed to help them succeed.</span></p><p></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Our NowForum keynotes will expose you to the thought leaders working on our service automation platform, illustrated by plenty of local customer examples and demonstrations of technology concepts on the horizon.</span></p><p></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Our business partners</span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We're very excited to have Accenture as our Diamond Sponsor for all NowForums across the globe. As ServiceNow grows, so our ecosystem of local reselling partners, Managed Service Providers, Global System Integrators and Technology Partners. Without exception, they're part of NowForum and you can spend some good time getting to know their teams, solutions and services at the event. </span></p><p></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So to conclude, NowForum is almost here and now is the time to sign up. Join the Service Revolution!</span></p><p></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #0070c0;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/nowforum.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/nowforum.html">&gt;&gt;&gt;REGISTER&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></span></p>
