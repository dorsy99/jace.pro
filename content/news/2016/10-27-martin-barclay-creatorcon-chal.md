<p>I'm pleased to announce that two new significant prizes have been confirmed for the three CreatorCon Challenge winners:</p><p></p><p><strong>1) ServiceNow Sales Awareness:</strong> ServiceNow will produce a video (3-5 minutes) with the three winners where you can pitch and show off your app to the global ServiceNow sales team. ServiceNow sales is incentivized to help Technology Partners (that would be your company if you win) sell <a title="tore.servicenow.com/" href="https://store.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow Store</a> apps as they receive 20% of the app license ACV in quota/commission credit when one of their customers purchases an app on the Store. The video will be distributed through the ServiceNow Sales Newsletter and posted to our Sales Enablement Info Center.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="sales_tools_alert_email_header.PNG" class="image-2 jive-image" src="846d8182db1897049c9ffb651f961907.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 88px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p><strong>2) Customer Awareness &amp; Leads: </strong>ServiceNow will promote and host a customer webinar (60 minutes) where you can show off your app to our global customer base and drive leads to your app listing page on the ServiceNow Store.
