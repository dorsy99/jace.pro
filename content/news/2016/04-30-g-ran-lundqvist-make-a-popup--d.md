<p>I was helping a user on the forum who had requirements that was something like this:</p><p></p><ul><li>Wanted one button (UI Action) which would make a popup window appear.</li><li>The window should give the user a couple of choices and depending on the choice, field(s) should be set on the form and then the form should save.</li></ul><p></p><p>The difficult part here in my eyes was how was I going to get the values from the UI Page back to the form after the user have made their choice and pressed OK.</p><p></p><p>I was looking through the forum and what I could find was that you could save the choice in a temporary table which then the ui action(server part)</p><p>could fetch and put in the form. Since I don't wanna have a table only for this, that solution wasn't an option.</p><p></p><p>Next thing that came across my mind was to perhaps use the GlideSession API and clientData methods. but I ain't really so happy about using</p><p>the clientData for some value holders and have come across some weird problems when the session data isn't emptied correctly. So this turned out to not be an option either.</p><p></p><p>But after some testing I discovered that the solution was much more simpler than the above.</p><p></p><p>I just put the "g_form.setValue" after I have destroyed the popup window in the client script part of the UI Page.</p><p></p><p>To give a simple example:</p><p></p><p>Here is the UI Action that is only creating the popup window:</p><p><img   alt="ui page radio button 2.GIF" class="image-1 jive-image" src="3e2cdc4edb585304b322f4621f961982.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 463px;"/></p><p></p><p>And here is the UI Page "whyHold" that the UI Action calls for.</p><p></p><p>I just put a few radio buttons and a Cancel/OK. in the "I have no imagination" I just take the value, put it in short description and saves the form.</p><p>If they don't choose any option, then OK button won't work.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="ui page radio button.GIF" class="image-2 jive-image" src="566b3335dbd45704ed6af3231f96199e.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 458px;"/></p><p></p><p>I hope this will give you some ideas of what you can do.</p><p></p><p>//Göran</p>
