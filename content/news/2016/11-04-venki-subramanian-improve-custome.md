<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Demand for cloud computing software and applications has been on a steady rise in recent years because of the many benefits it offers to businesses of all sizes and types. Cloud vendors usually offer a broad collection of services such as infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service. These services and solutions are easy to implement and adopt. This model also makes it easy for customers to walk away if they are not satisfied with the product or support   experience. The importance of flawless customer support is paramount for any cloud vendor to reduce customer churn.</span><br/><span style="font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When a customer reports an issue, it is very common for support agents to engage with other parts of organizations — cloud operations, engineering, sales and the like, to identify the root cause of the issue and to resolve it. Furthermore, customers now have increased expectations from cloud companies to proactively detect and resolve issues since cloud companies are ultimately responsible for operating and managing underlying infrastructure, software and services.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="blog_1.png" height="398" src="3cf25c8adb549fc03eb27a9e0f9619d8.iix" style="width: 846px; height: 397.663px;" width="846"/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In spite of the evident need to have all departments connected and working together to resolve issues, most customer service and back-end cloud operations teams are not seamlessly integrated. Customer support agents are forced to use multiple, disconnected tools and unstructured ways to contact operations, engineering or other teams. This results in an inconsistent service experience that negatively impacts customer satisfaction.</span></p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">ServiceNow Customer Service Management - a single platform for customer engagement, service and operations </span> </strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Service management connects someone requesting a service to the service   provider, and enables efficient delivery of the service utilizing structured tasks and workflows.
