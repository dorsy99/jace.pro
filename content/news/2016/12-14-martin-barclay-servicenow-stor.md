Dominic Phillips, VP of Corporate Development, will close the speaking sessions by explaining the investment opportunities for early to growth stage enterprise ISVs with ServiceNow Ventures, including the CreatorCon Challenge.</p><p></p><p>Then all in-person attendees will enjoy house-smoked BBQ from The Galley for lunch and meetings.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="store_summit_agenda.PNG" class="image-1 jive-image" height="511" src="656c8902db189f048c8ef4621f9619d8.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 511px; width: 908.784px;" width="908"/></p><p></p><p>We're expecting well over 120 people from over 60 Technology Partners to attend either in person at ServiceNow Headquarters in Santa Clara, or on the corporate virtual live stream system wherever in the world they may be.   Suffice to say we feel like we've taken the "mini" out of "mini Summit".
