<p><span style="color: #505050;">Dave works for Awesome, Inc. and has been their ServiceNow administrator since 2009. This year, he inherited a fortune and decided to retire and move to Italy. The company worked hard to backfill the position, but wasn't able to before Dave left. Now Kate has been hired, and she has no idea what any of the passwords are for her instances!</span></p><p><span style="color: #eb7a3d;"><span style="color: #303030;"> </span><br/></span></p><center><img height="245" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlCqV35hdEg2GUo/giphy.gif" style="height: 245px; width: 326.667px;" width="326"/></center><p></p><p>What is Kate to do? What would you do? If any of these scenarios below happened to your team, would you know how to handle it?</p><ul><li>The administrator of all instances left and nobody knows the admin password now, in fact- you're not sure if there's even an admin account!</li><li>You performed a <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=15cc2265dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96195d">zBoot</a> on your instance, and the admin password doesn't work anymore.</li><li>You got a brand-new instance for testing (or dev work) but didn't get the login credentials.</li></ul><p></p><p>Up until now, resolution of these scenarios required you to either call support, or head over to the HI Service Portal to log an incident. You would need to wait for support to contact you so they could HOP into the instance(s) and reset the password for you. Not very convenient. That is changing.</p><p></p><h2>Resetting your instance administrator's password</h2><p>We now have a self-service option for you to reset the admin password on any sub-production instance through the HI Service Portal! You'll be able to log in to the HI Service Portal and set a temporary password for any of your sub-production instances. Shortly (usually within 5 minutes), you can log in and reset the admin password, all without having to contact support.</p><p></p><p>All you need to do is type "reset admin password" in the search bar after logging in to HI, and click the link for the catalog item. Set your temporary password and you're done!</p><p><img   alt="reset instance admin password.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="25a3d802db1817041dcaf3231f961936.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 326px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>If you have more than one administrator identified in HI, all of them will get an email letting them know that the password was changed. In this email, it will also let the other admins know who changed it so you can make sure you're all on the same page. We are very excited to bring another self-service option to the HI Service Portal as part of the many ways we are working to make your job easier!</p>
