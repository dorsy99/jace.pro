<p>This is my introduction blog which I will keep short (and above the fold). Back in 2005 I started my career. My first job was as a systems administrator and working on the help desk. It was often a challenge to s<span style="line-height: 1.5;">olve an incident or problem without the necessary information. This is where I learned to ask the following quite often: how, what, who, when, why and where. Let's refer to those as the HW's.</span></p><p><img   alt="blog lubert.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="ea63040edbd8d3041dcaf3231f961977.iix" style="line-height: 1.5; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Wiki has a nice summary of my study where I was "<em>primarily concerned with the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, movement, dissemination, and protection of information</em>." I always think about how I can communicate in a structured way based on the information properties or what it contains. <br/>Let's try and see if I can explain anything via a structured way of the HW's. As ITSM customer experience manager and I will use this "HW structure" for my upcoming blogs.</p><p>But first, let me ask you the "how" and I will provide the W's.</p><p></p><p>Who: 4 people with different experiences to cross the rope bridge and 1 is capable to do it in 5 mins, the second in 10, the other two in 20 and 25 mins respectively. Whenever they are on the bridge together, the slowest person will set the pace for both of them. (E.g. 5 and 10 cross together in total of 10 mins).</p><p>Why: The end goal is that they need to cross the bridge in order to be safe within exactly 60 mins.</p><p>What: Â  Getting across the river with only 1 light.</p><p>Where: A rope bridge over the river which can only hold 2 people at the same time.</p><p>When: During night time.</p><p></p><p>So how will all four of them to be able to cross the river with only one light and a maximum of two people on the rope bridge at the same time?</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #e23d39;">*spoiler alert below</span></p>
