<p>Many of us go to the doctor on a regular basis for health check ups to help us determine where we are with our health, and decide if we need to take any action to ensure we remain healthy. The same is true in the world of IT. Organizations need to be able to determine where things stand, how well they're working and take any action if needed. One of the new features in Helsinki is the CMDB Health Dashboard - helping organizations stay on top of the health their CMDB to ensure that their single source of truth is up-to-date and in good shape.
