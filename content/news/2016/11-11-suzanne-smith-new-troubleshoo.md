<p>We have a great set of new articles in the HI Knowledge Base to help you with <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0597571" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0597571">troubleshooting MID Server issues</a>!

The articles ask you a series of questions and walk you down a path based on your answers.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="MID_server_troubleshootarticle.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="a5d5954edb5813043eb27a9e0f9619ad.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>MID Server upgrading issues</h2><p>The first path is related to upgrading. Has your instance recently been upgraded manually or through the <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549676" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549676">Quarterly Patching Program</a>? Are you experiencing any of the following issues?</p><ul><li>MID Server status is <strong>Down</strong> in the MID Server list</li><li>Discovery scans get stuck</li><li>MID Server does not keep running</li><li>MID Server status is <strong>Up</strong> but is not responding</li></ul><p>If any of these symptoms are occurring, work your way through the questions and answers to reach a possible solution. For example:</p><ul><li>Is the MID Server up? If the answer is no, open the agent log.</li><li>Can you read the agent log? If the answer is yes, search for specific phrases.</li></ul><p></p><h2>MID Server user credential issues</h2><p>The second path is related to user credentials. A MID Server must have a valid user with which to authenticate. If the MID Server cannot authenticate successfully, it cannot perform correctly. You might have credential issues if you experiencing any of these issues:</p><ul><li>All MID Servers are down</li><li>CIs are duplicated during Discovery</li><li>MID Server keeps going down</li><li>MID agent log is reporting 404, could not authenticate</li><li>MID Server upgrade is hung</li><li>Cannot restart MID Server</li></ul><p>If these symptoms are occuring, go through the questions and follow the path based on your answers. For example:</p><ul><li>Does the MID Server user password contain special characters? If no, keep troubleshooting - special characters in the password do prevent authentication.</li><li>Is the MID Server user locked out? If you don't know, follow the steps provided to determine if the user is locked out.</li></ul><p></p><h2>Additional information</h2><ul><li><a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0597571" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0597571">Troubleshooting Guide: MID Server</a> (Landing page for the new set of troubleshooting articles on HI written by Frankie and Chris)</li><li><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-operations-management/page/product/mid-server/reference/r-MIDServer.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-operations-management/page/product/mid-server/reference/r-MIDServer.html">MID Server</a> (product documentation landing page for MID Server information)</li><li><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-operations-management/page/product/mid-server/reference/r_RequiredConfigurationForMIDServer.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-operations-management/page/product/mid-server/reference/r_RequiredConfigurationForMIDServer.html">Required configuration for MID Server </a>(product documentation about setting up MID Server user credentials)</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxzIrhlgk" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxzIrhlgk">Troubleshooting ServiceNow MID Server Issues</a> (video on the ServiceNow YouTube channel)</li><li><a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549676" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549676">Quarterly Patching Program Customer FAQ</a> (common questions about the QPP with detailed answers)</li></ul>
