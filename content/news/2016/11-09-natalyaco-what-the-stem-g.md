<p><em>At ServiceNow, we are inspired by every person who turns new ideas into reality. To celebrate #<a title="witter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23NationalSTEMDay&src=typd" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23NationalSTEMDay&amp;src=typd">NationalSTEMDay</a>, we are spotlighting organizations that are actively working to close the STEM gap and provide the next generation of scientists, engineers, and programmers with the tools they need to thrive.</em></p><p></p><p>Some of the world's greatest ideas have been sparked right here in the United States. From the Wright brothers' first flight to Katherine Johnson's equations that sent astronauts to outer space, the advances our country has made in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics is staggering. But what would you say if we told you that <strong><a title="ww.adeccousa.com/employers/resources/infographic-stem-skills-are-driving-innovation/" href="https://www.adeccousa.com/employers/resources/infographic-stem-skills-are-driving-innovation/">2.4 million</a></strong> STEM jobs could go unfilled by 2018? It would mean millions of minds would be missing from the drive to create life-changing breakthroughs in medicine and technology, potentially leaving a massive rift in our country's resume of innovation.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="gameover_looping.gif" class="image-1 jive-image" height="322" src="a011098edb5013043eb27a9e0f96198a.iix" style="width: 572px; height: 321.981px;" width="572"/></p><p></p><p>How, then, do we address this growing STEM gap? The good news is that we have an entire generation of creative, resourceful, and diverse young people who can help bridge the chasm. Technology has spread its roots in almost every young person's life, which presents a huge opportunity to pursue future careers in STEM â€” if they can become energized to do so. It is every member of society's responsibility to encourage the next generation's passion for STEM. <a title="w.sparkprogramming.org/" href="http://www.sparkprogramming.org/">One organization addressing the gap head-on is SPARK Programming</a>, inspiring the next generation of programmers through coding.</p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/AzhhCqqnZzE" width="539" height="404"/></p><p></p><p>And children aren't the only ones who can change the gloomy STEM forecast. Programs like <a title="w.npower.org/Our-Programs/Tech-Career-Accelerator.aspx" href="http://www.npower.org/Our-Programs/Tech-Career-Accelerator.aspx">NPower</a> and <a title="w.genesysworks.org/about-us/locations/bay-area/about-us/mission-vision/" href="http://www.genesysworks.org/about-us/locations/bay-area/about-us/mission-vision/">Genesys</a> are investing in our returning veterans and under-privileged highschool graduates, who have strong potential to thrive in engineering, science, and tech careers. Once we all commit to efforts like these, the world's next great ideas will be met with the skills needed to bring them to life.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>To learn more about how </em><a _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=62fc66a5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961933"><em>ServiceNow is partnering with these organizations</em></a><em>, or how you can make a difference in the future of STEM, visit: </em><a href="http://changetheequation.org/resources"><em>http://changetheequation.org/resources</em></a><em> .
