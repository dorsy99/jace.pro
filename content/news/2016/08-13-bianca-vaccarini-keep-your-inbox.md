<p>Death to email! Just kidding. I understand email is still an important part of our day-to-day office work. Some teams just prefer email while the rest of us might prefer to use Connect. If you are like me, a clean Outlook inbox is the goal. I have filters set up for specific folders where I prioritize what needs to be addressed and when. But there are some notifications I get in my inbox that create more clutter than provide actionable information.</p><p></p><p>For example, I don't need to get email notifications for every <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0596327" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0596327">response to calendar invitations</a> for change requests. The Change Request application can send pending changes to a user's Microsoft Outlook Calendar automatically by <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/reference_pages/reference/r_BaselineEmailNotifications.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/reference_pages/reference/r_BaselineEmailNotifications.html">email in the base system</a>. This notifies recipients of the change request schedule and exports the schedule to Microsoft Outlook formatted with iCal. There are certain business needs that require an individual to see and view all of those responses, but others may want to turn them off.</p><p><img   alt="CHG NOTIF TRUE.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="3fd49042db589704ed6af3231f961958.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 214px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Depending on business requirements, users may not want the calendar invitations for change requests to have the ability to send a response to ServiceNow meeting invitations.</p><p></p><h2>Turn off response notifications from Change calendar invites for requests:</h2><ol><ol><li>Navigate to the Email Templates under Policy.</li><li>Open the change.calendar.integration email template.</li><li>Change the value for RSVP to FALSE.</li></ol></ol><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Change:</strong></td><td><strong>To:</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ATTENDEE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;RSVP=<strong>TRUE</strong>:MAILTO:${to}</td><td>ATTENDEE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;RSVP=<strong>FALSE</strong>:MAILTO:${to}</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="CHNG NOTIF FALSE.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="19983bf9db101304b322f4621f961912.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 216px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><em>Notice that the arrow to send a response is removed.</em></p><p></p><p>When the property is TRUE, the received calendar invitation will show an arrow mark on the Accept, Decline, and Tentative buttons. Once clicked, it will give your attendees several options to reply to the sender. When RSVP is set to FALSE, there is no option to respond. Users just need to click to accept or decline the change. That means users who receive the Change calendar request invitation in Outlook will no longer <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0596327" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0596327">see the ability to send a response</a> and you can save yourself the grief of having to "Mark as read" or create yet another separate filter.</p>
