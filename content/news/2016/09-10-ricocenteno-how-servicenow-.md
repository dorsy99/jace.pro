With this, it initiates an event in various forms and there are hundreds of monitoring tools out there that generate events.</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>- Informational Events</li><li>- Exception/threshold Events</li><li>- Incidents</li></ul><p></p><p>So who looks at all of these events?   Who deciphers what they mean and acts on them?   Roles include but not limited to:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>- Service Desk/Help Desk</li><li>- IT Operators (Network/Infrastructure)</li><li>- Application Owners/Management</li><li>- Security (SOM)</li></ul><p></p><p>With all the events, in any environment, we can have thousands if not millions of events in a day. IT professionals are troubled by.</p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>- the number of interfaces they need to page through to understand what the event means and where the issue truly lies.</li><li>- they need to ensure that the correct events are be generated by the right monitoring tool.</li><li>- How do they handle too many events?</li><li>- How do they identify/handle common manual tasks?</li></ul><p></p><p><strong style="font-size: 14.0pt;">2 — Structuring our events</strong></p><p></p><p>The challenges above really depict real world issues that IT face on a day to day basis.   So let's take a look at our challenges again and put context around how Servicenow can assist to structuring how events get handled to eliminate duplicate events, create dependency correlation, understand root cause analysis and automate remediation processes.</p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>- the number of interfaces they need to page through to understand what the event means and where the issue truly lies (correlation/consolidation).<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><strong>Which events are serious enough so that an Alert and incident need to be created?</strong></li><li><strong>Are we monitoring the right CI's?</strong></li><li><strong>Are we establishing baselines and reconfiguring thresholds?</strong></li></ul></li><li>- they need to ensure that the correct events are be generated by the right monitoring tool.

Customer maturities are all over the board constrained by management, cost, resources and knowledge. Servicenow Event Management assists in defining solutions to common challenges and constraints for quick adoption. </p>
