<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order to help you better manage quarterly patching and upgrades, we've provided the ability to modify the target version of an existing upgrade change request. This new feature applies to quarterly patching change requests as well as change requests you schedule using the HI Service Portal's <strong>Manage Upgrades</strong> page. The ability to modify the target version of an existing change eliminates the need to cancel and reschedule upgrade change requests in order to go to a different version than the one that was originally scheduled.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">From now on, when an upgrade change request is created, a new <strong>Target Version</strong> field is populated with the version the instance will be patched or upgraded to. The <strong>Target Version</strong> field can be modified if the following conditions are true:</span></p><p></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The planned start date of the change is in the future (note that it cannot be the current day's date, regarless of the time)</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The instance being patched or upgraded is not an Express instance</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The version does not require an entitlement to be granted</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The version is not a downgrade</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For Quarterly Patching specifically, the target version is not below the current patch target version</span></li></ul><p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"></p><p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img   alt="Target Version.PNG" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7a9ab7f9db945704ed6af3231f96191b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 425px; float: none;"/></span></p>
