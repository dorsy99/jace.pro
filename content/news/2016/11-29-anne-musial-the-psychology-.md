<p>Richard Branson once said, "Success in business is all about people, people, people. Whatever industry a company is in, its employees are its biggest competitive advantage." Retaining top talent is critical to an organization's success, and now more than ever, employers are placing an emphasis on their most valuable asset: their people.</p><p></p><p>According to a recent Gallup poll, "Millennials also show less willingness to stay in their current jobs.
