<p>A while back I was working on a project where I ended up having to write some GlideRecord queries based on quite a few different tables and parameters. I was using <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/script/general_scripting/reference/r_SyntaxEditorMacros.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/script/general_scripting/reference/r_SyntaxEditorMacros.html">syntax editor macros</a> along with the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/script/general_scripting/reference/r_EdtJvaScptWSyntxEdtr.html#r_EdtJvaScptWSyntxEdtr" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/script/general_scripting/reference/r_EdtJvaScptWSyntxEdtr.html#r_EdtJvaScptWSyntxEdtr">find and replace</a> feature in the syntax editor, but it seemed to me like it should be easier than.</p><p></p><p>I started thinking about what I really wanted, and what I decided was that I wanted a way to generate a GlideRecord query from a list that contained the table name, the encoded query string, the sort field, and allow me to set the variable name of the GlideRecord object. Once I had those goals, the execution was actually pretty straightforward, so I built it out and uploaded it to share.</p><p><a title="hare.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/516fcec8131f5600e77a36666144b02d/overview" href="https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/516fcec8131f5600e77a36666144b02d/overview">Get GlideRecord Query from List</a></p><p></p><p>Here's a screenshot demo of how it works after you've uploaded the update set into your instance.</p><p></p><p>First you can go to any list and add some queries to the filter:</p><p><img alt="f7ec25aab5.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="http://puu.sh/oMND4/f7ec25aab5.png" style="width: 620px; height: 329px;"/></p><p></p><p>Then run the query and click the Get Query list banner ui action and you'll get a prompt to name you GlideRecord object variable.</p><p><img alt="6275146d65.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="http://puu.sh/oMNMF/6275146d65.png" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Name it (something other than gr) and hit ok, and you'll get another popup with your generated GlideRecord code.</p><p><img alt="6df0851be5.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="http://puu.sh/oMNNN/6df0851be5.png" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Now hit CTRL+C and paste that into your script editor of choice:</p><p><img alt="db469d27c5.png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="http://puu.sh/oNbCo/db469d27c5.png" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>That's it! Just a simple way to easily generate a GlideRecord query from a list of records to use wherever you'd like.</p>
