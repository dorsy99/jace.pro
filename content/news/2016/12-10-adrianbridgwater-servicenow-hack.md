<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Enterprise cloud company ServiceNow hosted its last #HackNow developer <a title="ackathon.service-now.com/hacknow?id=overview" href="https://hackathon.service-now.com/hacknow?id=overview">hackathon</a> of 2016 on a pleasingly mild December day, at the firm's UK office in London's St Paul's Cathedral area.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Coding directly inside the ServiceNow Studio <a title="w.servicenow.com/products/studio.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/studio.html">Integrated Development Environment</a> (IDE), #HackNow attendees were able to create applications using Studio's browser-based toolset to create any type of application file. Studio IDE integrated with Git and the ServiceNow 'scoped app' repository gives developers a powerful means of implementing a modern Agile development process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img   alt="CxZnVdHWIAANHHK.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="722863b1db181fc03eb27a9e0f96197c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 465px;"/></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Breath of power, scope of functionality</strong></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">"The breadth of the ServiceNow platform allows developers to create anything from forms to portals, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), business rules and logic and onward to database tables and so on," said <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=a9f016a1db981fc09c9ffb651f961956">Chris Pope, Office of the CSO at ServiceNow</a>.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">"Given the scope that our HackNow developers have to produce functionality layers that can work to solve real business problems, it is always fascinating to see what the teams in attendance produce at these events. Our London crowd showed superb levels of enthusiasm and a willingness to innovate, learn and enjoy themselves."</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">HackNow London 2016 attendees were tasked with solving a business problem (rather than an information technology issue) and were able to use the forthcoming 'Istanbul' release of ServiceNow, to develop solutions that could effectively replace Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software products.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Actual applications on the day were created and crafted using programming languages, platforms and frameworks including AngularJS, Bootstrap, NodeJS and JavaScript.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><img   alt="SW5_0058-2.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="436fe44adb9c57041dcaf3231f961924.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 414px;"/></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Team #1: <a title="w.devoteam.co.uk/" href="http://www.devoteam.co.uk/">DevoTeam</a></strong></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This team spent their time at ServiceNow HackNow London 2016 building a Christmas 'gifting portal' designed specifically with children as the primary user base. Children can use the <strong><em>Santa's Workshop</em></strong> application to request presents (directly from Santa himself, obviously) and then provide feedback to both parents and manufacturers on the quality, usability and performance of the gift itself. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Kids can also use the app to log complaints about products (using <a title="w.servicenow.com/products/performance-analytics.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/performance-analytics.html">ServiceNow performance analytics</a>) so that firms targeting the gift market can hopefully refine and augment their final market offerings. The application also featured a <a title="w.servicenow.com/solutions/replace-my-helpdesk.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/solutions/replace-my-helpdesk.html">Customer Service Helpdesk</a></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> function for broken and faulty toys and an </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/products/it-service-automation-applications/asset-management.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/it-service-automation-applications/asset-management.html">Asset Management</a> element to tie into manufacturer's stock and inventory databases. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Team #2: SNOW Troopers</strong></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This team created a vacation request system. Radically more direct than integrating this type of functionality into a wider or higher-level <a title="w.servicenow.com/products/shared-services-applications/hr-service-management.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/shared-services-applications/hr-service-management.html">Human Resources</a> (HR) platform, the <strong><em>MyVacation</em></strong> app allows employees to request time off and schedule leave or breaks with their appropriate line managers. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This app represented a superb example of a custom-build application that resides on the ServiceNow platform itself and was delivered with outstanding User eXperience functionality. The app itself is presented at a considerably lower cost of maintenance compared to COTS software.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Team #3: <a title="w.tesm.com/" href="http://www.tesm.com/">TESMania</a></strong></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This team created an application to provide a socially connected way of bringing together like-minded groups in the workplace. Designed specifically to be used inside organisations to champion, encourage and organise extracurricular activities, individuals are able to </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">register an activity idea, create an interest group… or develop and manage a complete event. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Users can RSVP to each event and join in a connected conversation as a micro-community develops for each pursuit. The application also has wider activity tracking functionality via a Google Fit application to set goals and compete with colleagues.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Team #4: SNDeveloper</strong></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This team created an application called <strong><em>LiveDoc</em></strong> which provided 'embedded living scoped documentation' for applications. In terms of use, <strong><em>LiveDoc </em></strong>means that software application documentation would ship 'along with' the application itself. More specifically, this means that each application's documentation information would be tied to the version, instance and edition of the application itself in a self-contained format. This way, the documentation is guaranteed to be relevant to the features and capabilities (or restrictions) of the application in hand. The team built <strong><em>LiveDoc </em></strong>using ServiceNow forms, views and widgets.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>… and the winner was</strong></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img   alt="SW5_0197-2.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="452c004adb9017041dcaf3231f9619fa.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 414px;"/></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The winning team of the 2016 ServiceNow HackNow London event was TESMania with <strong><em>PlayNow.</em></strong> The team received goody bags and (obviously) extensive bragging rights and recognition across their own firms and the ServiceNow coding community. There's already a plan forming to introduce this into their organisation. We will be sure to follow up and report back as to the success of the internal roll out in the future. </span></p>
