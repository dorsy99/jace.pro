<p>Our platform makes difficult tasks easy. This simplification ServiceNow provides their customers effects how the customer developer thinks. They forget that programming is really not an easy task, and begin scripting without restraint. Developers must be strict on themselves: always testing, always checking, especially working in any platform that they did not create. Developers must ensure their customization coincides with the ServiceNow platform as one.</p><p></p><p>How an engineer customizes a ServiceNow instance relates to how many issues their company will have during business hours. Good customizations do not disrupt, bad customizations cause nightmares.</p><p></p><p>If you are going to customize ServiceNow <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do it right! </span>Many customization issues are a simple fix on the engineer's side: check the variables.</p><p></p><h1>Checking your variables while developing<span style="color: #eb7a3d;"><br/></span></h1><p>If you're not sure why your program is broken, then you may want to start with checking your variables.   Overall, variable checks establish a safe place for you to start your customization safely.</p><p></p><p>Checking your data will ensure that you are more than 50% done.</p><p></p><p>Checking your code allows you to:</p><ul><li>See concrete data</li><li>Alert yourself when something is wrong</li><li>Ensure that it is not your mistake</li><li>Move on the the real issues in your system that deserve time, like the logical aspects of it.</li></ul><p></p><p>Before assuming things just work, you owe it to yourself, to ensure you are working with good data.   For example, a manager opens an incident, frustrated with ServiceNow because their their engineer claims the one week issue they are experiencing is a ServiceNow error.   The business suffers and loses valuable work time, the manager says this is something ServiceNow must fix.   A ServiceNow support engineer reviews the incident and in a few hours can find the issue. In this case, it is clearly a modification on the client side.</p><p></p><p>The customization error, "variable is undefined," means the engineer's variables were non-existent or not defined well and caused the system to stop rendering correctly. An error like this can delay a roll out of a product for one month. This could have been resolved early on if the developer took a moment to review their variables.</p><p></p><h2>How To Check Variables Basics in Javascript</h2><h4>The basic variable culprits that could be messing with your customization:</h4><ul><li>Undefined</li><li>Null</li><li>"" (empty string)</li></ul><p></p><p>You need to check for these elements, to ensure that they do not prevent your instance from working correctly.<span style="color: #eb7a3d;"><br/></span></p><p></p><p>For any variable element where "elem" is the variable.</p><pre __default_attr="javascript" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_macro_code _jivemacro_uid_1464039114702444 jive_text_macro" data-renderedposition="798.6363525390625_7.997159004211426_1192_93" jivemacro_uid="_1464039114702444"><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">if (elem === null)   //try this</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">//OR<br/></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">if (typeof elem === "undefined") //try this</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">//OR</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">if(elem === "")   //try this</span></p><p></p></pre><p></p><p>You should be running the above three checks on every variable in your software, scripts, and applications. You can put the above example in a function so you don't have to rewrite them.   Once in a function you can return anonymous functions to correctly handle the variable's error in a safe manner rather then breaking your interaction.</p><p></p><p>For example:</p><pre __default_attr="javascript" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_macro_code _jivemacro_uid_14640390833204099 jive_text_macro" data-renderedposition="991.3635864257812_7.997159004211426_1192_216" jivemacro_uid="_14640390833204099"><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">function isEmpty(elem){</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">       if (elem === null) {</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">               return function(){ alert("Is Null");};</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">       }</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">       else if (typeof elem === "undefined"){</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">               return function(){alert("IS UNDEFINED");}</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">       }</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">       else if(elem === ""){</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">               return function(){alert("IS EMPTY STRING");}</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">       }</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">       alert("NOT EMPTY");       </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">}</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">//This would be more helpful if your anonymous functions found alterior methods to notify the user of the issue or just found an entirely different work</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">//around to the error</span></p></pre><p></p><p>You can easily test this out in the developer console in Chrome, IE, or FireFox. You will see an error described by a red X.</p><p></p><p>For example:</p><p><img   alt="developer console.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="1b477fb1db5cdf04e9737a9e0f961975.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 284px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Unchecked variables cause all sorts of funny stuff to happen.   Unchecked variables are usually hard to find and cause the working of a page to halt.   Many Customers assume variables are just there and work correctly all of the time. The assumption that something should just exist without question, is dangerous and can affect your company's bottom line.</p><p>You own your instance and your source code, so you know what goes on inside of it.</p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Want to save yourself some time and possible headache? Double check the data you are working with.</h2>
