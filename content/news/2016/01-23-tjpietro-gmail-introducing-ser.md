<p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">If you've been following our </span><a _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=a5dca665dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961928"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">blogs</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">, you know what's new in Geneva, released Dec 8. I'm excited to tell you about Service 360 if you haven't heard about it yet. Service 360 fills a critical gap in the IT Executive's daily view of his/her organization.   We all know organizations today require that their IT be more agile, cost efficient and operate at the speed of the business. Having the right information at the right time has often been a challenge for IT Executives and business service owners. IT Executives want to be on top of things that keep their critical operations humming along:</span></p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Are my services operational?</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Are my services cost effective?</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Are my services governed?</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">These are traditionally difficult questions to answer given the complexity of the IT organization.   However, this has been made easy with ServiceNow's introduction of Service 360 with its Geneva release last month.   Here's some more information about how Service 360 can help you.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Using <strong>Service 360</strong> and Performance Analytics together enhances the quality of an organization's Service Portfolio by allowing executives and business service owners to quickly move from strategic to tactical by drilling down to specific records—all with just a few clicks. In fact, there are two reporting layers to <strong>Service 360</strong>:</span></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">1. </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> A dynamic treemap that is a D3 rendering of all business services across an entire organization based on a score from a specific Category and an Indicator from the Category.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2. </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">A dashboard, which is a scorecard, that leverages Performance Analytics to render reports from key performance indicators to provide a true 360-degree view into a single Business Service.</span></li></ol><p></p><p><img   alt="Layer 1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="f3912b71db9093041dcaf3231f96193c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 367px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p><img   alt="Layer2.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="523a8dc6db14130468c1fb651f96193b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 349px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The bottom-line: Service 360 demonstrates the power of leveraging the ServiceNow Platform by being able to pull data from several source solutions into one simple dynamic reporting dashboards. This allows IT executives to focus on resolving operational or risk issues along with viewing key financial or investments of business services with real-time data.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">For more information on <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/service_360/concept/c_Overview.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_360/concept/c_Overview.html">Service 360</a>, see:</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">ServiceNow product documentation:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/service_360/concept/c_Overview.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_360/concept/c_Overview.html">https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_360/concept/c_Overview.html</a></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">For general information about ServiceNow, visit: </span><a _jive_internal="true" href="/www.servicenow.com"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: blue;">www.servicenow.com</span></a></p>
