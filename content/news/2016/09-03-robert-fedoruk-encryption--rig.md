<p>Nearly a decade ago, my first ServiceNow project was integrating non-IT processes into onboarding/termination. Ever since, myself and others like me have pushed ServiceNow far beyond the realm of IT Service Management, legitimizing ServiceNow's "Everything as a Service" aspirations.     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">That rapid infiltration into all business silos has brought risks we're only now realizing.   "Trust in the cloud" has been a conversation dominated by questions of availability.   With 10 years of ServiceNow's peerless availability, the conversation should refocus on trusting safety of data.   Can we trust the cloud for safety?</span></p><p></p><p>The answer is a resounding no.   Just ask <a title="ww.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach">Drop Box</a>, <a title="ney.cnn.com/2015/07/20/technology/ashley-madison-hack/index.html" href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/20/technology/ashley-madison-hack/index.html">Ashley Madison</a>, <a title="ney.cnn.com/2014/12/09/technology/security/sony-hacking-roundup/index.html" href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/09/technology/security/sony-hacking-roundup/index.html">Sony</a>, <a title="w.recode.net/2016/8/9/12410386/recode-daily-oracle-hack" href="http://www.recode.net/2016/8/9/12410386/recode-daily-oracle-hack">Oracle</a>, <a title="w.csmonitor.com/Technology/Horizons/2012/0607/In-wake-of-LinkedIn-hack-Last.fm-confirms-data-breach" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/Horizons/2012/0607/In-wake-of-LinkedIn-hack-Last.fm-confirms-data-breach">Last.fm</a>, or the <a title="w.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-democrats-investigation-exc-idUSKCN1092HK" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-democrats-investigation-exc-idUSKCN1092HK">US Democratic Party</a>.</p><p></p><p>Before you point out not all of these were Cloud breaches, lets take a moment to observe the bigger lesson.   Be mindful of where &amp; how you store exploitable data.   In last generation's ITSM tools, the value of the data to infiltrators was tenuous, but lets look at 10 years of ServiceNow's horizontal expansion.</p><p></p><p><img alt="Image result for honey pot" class="jive-image" height="212" src="http://www.honeybeecentre.com/ProductPictures/gifts/Honeypot-3d-3-600.jpg" style="width: 212px; height: 212px;" title="Dip into a ServiceNow instance... find some absolutely delicious stuff" width="212"/></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Did someone say honeypot?)</span></p><p></p><h2><strong>SERVICE MAPPING</strong></h2><p>No question this new capability presents immense operational value.   The long dreamed of capability to map infrastructure to top level business services is within your grasp.   Now imagine the advantage intruders have if they can deconstruct your key business services down to the IP's of the devices supporting it.   You've just put the critical path for your business onto the Cloud in plain text.</p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" src="70e4ed4edb90df048c8ef4621f9619b8.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;" title="Dont mind me.

Non-Compete Negotiations</p><p>- Strategic Asset Procurement</p><p>- Supply Chain Management</p><p>- External Counsel Integrations</p><p>- Customer Experience Management</p><p>- Public facing UI pages</p><p></p><p>In each case, customers were concerned enough that the data hosted in the cloud would make ServiceNow a proverbial Honeypot, and in many cases the app interest died on the vine.</p><p></p><p><strong>Risk:</strong>   Increased risk <a title="w.riskythinking.com/glossary/annualized_loss_expectancy.php" href="http://www.riskythinking.com/glossary/annualized_loss_expectancy.php">loss expectancy and rate of occurrence</a> for actual business operations.</p><p></p><h1>What Now?</h1><p>ServiceNow long ago left its gestation of the ITSM space.   In so doing, we've put far more interesting and valuable data into the cloud.   It is now up to the responsible organization to assess how to protect that data from outside malice.   We can't control ServiceNow's (so far excellent) intrusion countermeasures, but we *can* control what the data looks like when it reaches the cloud.   To do so, we must have the encryption discussion.   I have recently had the opportunity to assess all major providers of encryption on ServiceNow, and not all solutions are created equal.   To help you reach the best possible decision, I've blogged about ways to evaluate your encryption provider.   My company is also here to assist you in maximizing your cloud data safety.</p><p></p><p>Further reading:</p><p><a title="Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;ed" __default_attr="4827" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;amp;ed" data-renderedposition="2927_8_246_16" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=35cd62e9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96190e">Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;ed</a></p><p><a title="Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;ed Part 2" __default_attr="4970" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;amp;ed Part 2" data-renderedposition="2948_8_287_16" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=b9cd62e9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961912">Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;ed Part 2</a></p><p><a title="Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;ed Part 3" __default_attr="5478" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;amp;ed Part 3" data-renderedposition="2969_8_287_16" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=b49ceae1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961980">Encryption: How not to get $#%&amp;ed Part 3</a></p><p></p><p><img   class="jive-image image-4" src="c49f7bf1db985704ed6af3231f961913.iix" style="max-width: 1200px;
