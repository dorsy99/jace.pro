We had some Webex issues with that session, and I was only able to share my screen for 20 minutes or so out of an hour session. Although I tried to talk through the features as best I could, it wasn't the same not being able to see my screen. The worst part is that I had a pretty compelling demo of an app I built in Service Portal. I got to show the fast forward version of that demo, but I really want to show it from the beginning to the end. This way you get to watch features start working a few lines of code at a time.</p><p></p><p>This make-up session will be live on July 14th, 2016 at 2 PM Eastern / 11 AM Pacific / a week from Saturday in Australia (check your local listings.) I will run back through all the demos from the original session but in a more leisurely fashion. This will be via Google Hangouts instead, and will automatically get a permanent YouTube recording so you can watch either way. The <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=e0adcf2ddb9cdbc01dcaf3231f9619b9">community post lives here</a> complete with an embed to watch the Hangout when it is live and/or the recorded video afterwards. If you want to ask questions, I'll address all of the ones from that thread during the session. The <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_event&sys_id=e8c4ba69dbdc5bc0b322f4621f961971">event post is here</a>, and if you register to attend you'll get notifications to help you remember to watch.</p><p></p><p>I look forward to presenting this session again. I'll have all the artifacts of my demo available that morning, so anyone who wants to recreate my application will be able to do so. I apologize to the many of you who tried to watch the original session and either couldn't hang with it or saw less demo than you wanted. We'll fix that this next time and it will be a barn burner!</p>
