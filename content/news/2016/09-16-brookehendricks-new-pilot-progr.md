<p>Select users will notice that the HI Service Portal incident form has a new look!   We have removed incident categories from the form during the incident submission process for selected Enterprise users.   Yes, that's right, select users that are randomly chosen to take part in this pilot program will not have to choose an incident category. As the tool improves, we'll increase the % of customers who experience the new feature.</p><p><img   alt="report an issue.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="19a9c846db509704ed6af3231f961910.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 470px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Why did we do remove incident category?</h2><p>We've gotten a lot of feedback that our categories are sometimes confusing for customers, and users are not always sure what to select.   In an effort to simply the user experience, we've eliminated them from the front end of submitting an issue into our Customer Support department.</p><p></p><h2>How will categories work now?</h2><p>Here is the exciting part! We <em>do</em> still need categories. Our internal teams use incident category to help classify and organize their work.   But, instead of customers manually selecting the category each and every time, we are using some very exciting new code to <em>automatically</em> assign the category based on keyword mappings.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tell me more!</strong></p><p>Our Emerging Products team has developed a product feature that we are using to model the keyword mapping. It's a machine learning system based on <a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Bayes theorem.</a>   Essentially, we ran the model against all of our historical incidents to 'teach' our system what incident category has historically applied to the keyword data we have, then, the next time an incident with similar keywords comes in, the system will automatically know which incident category is the best assignment.         Over time, the system learns and is updated.   If internal engineers manually adjust the category after the incident comes in, the system remembers it, and uses that new information to refine the modeling.   And voilí , we have a better customer experience, and hopefully more accurate categorizations upon submission.</p><p></p><p><strong>I want a classifier like this!</strong></p><p>We're still experimenting, but our hope is that the model will prove flexible enough for inclusion in the ServiceNow platform in the near future.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Tell us what you think!
