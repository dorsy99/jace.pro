<p>If your reports are not <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0553558" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0553558">displaying correctly under the My Reports section</a>, this may due to a recent change to your login information. If your user info has been changed in Fuji since you initially created the report, for example, you have a new primary email address and new username/login, these reports will not show up if you try to view <strong>My Reports.</strong></p><p></p><p>For example, if your username was once "Bridget" and you change it to "BridgetB," then the reports you created as Bridget do not show up. They appear missing when you log in with your new credentials and go to the report_home section to view your reports. The reason for this it that there is no longer a match between the [sys_user] and [sys_report] tables.</p><p></p><p>To view the reports you created from your previous username, you can have an admin manually edit the <strong>Created By</strong> field in the [sys_report] table with the new value of the username. You'll need an admin since this update requires a temporary change to the base system, which should then be reverted back once the update is complete. Here are the easy steps to do this:</p><p></p><h2>To enable list editing on the [sys_report] table:</h2><ol><li>In the navigation filter, enter <strong>System UI</strong>.<br/><img   alt="system_ui.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="d0f5d40edb545304b322f4621f9619a1.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 341px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></li><li>Go to<strong> List Control</strong>, and search for <strong>sys_report</strong>.</li><li>Open record and change the List edit type from <strong>Disable list editing</strong> to <strong>Save immediately (cell edit mode)</strong>.<br/><img   alt="List_control.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="e65677fddb9c9b048c8ef4621f96197b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 416px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></li><li>Navigate to the list view of the [sys_report] table and sort or filter by the <strong>Created By</strong> field. Replace the old username value with the new username value.<br/><br/><img   alt="Reports_Table.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="12765906db1c97049c9ffb651f96199b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 159px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></li><li>Go back to List Controls and set the List edit type value back to <strong>Disable list editing</strong> for the [sys_report] table.<br/><br/></li></ol><p>Although this works well for selected usernames, keep in mind that if you have thousands of records in the [sys_report] table where the username has been changed, then this workaround is probably not the best fit for a large volume of updates.</p><p></p><p>Having other issues with <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Reporting#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Reporting#gsc.tab=0">reporting</a>?
