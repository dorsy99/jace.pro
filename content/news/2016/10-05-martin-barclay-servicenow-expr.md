This means that Technology Partners with existing integrations on the ServiceNow Store for enterprise customers can expand their addressable market to include hundreds of   Express customers,   by creating a new version of their integration for Express. And existing or would-be partners   that cater to the Express customer profile can create new integrations that are aimed exclusively at this set of customers.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is the Express customer profile?</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; color: black;">Express customers are generally mid-sized organizations - starting in the 500-1K employee range through commercial (1K to 5K employees), and up to lower end enterprise market segments across all industry verticals. They are typically lower maturity in terms of ITSM/ITIL adoption and expertise than ServiceNow enterprise customers, for example in many cases are migrating from a home-grown or low-end point helpdesk/ticketing system.

Express customers are looking for quick easy to use solutions.</span></p><p></p><p class="05BodyCopy"><strong>What is the market opportunity?</strong></p><p>There are several hundred Express customers and this number is growing. Our customers have told us that they need certified integrations with key tools, apps, and data from 3rd party IT ISVs to help them get more out of Express and to be able to use the 3rd party software that they need to do their job better and deliver better service to their customers. Areas such as Incident Management, Help Desk Remote Support, Single Sign-On, and Asset Management are just a few examples of the areas where our customers are asking for ready-to-deploy integrations with leading 3rd party ISVs.</p><p></p><p><strong>How is ServiceNow generating Express customer awareness and demand for Certified Integrations?</strong></p><p>Express Certified Integrations are an important new feature/capability in the Istanbul release and as a result are afforded priority treatment in terms of Istanbul launch marketing content and messaging as well as ServiceNow sales enablement to ensure our sales team is aware of your integrations that can help our joint customers.
