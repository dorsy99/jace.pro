<p>So, the question has been asked: I can attach an article to an incident, but how can I see which incidents has been attached to a specific article. Before I go on, I would like to mention that I have only found this working with the Contextual Search Results which looks like this on a form:</p><p></p><p><img   class="image-3 jive-image" height="142" src="68d57882db989304b322f4621f9619f2.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 958px; height: 142.103px;" width="958"/></p><p>If you still use the old "book" that looks like this, and then pressing the "Attach to incident" button on the article.</p><p>Well, then you can stop reading, since then the rest of this article won't work.</p><p><img   class="jive-image image-4" height="57" src="64d79882db589fc03eb27a9e0f9619ef.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 957px; height: 57.42px;" width="957"/></p><p></p><p>But anyway, here we go.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Some may have found the table kb_use, which give a small bit of information on the articles and it looks like this:</p><p></p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" src="9accb00edb1c9304b322f4621f96190a.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p>Others might have found the related list "Knowledge   Use" that you can add on a article. It looks like this:</p><p><img   class="image-2 jive-image" src="f9b0e5c2db10d7049c9ffb651f96199c.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p></p><p>As you might notice it's pretty much the same. After a little bit of testing you will notice that if you press the attach-button</p><p><img   class="image-5 jive-image" height="113" src="0eb973b1db145fc03eb27a9e0f961931.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 842px; height: 112.968px;" width="842"/></p><p>you will then get a "true" on the Used column. But you will have no idea which article it has attached itself too.</p><p></p><p>Now, our luck has turned. There is another table that takes care of this and saves us some useful information.</p><p>That table is cxs_rel_doc_detail. There isn't so much information about it on the docs, but a quick search gives us this:</p><p>"Contains details of the search result record that users have indicated as useful or have attached to a form, as well as the search terms used to query the knowledge base."</p><p></p><p>Which shows us that we are on the right track here. looking at the columns we got info both on which article and which record it was attached to.</p><p><img   class="image-6 jive-image" height="248" src="40275106db58130468c1fb651f96193c.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 911px; height: 248.248px;" width="911"/></p><p></p><p>If you look at the column "Relevance type" you can see that it also saved information about the "this helped" function that you got on the articles. But right now we are focusing on the attach function.</p><p></p><p>Now, what's pretty annoying is that they have chosen almost identical column names for both the article and the record it got attached to. Only different is that document is spelled with capital letter on one and lowercase letter on the other one.</p><p>Well, the one with capital "Relevant Document" is the on carrying the sys_id of the record. Easier to see since the other one is not showing a sys_id.</p><p></p><p>Now, people in your organisation probably want to have a nice looking report to see instead of creeping around in tables and list views.</p><p></p><p>So I created a report, sadly I don't have so much demo data for it, so it doesn't look like much. But take this as a simple example.</p><p></p><p><img   class="image-7 jive-image" height="634" src="e088f886dbd097041dcaf3231f96194a.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 840px; height: 633.697px;" width="840"/></p><p></p><p>Well, that's all for today, hope this get you digging deeper into knowledge and all of its fun.</p>
