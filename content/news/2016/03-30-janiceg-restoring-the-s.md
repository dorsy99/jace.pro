<p>The script editor released in Fuji made authoring code much easier. With Geneva, scripting is even more intuitive and you can control, organize, and manage your scripts even more efficiently. Because scripts are such a useful and universal feature, you probably use the script editor frequently. When you create a UI policy, you see the script editor in the Advanced view. When you create a business rule, you load the script editor by selecting the Advanced option.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="advanced tab BR.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" src="114c3f75dbd01304b322f4621f961913.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 220px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Upon reload of the form, though, it vanishes: the Advanced option is selected but the editor is no longer there. In Fuji, specifically Fuji Patch 5, if you reload the business rule, the Advanced tab containing the script editor is <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563931" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563931">no longer visible.</a> This can lead to confusion because the script editor was just there a minute ago.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="ui policy advanced.jpg" class="image-4 jive-image" src="addc780edb1c9304b322f4621f961981.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 231px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>This problem also occurs when creating a UI policy.</p><p><img   alt="ui policy advanced policy.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="b1be9c0adbd85304b322f4621f961926.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 319px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>You can easily make the script editor visible again either by switching from the table you're on and then switching back or by deselecting the Advanced option and then selecting it again. This problem is fixed in Geneva so if you experience this issue in releases past Fuji Patch 5 and Geneva, please submit an incident so we can investigate.</p><p></p><h2>Additional Information</h2><ul><li>The script editor in Geneva has significant functionality upgrades to make the developer experience smoother and more productive, as <a title="dave.slusher" __default_attr="17468" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="dave.slusher" data-renderedposition="1283.800048828125_38_98_17" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=34225265dbd81fc09c9ffb651f96194b">dave.slusher</a> describes in <a title="What Developers Need to Know about Geneva: Part 2 - Script Editor" __default_attr="4961" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="What Developers Need to Know about Geneva: Part 2 - Script Editor" data-renderedposition="1283.800048828125_219.53334045410156_447_17" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=7e5de629dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961976">What Developers Need to Know about Geneva: Part 2 - Script Editor</a></li><li>For more about creating a business rule, see <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/script/business_rules/task/t_CreatingABusinessRule.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/script/business_rules/task/t_CreatingABusinessRule.html">Create a business rule</a> in the product documentation.</li><li>For more about creating a UI policy, see <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/administer/form_administration/task/t_CreateAUIPolicy.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/administer/form_administration/task/t_CreateAUIPolicy.html">Create a UI policy</a> in the product documentation.</li></ul>
