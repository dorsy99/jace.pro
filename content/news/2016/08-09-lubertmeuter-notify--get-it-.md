This is done via Twilio (third party) which allows you to buy a (local) number. In my case I use a Dutch, UK and US number. Please check before you buy your Twilio number if it can also send text message and the number is not restricted to domestic numbers only. (<a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings/international" title="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings/international">https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings/international</a> )</p><p>Once you have bought your number with some additional balance you are almost ready to go and start in your instance.</p><p>In your <strong>Twilio</strong> account you can find the "'<strong>Account SID</strong>" and "<strong>Auth Token</strong>" that are used in your instance.</p><p></p><p>2)</p><p>These plugins need to be active, so you can copy the URLs below and add your instance name or you can search for the Notify plugins and Incident Alert Management.</p><p>INSTANCE.service-now.com/v_plugin.do?sys_id=com.snc.notify (<strong>Notify</strong>)</p><p>INSTANCE.service-now.com/v_plugin.do?sys_id=com.snc.notify.twilio (<strong>Notify Driver)</strong></p><p>INSTANCE.service-now.com/v_plugin.do?sys_id=com.snc.iam (<strong>Incident Alert Management</strong>)</p><p></p><p>3)</p><p>Your instance must have your default number when it is triggered by an incidents (alert) or workflow. So let's add the Notify number in the sys properties. Find the <strong>glide.notify.task.phone_number</strong> record and add the number as value in the <a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164">E.164 compliant format</a>.</p><p>Each number you have must have "<strong>Number Groups</strong>". These groups contain the workflow that are being used for handling calls and messaging.</p><p></p><p><strong>When</strong> and <strong>why</strong> will you use Notify?</p><p>Notify's Incident Alert Management enables organizations to manage communications effectively and get the appropriate people engaged when a major business issue or incident occurs. After an incident alert is created, it is processed through a set of predefined states to ensure efficient and consistent handling. When an incident alert is resolved, a post incident review (PIR) meeting is initiated to review and learn from the issues that arose from the event. Stakeholders can monitor events and results with the incident alert dashboard and reports.
