I was eventually hired as a developer for OSU on the platform in 2013. In my student web development position for the Ohio State Tool team, I was initially introduced into using ServiceNow by creating catalog item forms and workflows. I learned through instruction and examples provided by senior members of the team. With their guidance and my own experimentation I was able to learn more about how to develop on the ServiceNow platform. After 2 years as a student employee, they hired me as a full time developer and admin before I had even graduated. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Visual Communication Design. Once hired, I was sent to ServiceNow admin training where I picked up a couple more skills and tricks.</em></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What application are you most proud of?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>Our time tracking application. Our department was previously using an application that had limitations and lacked flexibility. We began the search to find a new solution to track employee's hours on different projects. The solution chosen was ServiceNow's Time Card and Project applications. ServiceNow gave us more opportunity to customize the tool so it would fulfill the required business needs. Our team extended the functionality by developing a responsive web interface on our Self Service using AngularJS. This allowed employees to report their time easily from any device. We also created custom reports that made monthly reporting a lot easier for different departments. </em></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>How do you see ServiceNow changing the student experience? Â  </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>Students want things quickly and want multiple avenues to get help. ServiceNow improves the experience by streamlining the process and provides the integration capabilities to be a single source of information.</em></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What is your favorite aspect of developing on the platform?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>ServiceNow has a lot of handy functions and tools built into the platform. The extended functionality is helpful when scripting or writing new applications.</em></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What would be your dream application to develop?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>I love working on the CMS side.
