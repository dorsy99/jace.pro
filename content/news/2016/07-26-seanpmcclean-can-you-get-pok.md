The real value in both comes from their ability to give extremely different and broad range of people a common ground.   Something to start them communicating and collaborating.</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">So don't be intimidated by all the rules / details that the hard-core folks are dying to tell you about.   Just get the basics: </span></p><ul><li><span dir="ltr">It's based on a framework (for the ITIL framework, check <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/itil/blog/2011/08/08/1373">here</a>, or <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=ad4d2229dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961911">here</a>, or best yet, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=32cfb2addb58dbc01dcaf3231f96193d">here</a> - for Pokemon, well <a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">google it</a>)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">There are new technologies that are built around that framework that provide a common ground for collaboration, integration and communication (and for ITIL of course, I'm going to suggest you look a little deeper into <a title="w.servicenow.com/solutions/role/it.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/solutions/role/it.html">ServiceNow</a>)</span></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Now go out and get that Wild Weedle - I hear they're worth a lot of CP's (whatever that means…)</span></p>
