They look for a way to lower service costs, provide better service delivery performance, or gain greater access to key skill sets.   However, the results of these initiatives have often fallen short of these goals.   This is due to having </span><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-style: inherit;">no insight into supplier performance and an inflexible services supply chain</span><span style="font-style: inherit;">. In short, the complexity of managing multiple suppliers gets in the way of achieving the results they need.   </span></span></span></p><div class="jive-blog-post-message"><div><p style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #666666;"><span style="background-color: #fffefe; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span></p><p style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #666666;"><span style="background-color: #fffefe; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">However, many customers are discovering they can build a Service Integration layer based upon a SIAM framework in ServiceNow.     Doing so enables them to integrate all of their internal and external services into a single, cohesive business-facing IT organization.     They get comprehensive views into overall service performance.   This enables them to drive faster, more accurate service delivery. As well, they gain negotiating leverage with suppliers through performance analytics that help them hold all parties accountable and provide the right incentives for collaboration. </span></p><div style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: #fdfcfc; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br/></span><p></p><p style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12pt;">Let's use this community to ask questions, discuss different approaches to address issues, offer insights and share best practices.</span></p><p style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #666666;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span></p><p style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #666666;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Welcome to the Service Integration and Management Community — we are delighted to have you here! </span></p><p></p></div></div></div>
