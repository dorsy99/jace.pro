<p>We're finding that there's an overlap between this space and the <a __default_attr="2100" __jive_macro_name="community" class="jive_macro_community jive_macro" data-orig-content="Knowledge Management" data-renderedposition="10_415.109375_180_16" href="undefined2100" modifiedtitle="true" title="Knowledge Management ">Knowledge Management</a> space under the Discuss &gt; Service Automation Platform &gt; Knowledge Management. In an effort to make sure things are easy for you to find in the community, we're going to merge those two areas.</p><p></p><p>All of the content from the KM SIG will still exist, it'll just be migrated to the KM space linked above. We'll still blog about our implementation and discuss best practices, but we'll do it that space instead.</p><p></p><p>You'll notice the change happen within the next few weeks.</p><p></p><p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
