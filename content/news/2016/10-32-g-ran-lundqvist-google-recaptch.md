<p>Today I will be covering how to use Google reCAPTCHA on a form that is in the Service Portal. There might be occasions where this is needed and for myself it was because we had a form that was open to use even if you weren't logged on.</p><p></p><p>So I started test a lot and trying to learn how do use the reCAPTCHA, since I never used it before <span __jive_emoticon_name="happy" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="71_626_16_16" src="/8.0.4.21bdc7e/images/emoticons/happy.png"></span></p><p>I quickly realized that this post would have been very long to describe what I do, so instead I made my very first video. So lets just say that there is a couple of things that I can improve on the video arena.</p><p></p><p>Before you look at the video I just wanted to say that I don't show it in the video, but I have created a custom table that I use that is called u_wishlist and it has two fields(u_name &amp; u_wish).</p><p>I've tried to divide the video in the following parts:</p><p></p><p>1. Create widget and dependency with google api</p><p>2. Create the HTML Template</p><p>3. Create the Client Controller</p><p>4. Create the REST Message</p><p>5. And for last the Service Script</p><p></p><p>So, here comes my first video.</p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/BYPIBVDGLmo" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Take care,</p><p>GÃ¶ran</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Symfoni Logo Color Box.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="56" src="d3aca0c2db18dfc03eb27a9e0f9619f3.iix" style="width: 192px; height: 55.6522px;" width="192"/><img  alt="sn-community-mvp.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="6689cccadbdc5fc068c1fb651f9619f0.iix" style="width: auto; height: auto;"/></p>
