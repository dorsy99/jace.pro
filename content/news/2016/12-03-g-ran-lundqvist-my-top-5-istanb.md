<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">We finally got to get Istanbul to our personal developer instance and it was just to dive in.</span></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">This post will be a quick overview of the 5 big things that I think will rock your world with the Istanbul release. My main hopes are that I can follow up this post with a more deep dig post about each function/application.</span></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">So let's skip the small talk and get to business.</span></p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Automated Test Framework:</span></h2><p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">We all been struggling with testing and now ServiceNow has giving us something to start with. There are great companies out there which has their main focus on this subject and I still think that their products are more advanced than this, but this is a great start for those who got nothing and want to start looking into what they can do and at least have some test automated to get the feeling on how their road ahead looks like.</span> </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"><img  alt="test done.JPG" class="image-1 jive-image" height="211" src="503b9546db1cd344e9737a9e0f96192b.iix" style="width: 596px; height: 211.484px;" width="596"/></span></p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">CAB Workbench:</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Need to activate this plugin to get the workbench going: Change Management - CAB Workbench, at least if you upgrade from an older release.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">This is a workbench that will give the life the Change Manager a much better way to have it all in one place. As you notice when you go in here this UI is built with a Service Portal which then might give you all a good idea of the power you can do with the Service Portal. Here then CM can schedule meetings, send out invitations etc. When the meeting is live, you have all the records you need in one place and you can even make functions like ServiceNow will send out a Connect message to the people whose change is coming up next etc.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"><img  alt="CAB workbench.JPG" class="image-2 jive-image" height="303" src="34a8f4c6dbd097041dcaf3231f9619bd.iix" style="width: 583px; height: 303.724px;" width="582"/><br/></span></p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">ServiceNow Benchmarks:</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Now if your company wants it, you can join the SeviceNow Benchmarks and compare yourself to other companies that is using ServiceNow. You can choose to drill down and compare to companies within the same industry, same size etc. And of course this is a voluntary. If you don't want to do it, you don't share your data either with others. But if you want to compare, you need to let others compare to you. Now this is going to be a part of the HI portal, so it isn't   something that you do from your instance.   You need to login to HI to access these numbers. But It will be nice to be able to see how for example you MTTR is compared to others. Is it so bad that you think, or perhaps it's a lot better than most of your fellow companies?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">Since this is in HI and I ain't a customer anymore, this is sadly something I can't dig deeper in at the moment. But I bet there will be other posts about this from people who can give you more insight than me.</span></p><p></p><h2><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">Anomaly metrics:</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">Now in ITOM and Event management we got something called Anomaly Metrics. You can start looking at your CIs and identify anomalous behaviors and stop bad things from happening before it get real messy. Of course you can get a nice good graphics map over the those CIs that have gotten the highest anomaly score over a time span. And the hero of this data is the Operational Metrics that goes throw all that chunk of historical metrics data from example SCOM.</span></p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> B2C in Customer Service Management:</span></h2><p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">They have now gone from B2B (Business To Business) and added B2C (Business To Consumers). Focusing on helping companies that handles the bigger crowd of anonymous consumers that may not always be a registered user in your company. Having the ability to have a anonymous chat and a portal that is made to be more suitable for the B2C needs.   To get the portal you need to activate the plugin "Consumer Service Portal". </span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;"><img  alt="consumer portal.PNG" class="image-3 jive-image" height="197" src="acf5dc0edb589704ed6af3231f9619b1.iix" style="width: 512px; height: 198.194px;" width="512"/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">Now these are just a few of the new features in Istanbul and it wasn't easy to pick out just 5 and I think that a lot of you have other favorites which I love to hear about.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">Take Care,</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;">Göran</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial;"><img  alt="Symfoni-Logo-Color (1).png" class="image-4 jive-image" height="53" src="0dc9b379db14d3049c9ffb651f961937.iix" style="width: 230px; height: 53.4194px;" width="229"/><img  alt="advocate.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="399b9982db14d7041dcaf3231f961980.iix" style="height: auto;"/></span></p>
