The risk of female veterans becoming homeless is four times greater than that of male veterans.   Similarly the unemployment rate for military spouses is at 26% (much higher than the general public) and a full 96% of spouses are considered underemployed.   </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Given the reality of today's economy of the two- income family to make ends meet   - it is critical to provide all veterans, women veterans and military spouses   with training that leads to viable careers   with opportunities for advancement and job security.   A career in technology provides a promising and lasting pathway to familial financial security. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">NPower is committed to building brighter futures for veterans and spouses by providing access and opportunity to tech skills to help them achieve their potential.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">NPower, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Brooklyn, NY with offices is northern California, North Texas, Toronto and New Jersey,<br/>provides a free </span><a href="http://www.npower.org/Our-Programs/Technology-Service-Corps.aspx"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Technology Service Corps</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> training program to veterans and military spouses to learn the skills needed to assume jobs in the tech<br/>industry.
