<p>Hello everyone.   My name is Justin Bauguess and I will be speaking about automated testing for developers on Thursday, May 19th at 1:30 pm in Mandalay Bay E.   The session id is 19CB01.</p><p></p><p>I've posted numerous blog posts about automated browser testing and server side unit testing.   You can read those <a title="ugs.wordpress.com/" href="http://baugs.wordpress.com/">here</a>.   Of course, there is far more than 50 minutes of content in those posts, so in my presentation at K16, I plan to hit some highlights, which include basic setup and configuration options, and how to write tests.   So far in my practice runs, I've been hitting between 35 and 40 minutes of actual presentation, to leave plenty of time to answer any specifics anyone has.</p><p></p><p>The realm of automated testing, particularly driving the browser, presents an interesting set of challenges.   There are lots of configuration options, which can be overwhelming at first.   While I focus on a distinct set of tools, frameworks, and methods, hopefully the concrete examples I provide can help you push forward in an automated testing effort if you are either stuck (like I used to be) or completely without automation (again, like I used to be).   If you are somewhere in the range of no automation for testing to on the verge of automation for testing, my presentation is for you.   If you are convinced you don't need testing automation, my presentation is also for you.   If you have lots of testing automation already (and I'd define lots as several hundred tests, spanning multiple applications/modules), you probably won't gain a ton from my presentation, but I'd still welcome any input or questions you have.</p><p></p><p>I'll have two update sets available for download along with my presentation.   The first is my server side unit testing framework, which is similar to any XUnit testing you may have done.   I've written a demo on how to use it, which is available on my blog.   This is easy to set up, and incredibly useful.   That update set also has QUnit for ui pages to test client side code.   That's also really easy to set up and use.</p><p></p><p>The other update set will provide an easy way to make Java page objects used for automated browser testing.   It makes pages that work in Fuji and earlier.   I recently started testing Geneva, and noticed an issue with journal fields.   I'll update my page object generator in the near future to account for this change.</p><p></p><p>I hope to see you on Thursday to discuss how automated testing can help you, how to set it up, and any issues or problems you may have had with it.   And should you stop by, I'd also like to thank you in person for watching the fine shows we make at Scripps Networks Interactive (HGTV, Food Network, DIY, Cooking Channel).   I don't work on the shows.   But I work in IT as a software developer for our ServiceNow Delivery Team, so I understand our viewers are what keep me employed!</p><p></p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana-Bold;"><strong>Justin Bauguess </strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: #666666;">|Software Developer</span></p><p></p><p><a href="mailto:jbauguess@scrippsnetworks.com" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5;" title="mailto:jbauguess@scrippsnetworks.com">jbauguess@scrippsnetworks.com</a></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana-Bold;"><strong>SCRIPPS NETWORKS </strong></span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: #666666;">| the Leader in Lifestyle Media | scrippsnetworks.com</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: #666666;">HGTV | DIY Network | Food Network | Cooking Channel | Travel Channel | Great American Country</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: #666666;"><img   alt="brands.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="c43c1006dbd81f048c8ef4621f96190e.iix" style="height: auto;"/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: #666666;"><img   alt="sni_logo.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="1f6bf33ddb901304b322f4621f961967.iix" style="height: auto;"/></span></p>
