A ServiceNow 'veteran' of some five years now, Tripathi is rightly honored as a ServiceNow MVP. @@</span></p><p><img  alt="servicenow-mvp.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="5722c8cadb985fc068c1fb651f961926.iix" style="height: auto; float: right;"/></p><p><span style="color: #222222;">I caught up with Tripathi during the London 2016 leg of the firm's recent NowForum event series.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #222222;"><strong>Most valued (professional) person</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #222222;">ServiceNow MVPs are 'most valued' due to their status as elite</span> technical individual contributors who have demonstrated a commitment to engage, guide and share expertise with their peers.</p><p></p><p>Working to deliver the ServiceNow platform for a large, multinational banking customer, <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi is a Java developer by trade. As such, he uses JavaScript to </span>create the job-specific functionality that he needs for the bank's back-end systems.</p><p></p><p>"The front end of ServiceNow is highly customizable, so it is very easy for us to build in new scripts when we need to. This inherent flexibility in ServiceNow allows us to incorporate whatever technologies we need, such as the AngularJS open source web application framework and much more," said <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Fluid, flexible &amp; fruitful</strong></p><p></p><p>When he first came to use the ServiceNow platform some half a decade ago, <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi found that the onboarding and learning processes were easy to use, fluid and effective. Citing the wealth of ServiceNow </span>tutorials and educational reference materials that the firm makes available, <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi now takes a lead in training new recruits on the ServiceNow platform at Capgemini.</span></p><p></p><p>On the question of how much Capgemini ends up giving back to the Java community when working with ServiceNow implementations, <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi explains that his team will often blog to detail process and strategy when they have found an effective way around a technical roadblock of one kind or other.</span></p><p></p><p>"Many custom applications are needed for a large, multinational bank and we are currently building one very complex element that will help a lot with automation-focused tools to increase productivity, all while sticking close to the need for governance," said <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi. </span></p><p></p><p>"Our bank customer has millions of devices (servers, computers and other componentry) that periodically need to be updated around the world. We are working to create the intelligence to provide patching and updates with a strong automation element," he added.</p><p></p><p><strong>Broad ServiceNow platform scope</strong></p><p></p><p>The Capgemini team has worked closely with ServiceNow throughout every project undertaken. Initially focused on technologies to serve resource management goals, Capgemini has naturally progressed with the total ServiceNow stack to address features and functions, including demand management, vendor management and contract management.</p><p></p><p>"It does not necessarily need to be pure IT functions that we use ServiceNow for. This is a broad platform with massive scope," said <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi.</span></p><p></p><p>Overall, <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi reinforces the features through which </span>ServiceNow has allowed his team to gain speed in their day-to-day workflows and reduce the chance of manual errors. Employing key use of ServiceNow Workflow and Visual Task Boards, Capgemini is currently looking to integrate more direct use of the ServiceNow Connect collaboration layer into its processes and execution strategies.</p><p></p><p><strong>Objective advocate, automation enthusiasm Â  </strong></p><p></p><p>"The ServiceNow developer community is friendly and it's always good to walk into a room where the people know you as a result of your reputation for working with the product inside the group," said <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi</span></p><p></p><p>Looking ahead, <span style="color: #222222;">Tripathi says he would like to use ServiceNow as a leverage point to bring 'even more' </span>self-service automation into the technology platforms he works across. Recognizing that the <span style="color: #222222;">ServiceNow stack itself is growing all the time, Tripathi also says that this is part of the overall appeal.</span></p><p></p><p>"The ServiceNow platform is changing very fast and developers often complain that they are bored of doing the same thing over and over. Working with ServiceNow means that there is always a lot of diversity," he concluded.</p><p></p><p><strong>ServiceNow HackNow 2016</strong></p><p></p><p>Developers interested in working more directly with ServiceNow on its software engineering streams can register here <a title="ackathon.service-now.com/hacknow?id=uk_2016" href="https://hackathon.service-now.com/hacknow?id=uk_2016">https://hackathon.service-now.com/hacknow?id=uk_2016</a> for the London 2016 ServiceNow Hackathon.</p><p></p><p>This single day event brings together individuals and teams who would not normally collaborate or are bound by the barriers of time, distance and function.
