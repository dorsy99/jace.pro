<p>In versions of ServiceNow prior to Geneva, the <strong>SNC_Component</strong> class was an essential part of a ServiceNow instance. The SNC_Component class contains <strong>CIs</strong> that reference each of the nodes within the instance, and "components" such as physical disk, and logical disk volume information for each node in the Instance.To be brutally honest, these records are of no interest to customers. These records are stored in the <strong>CMDB,</strong> and are used for the normal operation of the Instance.</p><p></p><p>For example; the JRobin Database used to obtain the Performance Metrics (*as used for the ServiceNow Performance Graphs) rely on these CI records, to establish information concerning each node in the Instance. However, because this information is stored within the structure of the <strong>CMDB</strong>, the <strong>CIs</strong> are often retrieved in reports and CI lists, and this can cause confusion from customers, who are totally unaware of the existence of these CI records, and of their purpose.</p><p></p><p><span>As a result; Technical Support often receive incidents concerning the <strong>SNC_Component</strong> records, with the following questions:</span></p><ol><li>What is a SNC_Component class configuration item (CI)?</li><li>Is if it is safe to delete these records?</li></ol><p></p><p>So I thought, I'd give you some context around the purpose of these records and explain their usage, and why it is important to "<strong>leave them alone</strong>"!</p><p></p><h2>SNC_Component Configuration Item</h2><p>The SNC_Component Class in the CMDB uses a table called cmdb_ci_snc_component and a class called SNC_Component. The CIs that reside in this table contain CI references to your ServiceNow Instance Nodes (and components such as physical disk, and logical disk volume), and these are used by the JRobin Database, for the metrics as used for the ServiceNow Performance Graphs.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="snc component.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7ccd7c46db5c9304b322f4621f961919.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 164px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Deleting SNC_Component records</h2><p>Many customers ask if these records can be deleted, as they are unaware of their purpose, and because they are showing up in reports/lists etc... In releases pre-Geneva, we DO NOT recommend deletion of these records.</p><p></p><p>As previously indicated; the JRobin Database, used to obtain the Performance Metrics (*as used for the ServiceNow Performance Graphs) rely on these CI records, to establish information concerning each node in the Instance. If these records are deleted, it will stop the Performance Metrics from being collected, and should you attempt to review the performance graphs, you will receive a "<strong>No Metrics Available"</strong> error message.</p><p></p><p>Even if you do delete these records, like the proverbial "bad penny" they'll keep turning up; as these records are recreated (if they no longer exist) when the instance is next restarted.</p><p></p><p>The best advice I can give to you is to leave them alone to do their job, and just filter out the <strong>Class: SNC_Component</strong> in any reports, list filters, etc. that you require. For more information information on this CI see <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0552080" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0552080">SNC_Component Class CIs | CMDB</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Post-Geneva Behaviour:</h2><p>As of the Geneva Release, the Node and "component" information has been moved onto their own standalone table, outside of the CMDB structure. Therefore, the use of the table: <strong>cmdb_ci_snc_component</strong> is now deprecated.</p><p></p><p>The data that was previously stored in the table: <strong>cmdb_ci_snc_component </strong>is now stored in the standalone table: <strong>snc_monitorable_item</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Instances that have been upgraded from previous versions may still have the <strong>cmdb_ci_snc_component</strong> table present in the database. In these instances, the data is no longer used, and the records in the <strong>cmdb_ci_snc_component</strong> table can be safely deleted if required, and they will not get recreated on an instance restart. This table will not exist in freshly provisioned instances.</p><p></p><p><strong>Please Note:</strong> </p><p>If you have deleted the CIs in the <strong>cmdb_ci_snc_component</strong> table after upgrading to Geneva (or other higher versions), and the CIs get re-created, it is quite possible that the Script Include: <strong>InstanceStats</strong> may have been skipped during the Instance upgrade. Please check your Instance Upgrade History and if necessary use the [Revert to Out-of-box] UI Action to ensure that the script is on the correct version. </p><p></p><p><strong>WARNING!</strong></p><p>In Geneva+ Instances; records in the <strong>snc_monitorable_item</strong> table should <strong>NOT</strong> be deleted. If these records are deleted, it will affect the performance metric data etc... and the records will be re-created on an instance reboot should they not exist. Please leave these records alone!</p>
