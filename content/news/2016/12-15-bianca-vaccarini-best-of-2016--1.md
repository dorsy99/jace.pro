<p>While the community is a great resource for customer testimonials and unconventional solutions around the platform, the Knowledge Base is home for ServiceNow-created content. In the Knowledge Base you can count on the information coming straight from the source. That being said, you may not always get the news you want to hear from us in the KB, as opposed to a "workaround" shared on the community. Of course, always approach with caution when venturing into <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=666d2e29dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96195e">your own customizations</a>.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="The best of 2016 KB.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="83cf633ddb98dfc0b322f4621f9619c8.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 310px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h1>10 most popular Knowledge articles of 2016</h1><ol><ol><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0564465" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0564465">Incident Management State Model | New in Helsinki </a></h2><p>The Helsinki release was one of ServiceNow's peaks of 2016. With Helsinki came new features, apps and changed abilities not available in previous versions. One feature that caught your eye was the new Incident Management State Model. There were a few quirks of Incident Management State Model that required a bit of context. In <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0564465" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0564465">ServiceNow KB: Incident Management State Model (new in Helsinki) (KB0564465)</a> you received details on script includes for the state model and how to map from the old state model to the new state model.</p></li><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0520375" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0520375">Deleting or editing a bad comment or work note from a record task</a></h2><p>Nothing is worse than having sensitive information posted for all the public to see. You wanted to know how you could delete or edit a bad comment or work note, and in <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0520375" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0520375">ServiceNow KB: Deleting or editing a bad comment or work note from a record (KB0520375)</a> you find out how. You can update the journal entry in the [sys_journal_field] table and the audit entry in the [sys_audit] table to work around it. This should be used as a backup method. Your first course of action should be to educate your team on what is OK and not OK to share in a public comment as well as qualities of a helpful work note.</p></li><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563889" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563889">SLA timings may not be up to date when the workflow generates events for notifications</a></h2><p>Workflows for a Task SLA record are used to create events when certain SLAs have been reached. In the event that another activity is kicked off using the Task SLA information, you may see that your information is wrong or out of date. This affected Eureka and Geneva patches and one Fuji patch. In <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563889" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563889">ServiceNow KB: Task SLA timings may not be up to date when the workflow generates events for notifications (KB0563889)</a>, you learn how to work around this issue with the tip that you remove it after upgrading to Helsinki.</p></li><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563834" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563834">Labels above sets of checkbox variables are no longer automatically hidden when the checkboxes are all hidden</a></h2><p>You would think if you hide a set of checkboxes that they title of the section the checkboxes fall under would go into hiding too, right? Well some of you found otherwise and needed a way to hide the labels above hidden checkbox variables. In <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563834" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563834">ServiceNow KB: Labels above sets of checkbox variables are no longer automatically hidden when the checkboxes are all hidden (KB0563834)</a>, we outline how you can identify if it's affecting you and what release you can upgrade to in order to work around it.

In the case of a missing script editor, it could save you some grief. You can try switching tables or editing the Advanced option as a means to refresh it. This should allow the script editor to appear as expected. This quirk affects just a few patches in Fuji as listed in <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563909" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563909">ServiceNow KB: Loading data for history view can cause severe performance issues (KB0563909).</a></p></li><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563744" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563744">Error causes gauge to not render or 'disappear'</a></h2><p>Now you see it. Now you don't. That is, if you are using a non-<a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII character </a>on the gauge. When a non-ASCII character is entered into a field (e.g. last work note, description) of a record that would display on a gauge for a list report, the gauge disappears upon reload of the homepage. I am guessing a few of you rebels were veering away from using ASCII characters. This quirk affects a few patches in Geneva and Fuji, listed in <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563744" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563744">ServiceNow KB: Error causes gauge to not render or 'disappear' (KB0563744).</a></p></li><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563911" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563911">Scheduled jobs for Event Management are not cleaned up due to a 40-character limitation</a></h2><p>On Twitter, we feel limited by 140 characters. Imagine being confined to a 40-character limit. The 40-character limitation could prevent scheduled jobs on the Event Management application from being cleaned up. Don't worry, you just need to put on your thinking cap and rename the connectors with names that are 20 characters or less.</p></li><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549558" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549558">MID Server not able to connect to instance - WS-Security header error</a></h2><p>You can <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/integrate/inbound-soap/task/t_EnableWS-SecurityVerification.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/integrate/inbound-soap/task/t_EnableWS-SecurityVerification.html">enable WS-Security header verification</a> for all incoming SOAP requests.
