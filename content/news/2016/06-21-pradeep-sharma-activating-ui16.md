<p>UI16 is the latest UI, included started in Geneva. UI16 provides usability improvements and design changes, including an enhanced application navigator, color themes, and a refreshed knowledge base that delivers a more modern style to help drive user efficiency and productivity.That means if you just received your instance from ServiceNow and it is running on Geneva, you do not need to activate the plugin to get UI16, because it is active OOB. For instances upgrading from a lower version (pre-Geneva), you will need to activate the UI16 plugin (com.glide.ui.ui16) manually. As long as you have the admin role, activating UI16 after upgrading to Geneva or newer version, is a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Before you begin hunting around for the plugin to activate, confirm that you have successfully completed the upgrade of your instance by visiting the upgrade monitor (<strong>System Diagnostics &gt; Upgrade Monitor</strong>).   When your upgrade is complete, it will display statistics on the most recent upgrade, including start and end date and a green message will appear saying it was a success.</p><p><img   alt="upgrade success.jpg" class="image-7 jive-image" src="bd212d46db50df048c8ef4621f96193b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 226px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h1>To activate UI16 in your upgraded instance</h1><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>System Definition&gt;Plugins</strong>.<p><span style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><img   alt="search plugin.jpg" class="image-4 jive-image" src="7930cd8edbd497041dcaf3231f961985.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 119px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></span></p></li><li>Search for UI16 plugin (com.glide.ui16)<br/><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img   alt="UI16 plugin.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="d5006886dbdc9fc03eb27a9e0f9619b6.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 386px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></span></p></li><li>Open the plugin record.</li><li>Click on related link "Activate/Upgrade"</li><li>Click <strong>Activate</strong> to activate the plugin.</li><li>Click on "Close and Reload Form" once you see the success message popup.</li><li>Click the gear icon in the banner frame to open the <strong>System Settings</strong> window.</li><li>Click "Switch to UI16"<p style="text-align: left;"><img   alt="switch to ui16.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" height="503" src="0b0d37f1dbd45fc068c1fb651f961981.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 522px; height: 502.635483870968px;" width="522"/></p></li></ol><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">Just to emphasize, after you have enabled the plugin, you must also complete step 8! Which means after enabling, you must tell your instance to "Switch to UI16" or you will continue to see UI15. <span style="text-align: center;">If you do not see the ability to switch between UIs and the   "Switch to UI16" button is not available see </span><a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0564468" style="text-align: center;" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0564468">ServiceNow KB: The "Switch to UI16" button is not visible (KB0564468)</a></p><p></p><h2>Switching between UI15 and UI16</h2><p>After UI16 is activated, you may need to view the changes in both versions of user interface.
