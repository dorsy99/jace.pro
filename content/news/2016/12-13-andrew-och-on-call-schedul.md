<p>The Repeat Until attribute on Schedule Entries provides a way to alter the start and/or end time of a rota and how it repeats.</p><p><img  alt="schema.png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="0afceb79db18dfc0b322f4621f9619ff.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p>Imagine a scenario where from a particular date, rotations should change from 8am-5pm to 9am-6pm i.e. moving forward by one hour. To do this, simply create a new Schedule Entry with the new hours 9am-6pm. The old schedule entry should have its Repeat Until field populated with the last time the 8am-5pm rota should apply, in the example below that is 2016-05-11. The new Schedule Entry should have a Start Date time of the following day, 2016-05-12 along with the new start time of 9am and end time of 6pm as shown below.</p><p><img  alt="repeatUntilStartDateTime.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="77baa77ddb94dfc0b322f4621f9619c0.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 122px;"/></p><p>Note, if the Repeat Until date of the old Schedule Entry and the Start Date Time of the new Schedule Entry are on the same day, you will receive an error about overlapping spans as shown in below.</p><p><img  alt="calendarScheduleOverlapErr.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="e0be8106db94130468c1fb651f9619f3.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 71px;"/></p><p>As long as your Schedule entries do not overlap you will should see the rotation change in the calendar, as with the example below changing on 2016-05-12 to the new rota time of 9am-6pm.</p><p><img  alt="calendarRotaTimeChange.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="a303144adb1817049c9ffb651f961994.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 342px;"/></p>
