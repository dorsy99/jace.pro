<p>Today we're featuring <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=d1f0d2a1db981fc09c9ffb651f96196f">Mike Allen</a>, Lead Technical Specialist at a large financial institution, <span style="background: white;">as our next </span><a _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=24fda22ddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961903"><span style="background: white;">#IAmACreator</span></a><span style="background: white;">. </span></p><p></p><p><strong>Tell us how you learned about and started developing on ServiceNow?<br/> </strong><em>About 5 years ago, my manager and I were talking about our current toolset and the future of it.   I offered to take responsibility of our monitoring tool, but he said he saw me more as a developer of the new ITSM tool, ServiceNow.   Two weeks later, I was in Chicago taking a class, and the rest is history.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>How has being a ServiceNow developer shaped or helped your career? <br/> </strong><em>Before ServiceNow, I was an engineer, working primarily on Windows servers, with some database work thrown in.   I worked at an MSP, so it was never dull, but it was never truly what I wanted to do. Once I started developing in ServiceNow, my career took off.   I found something that I love doing, and it turns out I am pretty good at doing it. Where I was unexcited about going to work, now I look forward to the challenges presented on a daily basis. Working at a multi-national company with a huge amount of process users, my job is something that never disappoints, and it is all thanks to ServiceNow and that former manager for setting me on the path.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>What projects are you most proud of? <br/> </strong><em>I generally provide enhancements to existing applications to meet stakeholder expectations.   In the Incident module, I have created some things that I am very proud of: a UI Page that our incident managers use as a dashboard, giving them current information on their high-priority incidents in an easy and accessible way.   This pulls information from multiple sources and provides a colorful screen that allows them to know the status of any incident at a glance in a war room.</em></p><p><em>I also create integrations between ServiceNow and external tools.   This allows users to see real-time and historical metrics on devices from the record they are working.   Utilizing UI Macros, I pass the information to the external tool and present the relevant data to the end user.</em></p><p></p><p><strong> What impact did it have on the business? How did your app change the way that work gets done? <br/> </strong><em>The mean time to fix of high priority issues decreased. The ability to analyze historical data from a server was reduced to a single click.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>How do you see ServiceNow changing the employee or user experience? <br/> </strong><em>The automation afforded to the tool makes the job of the employee easier.   The robustness of the tool allows for there to be a single experience, rendering third-party tools a thing of the past. One place to do all your work.</em></p><p></p><p><strong> What is your favorite aspect of developing on the platform? <br/> </strong><em>I can literally do anything my stakeholders want, no matter how crazy the requirement.   I have never found something asked of me that I just could not do.</em><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p><strong><img   alt="SVN-CloudCampaign-041416-1200x628-v1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="c47391c6db9897049c9ffb651f9619f6.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 324px;"/></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>What's your tip for a new ServiceNow developer? <br/> </strong><em>Use the tools at your disposal.   There are sites out there put up by users, sites run by ServiceNow, and a huge amount of knowledge in the community.   Use them. Don't be afraid to ask questions.</em></p><p></p><p><span style="background: white;">Become a Creator and change the way work is done.
