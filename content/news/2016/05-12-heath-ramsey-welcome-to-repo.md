  You can with In-Form Analytics.   Now everyone can see developing trends in the requests they are working and proactively take action to ensure the organization meets service goals and objectives.</p><p><br/> In-Form Analytics is easily configurable through a built-in user interface, and the analysis can be applied to just about any field in any form.   Each dashboard is completely configurable to present the most meaningful information to your staff working the requests.   In-Form Analytics extends the value of Performance Analytics to every stakeholder in your process and ensures everyone is aligned in driving organizational performance.</p><p><img   alt="inform.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="5af19586dbd4130468c1fb651f961999.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 283px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Dashboard Live Updating</h2><p></p><p>Have you ever wanted a real-time dashboard that updates the data automatically?   Have you been frustrated with having to refresh the page and potentially wait for the new data to display on the screen?   Do you worry that you don't have access to the most accurate, up-to-date information on your dashboards?   Worry no more.   Helsinki comes with new report widgets that automatically update in real time as the data in the platform changes.</p><p></p><p>See when new critical incidents are added to the queue.   Know when high priority HR cases come in.   Act when new CIs are created in the CMDB that do not have all of the necessary data.   And make the data available to all stakeholders in real-time so that everyone is up to date.</p><p><img   alt="live.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="012ee48adb5c57041dcaf3231f9619a1.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 263px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Responsive Canvas</h2><p></p><p>In the past, you have been limited in how dashboard widgets and report gauges are displayed on a page.   You had just a few columns, and you had to shoehorn everything into a limited amount of space.   It was difficult making your visualizations flow the way you wanted them to.</p><p></p><p>Enter the Responsive Canvas in Helsinki—now you have the power to create beautiful, eye-catching dashboards quickly and easily. New visualizations are available to you on the responsive canvas (including geo maps and an improved calendar) that you can easily move and resize how you want.   You are no longer limited by arbitrary columns and boundaries on the page.</p><p></p><p>Let your creativity flow and build the kinds of dashboards all of your stakeholders want to use and interact with.   It will keep them coming back for more.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="map.png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="5e186bbddb9493041dcaf3231f96194e.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 322px;"/></p><p></p><h2>Integrated Mobile UI</h2><p></p><p>As you give the power of data to more people, they are going to want more ways to access that information to take action. Literally put the power of data into users' hands with the fully integrated Mobile UI.   With Helsinki, all Performance Analytics data are available through the standard ServiceNow interfaces instead of needing a separate app.</p><p></p><p>And the usability of the app has been improved, as well.   Easily switch between indicators and breakdowns on a single page instead of having to navigate through many different levels.   See better visualizations of the data through more prominent displays of important data and more eye-pleasing charts.</p><p></p><p>Working with data is easier and more accessible while still being secure.</p><p><img   alt="mobile.png" class="image-5 jive-image" src="58e355cadbd89f048c8ef4621f96196e.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 265px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>And There's More!!!</h2><p></p><p>This is just scratching the tip of the iceberg of the things that are available to you in reporting and Performance Analytics on Helsinki.   In the coming weeks, we will add more blog posts that go into detail on all of these topics and more!   Keep coming back to this page, as I will link my colleagues' articles to this main one as they get written.</p><p></p><p>Also post questions as you have them.   I will be monitoring this article and will reply as soon as I can.</p><p><br/>Enjoy the trip to Helsinki!!!</p>
