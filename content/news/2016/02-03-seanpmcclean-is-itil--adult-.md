Process is for anyone. Except for children under 3. Don't teach ITIL to 3 year olds. It's too naughty for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">This is finally the part where the crazy <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/blogs/blog/2011/08/08/1373">goose-guy</a> goes too far.   He's somehow going to turn ITIL into Por-</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">C'mon! Seriously? You didn't think I was going to go </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-style: italic;">there,</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> did you?   If you had any thoughts that I might, then turn your browser elsewhere.</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Here's the thing; people think <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/blogs/blog/2011/12/07/1380">ITIL </a>is for Mature Audiences Only. Or maybe IT Geeks Only (rated: ITGO?).   But understanding how interest works isn't just for finance geeks, and understanding the process and protocol for meetings or appropriate language in the workplace isn't just for human resource geeks.   Knowing at least the basics of how "IT gets done" is a good idea for everyone.</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Fundamentally, ITIL is a library of processes for Information Technology (IT).   And if you are using any technology more advanced than a pencil, perhaps you should know some of those fundamentals.   Even a pencil could be considered a piece of Information Technology, and believe it or not, there's process(es) for managing it - from keeping the pointy end down, to how you'll maintain or fix if broken, and even how to get (or order) the best ones for the job (I like the ones with the funny erasers at the end).   </span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Process is something just about any audience can handle - and should be familiar with, because let's face it, if you tell your boss you can't do your work because you don't know how to fix/replace/manage the pencil, there's gonna be problems.</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Seriously.   Information Technologies (IT) are really (typically) just tools, be it a pencil or a program.   So doesn't it make some sense that those tools would be managed through processes as well?   </span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">And if you're going to manage them, wouldn't it make sense to manage them using a platform that can also manage other processes (ranging from Human Resources, to Finance, to Projects and beyond)?   A platform like ServiceNow that can support consistent processes, but also be flexible enough to "step around" process when the customer needs service, rather than rule-stamped rigidity ('sorry, we only can do this one way…').</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Hmm - that's something I'll have to check out in my next post…(spoiler, it'll probably be about pencils…)</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Stay tuned for more (MATURE) information from… The <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/blogs/blog/2011/08/08/1373">GooseGuy.</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #eb7a3d;">Please Rate, Share, and Comment!</span></p><p dir="ltr"></p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">Click to Find More <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/blogs/content?filterID=contentstatus[published]~category[thought-leadership]">Blog</a> and <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=d6295a2ddbd897c068c1fb651f9619f1">Expert Events</a><br/></span></p><hr/>
