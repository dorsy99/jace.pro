During this integration we also learnt how to run command shell command, batch file and powershell command without using orchestration feature.</p><p><br/>All MIDserver communication from SNOW happens using ECC queue hence it was clear to us that we have to use ECC queue to run the powershell command.</p><p><br/><a title="morphis.com/blogs/orchestration-commands-mid-server/#comment-40" href="http://inmorphis.com/blogs/orchestration-commands-mid-server/#comment-40">(Read More)</a></p>
