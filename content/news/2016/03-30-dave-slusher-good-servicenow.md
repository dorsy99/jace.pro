<p>I wanted to point to an external blog (off the community) run by the consultants at <a title="w.servicenowprotips.com/contact-us/" href="http://www.servicenowprotips.com/contact-us/">The ServiceNow Guys</a>. Their blog <a title="w.servicenowprotips.com/" href="http://www.servicenowprotips.com/">ServiceNow Pro Tips</a> has a lot of good resources and is worth a look periodically to pick up new tips and tricks.</p><p></p><p>In particular, the posts on Â  What's New in Geneva <a title="w.servicenowprotips.com/blog/2016/1/7/servicenow-geneva-pro-tips-whats-new-in-geneva" href="http://www.servicenowprotips.com/blog/2016/1/7/servicenow-geneva-pro-tips-whats-new-in-geneva">Part 1 </a>and <a title="w.servicenowprotips.com/blog/2016/3/11/servicenow-geneva-ui" href="http://www.servicenowprotips.com/blog/2016/3/11/servicenow-geneva-ui">Part 2</a> are insightful and deserve a read, as is this one discussing the use of <a title="w.servicenowprotips.com/blog/2016/2/6/gliderecord-client-side-vs-server-side" href="http://www.servicenowprotips.com/blog/2016/2/6/gliderecord-client-side-vs-server-side">GlideRecord and how it differs from the Client Side vs the Server Side</a>.</p><p></p><p>I'll be following the blog and looking for interesting posts to highlight here. If you run across other resources that you find valuable, let me know via a comment on this post and I will add them to a daily ritual of reading the ServiceNow blogosphere. </p>
