<p>A number of customers and partners have already started to take advantage of our ServiceNow Learning Library. Now this isn't your average "library" of on-demand technical training content. We have been able to create our own platform to deliver these courses to provide you with a "Netflix" type environment for your training needs.</p><p></p><p>You might be interested in our 1-day (8-hour) Event Management course or our 8-hour Performance Analytics for Managers course. As stand-alone offerings, we would likely have to charge our daily rate around $1k PER COURSE. In this unique format, we are providing access to ALL of our on-demand content for a single $1k/user/year subscription fee. We believe this way, you can access more than just one type of course and content and we can provide it to you as quickly as we can produce it without having to go through all the hassle of listing individual courses.</p><p></p><p>This month we have added a few more smaller recordings to our portfolio and I will be sharing some new offerings that we have planned in my post next week.
