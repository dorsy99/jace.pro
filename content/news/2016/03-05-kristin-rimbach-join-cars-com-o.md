They saw a great opportunity to change the way work gets done, not only inside IT but also for various departments. See how they are driving to new destinations:   <br/> <br/>First Stop: IT <br/>Cars.com helps more than 31 million online visitors decide which vehicle to buy, where to buy it, and how much to pay. As their customer base expanded, they knew their IT infrastructure had to keep up. They were relying on a repository of spreadsheets to manage processes- version control was impossible and workflows were inconsistent. With ServiceNow, a single system of record provides visibility and control, saving the service desk <strong>thousands</strong> of hours per year.<br/> </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: #535353; font-size: 12pt;">Second Stop: Facilities</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: #535353; font-size: 12pt;">Facilities engineers at Cars.com are constantly on the move. When requests came in, it would often be hours until someone returned to their desk to see it. By enabling a mobile solution, engineers can quickly respond wherever they are. By leveraging ServiceNow, engineers now resolve 60% more tickets per month.   <br/> <br/></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: #535353; font-size: 12pt;">Third Stop: HR <br/>With rapid company growth comes an influx of new employees. Each new employee requires a telephone, computer, security credentials, email account, and more. Previously, the coordination between IT and HR was completed via back and forth emails and paper forms. Today, IT provisioning and approvals are automatically kicked off once someone is hired. By automating 80% of the process, HR has regained 300 hours per year. <br/> </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: #535353; font-size: 12pt;">Where to Next?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: #535353; font-size: 12pt;">Budget planning, planning operations, and a documentation library are all on the roadmap at Cars.com.
