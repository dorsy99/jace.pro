Go ahead and clone the <a title="ithub.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs" href="https://github.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs">Node.js myworkapp</a>, give it a try and let us know what you think. We're looking forward to hearing what you think and seeing what you build.</p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">The <a title="ithub.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs" href="https://github.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs">Node.js myworkapp</a> example app can be found on GitHub under the <a title="ithub.com/ServiceNow" href="https://github.com/ServiceNow">ServiceNow organization</a>. Look for "example-restclient" in the name and you'll see that there are currently repos for the <a title="ithub.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs" href="https://github.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs">myworkapp-nodejs</a> and <a title="ithub.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-ios" href="https://github.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-ios">myworkapp-ios</a> projects. The myworkapp-nodejs is ready for you to take a look at today and in the next few weeks we'll have the myworkapp-ios example ready. These are the first two example apps in a series we have planned so stay tuned you'll soon hear about more example apps we are working on.</p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><strong>tl;dr</strong></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">Each of the example client applications follow the pattern of providing a client application in a different format/language that relies on the same ServiceNow platform REST API and Scripted REST API for their backend. In this way each example app provides a client in a different format/language but all of them user HTTPS to communicate with a ServiceNow instance. For those of you familiar with the <a title="domvc.com/" href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a> you may see the similarity here.</p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">The custom Task Tracker Scripted REST API (included in the repo and available on share) acts as a simple <a title="croservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html" href="http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API Gateway</a> providing a REST API that gathers data from various underlying apps/tables in the ServiceNow instance and returns a list of all tasks that are active and assigned to the requestor (based on credentials included in the request). The platform REST Table API is then being used to gather comments for each task and to lookup details about the requesting user. We are using the REST Table API to illustrate that the client application could use multiple APIs to gather data but we could have also chosen to implement all of the functionality in the Task Tracker Scripted REST API.</p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><strong>More about ServiceNow REST APIs</strong></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">ServiceNow provides REST APIs that allow developers to connect their applications to ServiceNow using protocols (HTTPS) and data formats (JSON/XML) that they expect and are familiar with. In addition to providing platform REST APIs that support CRUD operations on any data table in the platform developers also have the ability to create their own REST APIs (using ServiceNow Scripted REST APIs) that provide custom interfaces for their applications and data.</p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">The ability for developers to create custom REST APIs is a recent addition and was introduced in the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/release_notes/geneva-release-notes.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/release_notes/geneva-release-notes.html">ServiceNow Geneva release</a> as <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/integrate/custom_web_services/concept/c_CustomWebServices.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/integrate/custom_web_services/concept/c_CustomWebServices.html">Scripted REST APIs</a>. Scripted REST APIs meet customers need to be able to create a custom interface for a variety of reasons including; to integrate with a 3rd party service that didn't allow flexibility in the format of the request payloads it sent to ServiceNow (e.g., WebHooks, IoT Sensor Posts), to provide an API Gateway style interface for interacting with their applications and data in ServiceNow, to return custom payloads to their WebApps or UI Pages using modern frameworks like AngularJS or KnockoutJS, to provide custom interfaces to meet their customers needs.</p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">You can find out more about ServiceNow, ServiceNow REST APIs, and our developer program via the following links:</p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><a title="eveloper.servicenow.com/app.do#!/home" href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/home">ServiceNow Developer Program</a></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><a title="t.ly/snrestapi" href="http://bit.ly/snrestapi">ServiceNow REST API Reference</a></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/integrate/custom_web_services/concept/c_CustomWebServices.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/integrate/custom_web_services/concept/c_CustomWebServices.html">Scripted REST APIs Reference</a></p><p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=ec1daea5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961928">Blog Post: Introducing Scripted REST APIs</a></p>
