<p><span style="font-family: 'arial black', 'avant garde'; font-size: 14pt;">*** Notes from Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit EMEA 2016 ***</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img   alt="Gartner_City.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="402" src="d845c1c2db9897041dcaf3231f961975.iix" style="float: right; height: 403px; width: 663.233183856502px;" width="663"/></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As more machines go online — from fitbits to cars to pretty much everything with a battery — many parts of life are linked to the digital world and we generate more and more data. The sheer amount of data makes it hard to detect and deal with security threats.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">But we really like digital. It's easier, faster, better connected and just more fun than undigital. We like it at home, as part of our social lives, and we like it in our work environment.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">And data, data we like too, because we can hold on to it and look back to analyse it; it teaches us about our behavior — so that we can change things for the better.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You count your steps for a week and the graph shows you exactly why you're too heavy. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sitting where I am — in the seating area at <a title="w.gartner.com/events/emea/security" href="http://www.gartner.com/events/emea/security">Gartner's Security &amp; Risk Management Summit</a> in The InterContinental O2, London — the view is actually quite stunning. Across the river Thames, there is the London City, with some of our largest customers right in the middle. Banks, insurers, other large financial institutions, as well as the consultancies helping them survive and get ahead in a fast-changing world. The stakes are high.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Customers expect digital service. Shareholders expect operational costs to go down. Governments expect for the rules to be followed. Employees expect great internal service systems and processes. The business expects it all to be mobile and just working. The board expects digital transformation <em>and</em> the highest grade of information security in the world. <em>All of this at the same time</em>, because the competition is brutal.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Lots of expectations for the Chief Information Security Officer to meet. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Counting ones steps for a week is one thing. Counting all cyber threats hitting a large private cloud deployment for a week is another. Understanding which threats are real and potentially dangerous, detecting them, activating the right defensive systems to counter them, pulling teams together to work on remediating the risks associated, firming up the firewalls, redesigning automated response processes, updating managements and business owners and so forth is a daunting task.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is the stuff CISO's are concerned with. Luckily, there's a system for most of this, some cutting edge piece of software to detect threats. Some other product to assess the probability of a threat to breach the firewall, a way to calculate business impact, some other solution to suggest remediation, some other… well you see where this is going. And it's hard to get a clear overview of the overall security posture if this is how things are being managed. And all too often, this is exactly how security operations are set up. The security team is a fire brigade.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">That's the thing with data. There's just way too much of it. Once you have figured out what to respond to, there's little time left for the fire brigade to take action.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is how ServiceNow stands out here at <a title="w.gartner.com/events/emea/security" href="http://www.gartner.com/events/emea/security">Gartner's Security &amp; Risk Management Summit</a>: our platform isn't a point product — it's a way to bring all data and intelligence together to automatically orchestrate the most relevant response to security incidents. It turns the security team into an integral part of the IT organisation — to work with 24/7, not only when the house is on fire and you need a hose.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The ServiceNow platform can be the single system of record and engagement to consolidate data and triggers from multiple other systems, standardize and automate workflows for response and remediation, provide dashboards to visualize the overall security status of the infrastructure to different levels of the business. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Come meet us at the InterContinental O2. Myke Lyons is speaking tomorrow at 11.30am local time.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Can't make it?
