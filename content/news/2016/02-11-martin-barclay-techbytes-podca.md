ServiceNow admins can manage the entire mobile device and application lifecycle from within ServiceNow and the MobiChord app.</p><p></p><p>In the podcast, Herbert talks about three customers that have implemented MobiChord and realized OPEX savings not only in mobile operator service charges but also in administrative overhead costs. The customer is able to shift cost to value by reducing the number of people needed to perform routine daily tasks by automating workflows and mobile device management. Those same employees that were formerly manually tracking and maintaining mobile devices and apps are now performing customer-facing work that adds value to the business.</p><p></p><p>One of the more powerful capabilities of the MobiChord app is to enable enterprises to see what other companies in their industry are paying for mobile voice and data, and compare that to what they are currently paying. This gives IT and finance visibility into the information they need to successfully negotiate with mobile operators to cut their bills, In one customer case that Herbert describes the customer was able to realize a savings of $1M per year in operating costs, which adds   directly to their bottom line. Think of this as the <a title="w.truecar.com/" href="http://www.truecar.com/">TrueCar</a> of mobile expense management.</p><p></p><p>MobiChord also provides a single admin portal into multiple mobile network operators, meaning admins don't have to learn or follow different workflows or processes to do business with the various mobile operators they use across the globe - in many cases ten or more. Ordering a device from Verizon is the same as   Telstra is the same as Orange.   This significantly increases the efficiency and productivity of IT admins responsible for mobile device management.</p><p></p><p>See for yourself: Customers can take MobiChord for a free 30-day test drive <a title="t.ly/1o36HCa" href="http://bit.ly/1o36HCa">at the ServiceNow Store.</a></p>
