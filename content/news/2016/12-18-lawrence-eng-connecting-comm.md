<p>We have continued to evolve the functionality on HI to make it easier for you to post questions from HI to the Community. Some of the changes we made in early March 2017 are highlighted below. In the first 3 months of 2017, we have seen 267 people across 22 countries use this feature, and we've gotten great feedback so far, and we'd love to hear what you think as well.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="image001.png" border="1" class="image-5 jive-image" src="a5c7854adb541b04ed6af3231f9619d0.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;"/></p><p></p><h1>3 ways you will get community content in HI</h1><p>If you have logged into HI recently and visited the <strong>Get Help</strong> page, you may have noticed some of the things we changed and added.</p><p></p><h3>1. See relevant community content</h3><h3></h3><h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Improved community search results</span></h3><p>Whether you are searching from the HI Service Portal homepage or seeing related search results when opening an incident, the community content that is surfaced will be better than before. Specifically, the results no longer contain questions that haven't received a response yet.<span style="color: #eb7a3d;"> </span></p><p></p><h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Recommended community content</span></h3><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We've added community content boxes (containing question threads and blog posts) to the <strong>Get Help</strong> page. The community has a ton of content; based on issues you've reported, we're working hard to make sure the community content we display is actually useful to you. We are also recommending SNUGs in your area that you can join if you haven't already, and pointing out upcoming events you might want to attend:</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="image002.png" class="image-8 jive-image" src="9effd806db9057041dcaf3231f96192c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 317px;"/></p><p></p><h3>2. Ask your questions to the community without leaving HI</h3><p></p><p>You can now post your questions to the community directly from HI. This features is more likely to get you a faster response and benefits the community as a whole. Since solutions will be publicly available, your discussion can help future users with the same question. Whether you want to ask the community or ServiceNow Customer Support is up to you:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="image003.png" class="image-9 jive-image" src="407f33b1db185fc03eb27a9e0f9619af.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p><strong>*Pro-Tip*:</strong> If you link your HI and ServiceNow Community accounts, you won't need to enter them every time you want to post a question:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="verify.png" class="image-11 jive-image" src="e1018942dbd01b04ed6af3231f9619e8.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 442px;"/></p><p></p><h3>3. Look for the "Community Posts" tab under "My Issues"</h3><p></p><p>From HI, you can also access a list of all the questions you've posted to the community. Look for the "Community" tab under "My Issues".</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="my-issues.png" class="image-10 jive-image" src="c4e625c6db5cd304b322f4621f9619eb.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 334px;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p>We hope these changes will encourage you to take advantage of the collective experience and deep knowledge of the ServiceNow user community. Every time you use the community to get your questions answered, you are potentially helping scores of other ServiceNow users, which makes us all better!</p>
