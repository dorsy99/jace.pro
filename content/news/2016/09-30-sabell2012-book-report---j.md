So, finally, here it is!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Frankly speaking, I consider this particular book to be the "Gold Standard" of the JavaScript language!   Gush!   Gush!   :-)   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">First, let me do a bit of explanation.   Douglas Crockford is a major contributor to the JavaScript language.   He is credited with popularizing the JSON format.   And he wrote this book.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">So, for me, this made me interested in what the book had to say.   I mean, the guy who helped define the language ought to know what he is talking about, right?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I ordered my copy online and didn't pay too much attention as to content (it was recommended by a friend that I get a copy).   When it showed up and I took it out of the shipping box...I was surprised.   What-the-heck!   It was only about 5/8" of an inch thick!   My first thought:   I've been ripped off!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Well, I am glad to say, that particular thought vaporized the minute I opened the book.   Inside was a clean, concise, well written (yes, even entertaining) book on the JavaScript language.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Pretty much every important aspect of the language is covered, and examples (code-snippets) are provided.   Geez, examples, and good ones!</span></p><p></p><p><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">So what's in the book?</strong></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Crockford breaks out the language into seven general topics, and then drills down on each with detail on specific "good" features.   Yes, there are ten chapters; see my description of each and you will understand.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 1 - Introduction.   Here the author explains why and when you would use JavaScript, and a bit of history on its development.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 2 - Grammar.   You can't have a language without the basics.   Here you will find names, numbers, strings and all that.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 3 - Objects.   One of my favorite chapters.   This is one of the core power-tools of JavaScript.   Crockford does an outstanding job of going over object definitions, referencing, and much more.   His explanation of prototypes is excellent.   There are lots of examples here.   The author also covers some interesting little-discussed features such as: Delete and Global Abatement.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 4 - Functions!   Another of the core power-tools of JavaScript.   Here the author describes these in detail; covering most of the features you will probably ever need to use in your day-to-day development job.   Function Objects, literals, arguments, <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">recursion</strong> (I bold this because it is a super topic to learn, and I know many a programmer that shies away from the topic),   callbacks, and a LOT more.   There are excellent examples of every aspect that is presented.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 5 - Inheritance.   In my previous book report (<a title="Book Report - Principles of Object Oriented JavaScript" __default_attr="4746" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Book Report - Principles of Object Oriented JavaScript" data-renderedposition="1175.2698974609375_384.1761169433594_404_18" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=c99daa69dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619ca">Book Report - Principles of Object Oriented JavaScript</a> ) I covered a book that treated this and other Object Oriented (OO) features of the JavaScript language.   JavaScript is not an OO language, but it does have a couple of OO features.   One of these is inheritance.   Here Crockford covers how to model inheritance using the built-in features: Prototypes, and Functions.   Do you see a progression here by the author?   Each chapter builds off the next.   Nicely done.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 6 - Arrays.   One of my favorite topics to write about.   This chapter you will want to read through a couple of times.   He covers all the typical language definitions: literals, length, enumeration, dimensions.   However, the author doesn't stop there but includes: deletion of array elements, methods, and an interesting section on confusion.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 7 - Regular Expressions.   This chapter is not a tutorial on regular expressions, but instead covers how to use regular expressions in JavaScript.   Several nice examples!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 8 - Methods.   This is a really great chapter!   Honest!   Here you find most of the super useful built-in functions of JavaScript described WITH examples!   Some of them pretty in-depth.   Gold!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 9 - Style. Here the author touches briefly on coding standards, and how to avoid the most common errors associated with things like formatting.   Indentation and readability can really be a problem in any language.   Of all the chapters I felt that this one probably should have been expanded further to include more examples, and pitfalls.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Chapter 10 - Beautiful Features.   A short wrap-up chapter where the author describes his thoughts on JavaScript, and a direction he adopted to employ more advanced features.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Despite the title, Crockford put in a couple of </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">appendices</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> on the warts: The awful (his wording), and the bad parts of the language. These should have been combined to form a chapter on what NOT to do!   I highly recommend memorizing these, and employing them in your standards as things to avoid.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The awful:   This should have been titled: The Ugly, but he might have run afoul of some movie rights.   Covered:   GLOBAL VARIABLES (my feeling is that this should go in the bad features), scope (I don't know how many times I have been bit by this), the overloaded plus feature ( + ), floating point, NaN, and many more.   Some example, but frankly he does fine with his descriptions.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The bad: interestingly Crockford mentions ==, and != as evil.   :-)   After reading his description and reasoning I would have to say I agree.   Also: eval, continue, switch fall-through (I love/hate this feature of switch).   ++, --, bitwise operations, and a bunch more.   With examples.   Nasty stuff.   Bet you use some of it in your code!   :-)</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Crockford also throws in a couple of appendices covering JSLint (which he created); a super-great JavaScript testing tool, and JSON (which he popularized heavily).   Of course both topics are well covered, and have examples.   Crockford even throws in a complete JSON parser written in JavaScript!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">For those of you who are into computer language design, Crockford has even provided a serious break-out of syntax diagrams throughout the book, and in an appendix.   This is a great example of a computer language definition.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">So here is how much of a nerd I am: I read this thing twice through after receiving my copy, and it sits dog-eared on my desk for quick referencing (yeah, I use it even above w3schools).</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">BTW, it has a terrific index making it really easy to look things up (don't worry you will have it all memorized after reading it through a couple of times anyway...right?!).</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">It is amazing how much material is packed into such a thin tome.   <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">For those of you wanting to take your scripting skills to the next level this is a must have.   </span>I highly recommend you purchase a copy of this really useful book!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Steven Bell</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">P.S.   If you get the chance, go to anyplace in ServiceNow where the Script Editor is present (Fix Scripts is a good place) and type in the following:</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">eval('gs.print("Hello World")');</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Note the syntax warning that is presented.   Then look on p.122 of the book.   Yep, that is where it comes from!   :-)</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">P.P.S.   Also, you might want to search the Script Includes and see how many times eval is used!   It is a very interesting exercise!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">P.P.P.S.   I agree with the author on eval to a point.   It is a highly useful feature and has analogs in other languages.   It is a necessary feature in most.   He does caveat it.   He places eval in the good parts core of the book, and in the bad parts appendices (for good reasons).</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><img   class="jive-image" src="9422184adbd01f048c8ef4621f9619a8.iix"/></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: inherit; font-family: Arial;">For a list of all of my articles:   </span><a _jive_internal="true" href="/groups/servicenow-user-group-us-tx-north-texas/blog/2015/10/23/community-code-snippets-articles-list-to-date" style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #266fc8;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: inherit; font-family: Arial;">Community Code Snippets: Articles List to Date</span></a></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #eb7a3d;">Please Share, Like, Bookmark, Mark Helpful, or Comment this blog if you've found it helpful or insightful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #eb7a3d;">Also, if you are not already, I would like to encourage you to become a member of our blog!</span></p>
