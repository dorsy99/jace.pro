This could be something that you haven't had time or cycles to address in your day-day work life, or something super cool and high value that you've always wanted to try but never had the time or resources. The hackathon is the perfect opportunity for you to take a crack at it, with the very latest ServiceNow Platform release and tools, plus ServiceNow gurus to speed you along your way. Some examples to get you thinking:</p><p></p><ul><li>A broken process that is causing wasted time, user frustration, and unnecessary complexity</li><li>A legacy app with a poor UX that is difficult to maintain</li><li>A workflow that takes multiple apps and manual steps to complete</li><li>Big, hairy, audacious app requests sitting in the backlog</li><li>Repetitive tasks involving external systems and processes that take up more time than they should, that if automated would save big bucks, people time, and reduce errors</li><li>Management reports involving enterprise assets, CMDB, and service records that require multiple data sources and reporting systems to get the necessary information and are slow, cumbersome and error-prone to pull together</li><li>Any service (request-action-result)   in any department in your company that is unstructured and uses email, spreadsheets, Word docs, IM, and phone calls to get done that could be improved via process re-architecting, automation, and a consumer-grade UX.</li><li>Crazy things most people would never think about - standing up new physical storefronts; running a smart city, neighborhood, or building. You get the idea.</li></ul><p></p><p>Since we're not in the business of capping or limiting your innovation, "work" could be either at your current workplace or any place of work/business where you could envision ServiceNow being of value. Let's drill down a bit on the categories:</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Platform Vanguard</span>: Best use of new Platform features and tools in Helsinki - think Service Portal, ECMAScript/JavaScript 5, Git integration. Excel XLSX support, native Android app, Delegated Development.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Business Solution</span>: An app that delivers the highest tangible/measurable ROI in terms of i)   increasing revenue, productivity, efficiency, business agility, user satisfaction (NPS) or ii)     reducing cost or risk. Think about pitching your app to the CFO or COO.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most Innovative</span>: This is an open category. The only requirement is that it be of high value to some kind of business (any business, not necessarily your current place of work).   Unleash your creativity about what can be done with the ServiceNow Platform.</p><p></p><p><strong>Registration Instructions</strong></p><p></p><p>To get in on the action, follow these three steps in sequence:</p><p></p><p>1) <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/register-pricing.html" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/register-pricing.html">Register </a>for K16 or CreatorCon</p><p>2) Add the CreatorCon Hackathon Session Type to your K16 agenda using the Session Scheduler on the <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/">K16 website</a>.</p><p>3) Within 24 hours of doing 2), we will send an email to the email address you used in 1) with further instructions to officially register for the Hackathon, start or join a team, and preparing to compete!</p><p></p><p>Slay your (or any) business problem in 8 hours with your innovation on top of the ServiceNow Platform and be a hero when you get back to work.</p><p></p><p>#HackNow Team</p>
