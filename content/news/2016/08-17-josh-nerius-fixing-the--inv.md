We recently noticed that a number of developers have been running into an odd dictionary issue. This issue could occur in any app, but I'll focus on fixing it in the <strong>Marketing Events</strong> application we build as part of the <a title="t.ly/2bliQMK" href="http://bit.ly/2bliQMK">Building a sample ServiceNow application</a> course. </p><p></p><h1><strong>The Problem<br/></strong></h1><p></p><p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Helsinki</p><p></p><p><strong>If we:</strong></p><p></p><ol><li>Create a table that extends <strong>task</strong></li><li>Change our minds and delete the table we just created</li><li>Change our minds again and create a table with the same name</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>This happens: </strong></p><p></p><p><img   alt="blog_aug15_img1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="373" src="71ab8502db54130468c1fb651f9619fb.iix" style="width: 903px; height: 372.815px;" width="903"/></p><p></p><p>For the benefit of search engines: </p><p></p><p><strong>Error 1</strong>: Invalid 'Table' selected on the Module record.
