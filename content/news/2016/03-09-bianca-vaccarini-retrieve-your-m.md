<p>Monitoring and identifying the time in which your team handles an incident, problem, or record is important to understand the circumstances and logic of activity. By default, the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/administer/form_administration/concept/c_ActivityFormatter.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/administer/form_administration/concept/c_ActivityFormatter.html">activity formatter</a> is enabled on the Task [task] table and tables extended off the Task table, such as the Incident [incident] table. Starting in Geneva and UI16, the activity formatter shows updates in real time so you can see the latest information without refreshing the form. User presence enables you to see when other users are entering comments.</p><p></p><p>For users on select Fuji releases, you may notice that your <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551167" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551167">activity log no longer shows the date and time</a> in which the activity happened. You will notice the missing activity entries if you try to expand the activity details or if you attempt to open it in a new tab. This can lead to confusion among your team as they are not sure how long it has been in between responses and activity on a record. Here's the kicker, if you reload the form, make an update to the record, or expand and refresh, the activity date and time stamps come back. This leads users to think that the missing activity entries were just a fluke, only to experience it again later down the road.</p><p><img   alt="Activity expanded missing date time stamp (2).jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="36653482db989344e9737a9e0f961987.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 620px; height: 279px;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;"><em>Note:   the activities are no longer just collapsed but entirely hidden and shouldn't be.</em></span></p><p></p><p>Good news is that if you are upgrading to Fuji Patch 7 Hot fix 6, Fuji Patch 8, or Geneva, your activity entries are retrieved (or preserved depending on what release you are coming from).</p><p></p><h3>There are two ways to resolve this issue and retrieve your activity time stamps:</h3><ul><li>Upgrade</li><li>Create an onLoad global Client Script</li></ul><p></p><p>If it is on your roadmap, you can skip the workaround and have this problem resolved in Fuji Patch 7 Hot fix 6, Fuji Patch 8, and Geneva. But, if upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can use the following onLoad global Client Script to reload the missing headers after they are hidden. The client script must be wrapped within "addLateLoadEvent" to execute after the rest of the base system scripts.</p><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_macro_code _jivemacro_uid_14573908067164563 jive_text_macro" data-renderedposition="1452.9970703125_7.997159004211426_284_108" jivemacro_uid="_14573908067164563"><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'courier new', courier;">function onLoad() {</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'courier new', courier;">   addLateLoadEvent(function() {</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'courier new', courier;">       jQuery("div.activity_header").show();</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'courier new', courier;">   });</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'courier new', courier;">}</span></p></pre><p></p><p>For more information on this Known Error in Fuji, see <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551167" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551167">After reloading or saving a record, the Activity Filter does not render Activity entries (such as the date/time stamp) when expanding</a>.
