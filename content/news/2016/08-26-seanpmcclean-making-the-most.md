<p dir="ltr"><span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">A few months ago I wrote a series on LinkedIn about an observation - that training is a service, like pizza delivery (you can those articles </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/am-i-instructor-just-glorified-pizza-boy-scary-question-sean-mcclean?trk=prof-post"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-teach-like-pizza-boy-pt2-providing-learning-service-sean-mcclean?trk=prof-post"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">) - but that sometimes, both the delivery people (trainers) and delivery recipients (students / participants) maybe weren't handling that service super well.   As a final installment, I thought I'd put some thought to how to really use training. So let's start with </span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">scissors</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">.</span></span></span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">There are some award winning, amazing scissors out there - they cost a fortune. Diamond laser-tuned blades, ergonomics designed by artificial intelligence ...so cool!!!   But they are specifically for hair cutting.   </span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">I'm sure barbers and hair professionals weep to see me using a pair to cut up old boxes, my daughters science projects, and sometimes as a screwdriver or pry bar…</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"><img alt="pizza3.jpg" class="jive-image" height="254" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mzq88wdf0w5Kfo23fCBAlZq_Ernt1r5_7Toa1LQU79aiCRC4AMf0NIXKKB5XPAapx3OJrwAb-JHkDK2uxD1eo5Tgt16gNtANiIsTszU5xc15IWKmlIF1c9vHgo9ZSHVAqiiOEcQM" style="border-style: none;" width="381"/></span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Now, most of us in this community are Knowledge Workers, which in turn means that we are </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Learning Professionals</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">.   And that means one of the most crucial tools we have is training, and sometimes I weep to see you misusing it.   Doesn't it just make sense to learn the best way to use the most important and fundamental tool in our arsenal for learning?</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> Training classes have some characteristics that can make them powerful:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> - fixed duration (a beginning and end)</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> - (somewhat) fixed content (based on objectives, audience, etc)</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> - scaled delivery (multiple people getting the same fundamental information)</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Now, it's probably no surprise we have </span><a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification.html"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">amazing</span></a><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">, award </span><a href="http://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-education-services-wins-cedma-impact-award.html"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">winning</span></a><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">, impactful, multi-modal and certifiable </span><a href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/datasheets/ds-servicenow-quick-reference-guide-and-pricing.pdf"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">training</span></a><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">.   Our classes (and trainers, and curriculum designers) can deliver   a broad content of objectives to a large number of people in a fixed timeframe.   AND this is GOOD!!!!   Highly tuned, just like those scissors. </span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">But I wouldn't use scissors to fix a flat tire.   And a (single) training class is not necessarily the best tool for:</span></p><ul><li><span dir="ltr">Very specific, unique, extensive individualized use cases (think <a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/implementation-services.html"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">consulting</span></a>)</span></li><li><span dir="ltr">Perpetual ongoing learning and deeper research (think <a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Main_Page"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">the wiki</span></a>, <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">the doc</span></a>, but also the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/servicenow-techbytes/id1038560176?mt=2"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">podcasts</span></a> - you know we have podcasts right?, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo/videos"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">videos</span></a>? And, perhaps most important, a <a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/learning-library.html"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">learning library</span></a> for self directed, ongoing learning?) </span></li><li><span dir="ltr">Completely uncharted invention and innovation (think collaboration through our <a _jive_internal="true" href="/welcome"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">Community</span></a>, <a _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=1e295a2ddbd897c068c1fb651f9619ca"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">Physical Meetups</span></a>, Hackathons and more)</span></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">This does NOT mean a class should be "nothing but the book" with no discussions, questions, or experimentation.   Educators and pedagogues jump up and down about these. Our trainers each bring their own experiences, stories, examples, and outside expertise with every class, and our classes have pioneered some of the most innovative ways to inspire collaboration and participation.   It DOES mean that trying to wring things from a class that are far outside the objectives is liable to be a less good use of your time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">If I asked the pizza delivery person (PizzaProfessional?) to help me make italian wedding soup - because you know, pizza and wedding soup are both itallian, you'd think I was nuts - and I'd be in worse trouble if they actually tried.   It's a horrible use of a good resource.</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">However - if I asked my PizzaPro about any other dish she's delivered - how're those garlic knots?   The wings any good? Or the quickest way to just about any local neighborhood or place - she's got the inside track.</span></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p><span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">AND that's</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> how you can best use your class (and trainer).   In Addition to the specific content, tested examples, real world experiences and crafted opportunities for collaboration (instead of just banging your heads together on your own), your trainer has studied and researched and networked.   They are the </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">expert</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> in the resources, and beyond the class stuff, they can help you find the best options for </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ongoing learning</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> - and they are developing other learning tools like a proverbial smorgasbord - a </span><a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/learning-library.html"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">Library of ongoing training</span></a><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> that they can help you navigate for your </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">individual </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">needs and interests.</span></span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">They probably know the fastest "route" through the documentation, the best (hottest) videos and classes and sub-communities - and they can show you how to get to them faster.</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Getting a theme here? You see, the training course is just one tool - but like the bottom rung on a ladder it's a tool that should be able to help you better reach </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">all of the</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> other tools more effectively.   And if a trainer (or class) is providing a good service, they will help steer you toward these other resources to extend your learning.</span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">So, next time, get the most of your pizza pro by asking them for the hot tips about routes, traffic, and good food.   And use your trainer for extra value by maybe having them steer you towards the best resources for your <em>ongoing learning.</em></span></p>
