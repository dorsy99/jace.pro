Phishing emails are a daily annoyance, but they're also a popular ingress point for targeted attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Overall, phishing and spam messages are on the decline, but that's simply because attacks are becoming more targeted. Spear-phishing campaigns targeting employees increased 55% last year, according to Symantec's Internet Security Threat Report, and these campaigns are more selective than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">It's become easy and inexpensive to launch a spear phishing campaign thanks to readily available kits. But what makes these attacks successful is targeting and personalization through social engineering.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="background-position: initial; font-weight: bold;">We are the Weakest Link</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Humans continue to be the <a title="w.forbes.com/sites/steveculp/2016/05/10/cyber-risk-people-are-often-the-weakest-link-in-the-security-chain/#660a978c14b5" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveculp/2016/05/10/cyber-risk-people-are-often-the-weakest-link-in-the-security-chain/#660a978c14b5" rel="noopener nofollow" style="background-position: initial; color: #8c68cb;" target="_blank">weakest link</a> in the infosec chain, and with tons of information available about companies and their employees on the Internet, it doesn't take much effort for these emails to look convincing. In fact, it can be as simple as sending what looks like an attached invoice to accounts payable.   </p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">The <a title="w.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/russian-hackers-faked-gmail-password-form-to-invade-dnc-emai" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/russian-hackers-faked-gmail-password-form-to-invade-dnc-emai" rel="noopener nofollow" style="background-position: initial; color: #8c68cb;" target="_blank">now-infamous hack</a> of the Democratic National Committee exploited this human vulnerability. Staffers received what looked like a Gmail password reset message, and the link took them to what appeared to be a Google login page, where their passwords were collected. Twenty out of 108 recipients clicked this link, giving hackers access to email, schedules, and shared documents.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Many organizations roll out security training to attempt to prevent this kind of breach, users are becoming smarter but they need to be acknowledged when they report attempts. So… how do you deal with phishing emails?</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="background-position: initial; font-weight: bold;">Black Hole Mailbox</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Do you have a reporting email address like <a title="ilto:phishing@acmecorp.com/" href="http://mailto:phishing@acmecorp.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" style="background-position: initial; color: #8c68cb;" target="_blank">phishing@acmecorp.com</a>? Is it simply a mailbox or does it go to a distribution list? Is there some type of auto-reply enabled? Have I now proprogated the threat? The bigger question is: does anyone pay attention to it?</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">There are often so many other higher priority issues to deal with that the phishing mailbox gets largely ignored. When these reports go to a distribution list, they're even more likely to be ignored as everyone assumes someone else will do it. Email is not a system of record and therefore shouldn't be used to track phishing attacks. Not to mention that there's no way to implement repeatability, correlate and generate threat intelligence, or development or access to shared knowledge.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">On the submitters' side, they have no idea if anyone even received the email, let alone did anything about it. They don't get any feedback as to whether what they submitted was actually a phishing email or if they did the right thing by submitting it. Recognition is an important part of promoting security conscience behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="background-position: initial; font-weight: bold;">Phishing Response the Automated Way</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">In my <a title="mmunity.servicenow.com/community/security-operations/blog/2016/10/14/security-automation-that-won-t-get-you-fired" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=95ada2a9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961915" rel="noopener nofollow" style="background-position: initial; color: #8c68cb;" target="_blank">last post</a>, I wrote how automation can save you some 20 minutes of investigation for every phishing email, as well as acknowledge the submitter. You might say, "Well that's great, but how do I start?"</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Start passively: The <span style="font-size: 0.975em; background-position: initial; font-family: Georgia, 'Source Serif Pro', serif;"><em>passive</em></span> method involves setting up an easy way for the submitter to get that suspicious email into the system of record for triage. It's essentially a customer-facing front end for your security team. This can be done with a web form which will collect the submitter's info and a copy of the email or by simply asking your users to continue forwarding emails to <a title="ilto:phishing@acmecorp.com/" href="http://mailto:phishing@acmecorp.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" style="background-position: initial; color: #8c68cb;" target="_blank">phishing@acmecorp.com</a> but this time there is a system that can parse out the info and send an acknowledgment back to the submitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Once the email is received, the system automatically scans the message for malware and compare data from the header, body, and attachments against known IoCs (Indicators of Compromise).</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">It's important to note that this isn't about replacing your email security. But with the exception of solutions that do an additional check at the time a URL within an email is clicked, most email scanning is done prior to delivery to the recipient's mailbox, so once a phishing email makes it inside the network, it's free to spread.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Grow to active: A more <span style="font-size: 0.975em; background-position: initial; font-family: Georgia, 'Source Serif Pro', serif;"><em>active</em></span> response would involve the security analyst searching the mail store for additional copies of the phishing email to delete before they can be opened or clicked. But deleting someone else's email sounds like it could go very badly. Can you trust the overeager newbie not to delete something important by mistake?</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">You <span style="background-position: initial; font-weight: bold;">can</span> with the right system and controls in place. A smart system won't let the emails get deleted until they've been programatically confirmed as malicious. A smart system won't require your security analyst to login to a mail store and begin a search.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="background-position: initial; font-weight: bold;">The </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20.475px; font-family: Georgia, 'Source Serif Pro', serif; background-position: initial;"><em>Proactive</em></span><span style="background-position: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Way: Enterprise Security Response!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Now you can take the learnings from this investigation to make your security products smarter by updating sensors with newly discovered IoCs. Today, that is time-consuming, as each product, from firewall, to EDR, to SIEM, needs to be updated manually and individually. But with an Enterprise Security Response system, that data can be pushed out to point products quickly and automatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">The final proactive step brings us back to that security awareness training to address the human vulnerability. But instead of the canned training video, you can use the most tailored and real-world training. For example, you could notify users who received but didn't report a phishing email. If you deleted a possible attack email from a user's mailbox, inform them via a message. (This step can even be automated for simplicity.)</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">You can also send real-life examples (with harmful links removed) to users to give them a better idea of what to look for. This way training is customized to your organization instead of generic lessons that don't really prepare users to identify phishing attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Even with better security education, phishing emails are still a serious threat. Employing Enterprise Security Response can make triage easier and faster, while providing you the tools to limit damage and better identify future threats.</p>
