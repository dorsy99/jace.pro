<p><span class="s1">By default, a knowledge article can be attached to an incident from Contextual Search Results under the "Possible Solution" tab. The only missing part here is that you will only be able to select from a limited list of Knowledge articles based from the search results. If your article is not listed in those search results, you cannot link it to the incident through this method. And after you linked the article, you can't remove it form the incident if any modification is needed.</span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let me introduce a different method to attach specific <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual_search/concept/c_DeflectResolve.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual_search/concept/c_DeflectResolve.html">knowledge articles to an incident.</a> If you know the Knowledge article ID number beforehand, you can<strong> use a new UI Macro with knowledge reference lookup</strong> to achieve this. This allows the attached knowledge list to be added to the incident form. From the newly created tab(e.g "Related Knowledge Articles" tab in our example), internal users can search for the corresponding knowledge articles using the KB's ID number and attach the article directly to the current incident. Once the KB article is attached, it will be displayed on the list within the same tab. If you decide that the article does not relate to the incident, you can reverse the link and detach the article from the incident after.</span></p><p class="p1"></p><h1 class="p1">Example of attaching a KB article to an existing incident using a UI Macro with Knowledge reference lookup:</h1><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">1. Currently, there is no article attached to the following incident INT2929192.</p><p class="p1"><img   alt="example article.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" src="be5bb4cadbdcdfc03eb27a9e0f9619d0.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 183px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">2. In this example, we plan to add a known KB article: KB0000003 to this incident. We can either add the KB number to the input box or search for it by clicking the search icon next. After the KB number is entered, click "Attach" button to trigger the action.</p><p class="p1"><img   alt="add kb to int.png" class="image-7 jive-image" src="fd22c802db985fc03eb27a9e0f96198f.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 201px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">3. Once the article is attached, it will be automatically added to the attached articles list below the input box. An information message will also shown up.</p><p class="p1"><img   alt="kb added.jpg" class="image-8 jive-image" src="9901ef3ddb9c9fc0b322f4621f96193a.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 241px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">4. If the Knowledge Base article is no longer needed for this incident, you can easily remove it from this incident by clicking "Detach" button on the KB article record.</p><p class="p1"><img   alt="detach kb int.png" class="image-9 jive-image" src="cb3c0542db14d344e9737a9e0f961921.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 223px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">Now you are equipped with a new method to attach and detach a known Knowledge article to existing incidents. This method provides a more interactive way for eligible users to <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual_search/concept/c_DeflectResolve.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual_search/concept/c_DeflectResolve.html">manage all the needed KB articles</a> for their incident with ease.</p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The code for the UI Macro and Script includes are attached to this post, feel free to download the code and edit/trim it to fit your needs.</span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">PS: Many thanks to <a title="jesse.williams" __default_attr="12764" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="jesse.williams" data-renderedposition="2727.875_137.78125_90_18" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=514152e5db981fc09c9ffb651f9619d3">jesse.williams</a> for helping to design the solution.</span></p>
