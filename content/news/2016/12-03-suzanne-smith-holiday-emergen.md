<p class="p1">'Tis the season and no matter how you celebrate, we want to help you keep your ServiceNow instances going strong. The holidays can mean different things to different ServiceNow administrators. Some instances do extra work during the holidays and some have slower traffic. Perhaps maintenance or an upgrade is scheduled. Often, key people are taking time off so those on duty must perform new or unfamiliar tasks. We have put together a list of resources that can help you quickly manage a variety of situations.</p><p class="p1"></p><h1 class="p1">Instance holiday emergency prep kit</h1><ul><li>Understanding the change freeze</li><li>Scheduling upgrades</li><li>Resolving HI password issues</li><li>Downloading ServiceNow mobile</li><li>Searching for answers and resolving issues</li><li>Reaching out to customer support</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"></p><h2>Change freeze</h2><p>Our standard ServiceNow procedure is to implement a change freeze during the holiday and New Year time period. For 2016-2017, the change freeze is scheduled for Monday, December 19th through Tuesday, January 3rd. During this time, there are no ServiceNow initiated changes, but customers can continue to initiate changes on their own instances, including upgrades. For more details, see <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0598697" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0598697">ServiceNow Holiday Change Freezes</a>.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="keep-calm-it-s-a-change-freeze.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="213" src="4453b406db589344e9737a9e0f961922.iix" style="width: 183px; height: 213.5px;" width="183"/></p><p></p><h2>Upgrade info</h2><p>Over the holidays, you can still schedule upgrades, even during the change freeze time period. Use the standard procedure of navigating to the Hi Service Portal and selecting <strong>Manage Upgrades</strong>. You'll see a list of all your instances and, for each instance, the upgrades that are available. Just pick an instance, select a version, and click the <strong>Schedule</strong> button. For complete upgrading information, see <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/upgrades/concept/upgrades-overview.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/upgrades/concept/upgrades-overview.html">Upgrade your instance </a>and the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/upgrades/upgrades-planning-checklist.html#upgrade-planning-checklist" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-release-notes/page/release-notes/upgrades/upgrades-planning-checklist.html#upgrade-planning-checklist">Upgrade planning checklist</a>.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="holiday_prep1.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="75cf01cedb14d304b322f4621f961941.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Resolve HI password issues</h2><p><a title=".service-now.com/" href="http://hi.service-now.com/">HI</a> is the ServiceNow customer service portal where you can obtain information, schedule upgrades, log incidents, and manage your instances. HI password issues are pesky, but easy to resolve. All HI users, including ServiceNow customers and partners can reset their own password from the login page. Here are links to more information for different kinds of users:</p><p></p><ul><li><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547255" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547255">Customers and partners</a></li><li><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547663" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547663">United States government customers</a></li><li><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547371" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547371">Customer administrators</a> (designated users that have extra powers on their instance and in HI to manage users and help with issues like resetting passwords)</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>Download ServiceNow mobile</h2><p>If you are on the go during the holidays and working from a location other than your desk at the office, give the ServiceNow mobile app a try.
