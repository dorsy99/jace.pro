<p>At the upcoming Richmond SNUG we will be hosting an optional <a title="fo.servicenow.com/LP=4986" href="http://info.servicenow.com/LP=4986">Performance Analytics Workshop</a><a title="fo.servicenow.com/LP=4986" href="http://info.servicenow.com/LP=4986">http://info.servicenow.com/LP=4986</a> in the morning before the SNUG begins. In this hands-on workshop, you will build a Performance Analytics dashboard for service owners, service workers, and executives to help them gain insight into a sample Incident Management process. You will learn the basics of selecting the right indicators and breakdowns to creating widgets to display in a dashboard with different visualizations.
