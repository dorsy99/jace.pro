<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Last week, our team exhibited at <a title="nite.microsoft.com/" href="http://ignite.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Ignite</a>, where we met with customers who stopped by our booth and presented a theater session, Bringing IT Best Practices to Microsoft Azure.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We also demoed our integrations with Microsoft such as:</span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>ServiceNow Cloud Management and Microsoft Azure:</strong> Provisioning Azure from a self-service catalog</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>ServiceNow and Microsoft Azure AD:</strong> Single-sign-on to ServiceNow utilizing Microsoft Azure AD</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>ServiceNow Event Management and Microsoft Operations Management Suite:</strong> Creating alerts in OMS, automatically triggering incidents in ServiceNow</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There were a few themes that stood out, particularly around management of cloud resources.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Visibility into cloud spending is top of mind</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Whether it was customers approaching us in our booth, or sessions focused on cloud, the overwhelming message we heard was that being able to manage the costs, and having visibility into cloud spend is important. IT Directors, Managers and Executives shared stories with us about challenges of not knowing which teams had provisioned VMs, whether or not they were using them, and how much they were paying for it. This leads to cloud sprawl and out of control costs and often results in IT paying for something they don't need. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">ServiceNow Cloud Management provides enterprises the ability to control cloud spending with a unified view of billing information from multiple providers across multiple criteria, such as Azure, AWS and VMware. IT teams can also optimize the use of cloud, by having a single place to go to for information on actual spend vs. budget, and other parameters.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="Cost and Usage Dashboard.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="ddbdd10edb5c1b04ed6af3231f9619dd.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 297px;"/><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">ServiceNow Cloud Management Cost and Usage Dashboard</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Easy access to cloud resources, and the ability to control how they're deployed</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Another overwhelming theme was the inability to keep a pulse on end-users swiping credit cards to buy cloud resources, which creates headaches and security risks for enterprises. Multiple sessions focused on the importance of IT having a portal where they can set parameters for cloud resources, such as where they're deployed, which users can access them and for how long the VM can stay on. On the flip side, end users want an easy way to get access to cloud resources, without having to go straight to a provider.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">ServiceNow Cloud Management allows enterprise IT teams to set parameters adhering to corporate policies, and provide end users with the offers in a self-service catalog. This gives end users what they want, and IT can make sure that governance and control are in place. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="Self Service Catalog.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="112cf082db509f048c8ef4621f961911.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 336px;"/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">ServiceNow Cloud Management Self-Service Catalog</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you weren't able to visit us at Ignite contact your ServiceNow account rep or call 858-720-0477 to schedule a discussion with our experts.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">More Resources:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/cloud-management.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/cloud-management.html">ServiceNow Cloud Management</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/products/it-operations-management.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/it-operations-management.html">ServiceNow IT Operations Management </a></span></p>
