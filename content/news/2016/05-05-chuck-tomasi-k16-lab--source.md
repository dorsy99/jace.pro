<p>Hello fellow ServiceNow Developers!</p><p></p><p>Chris Maloy and I are excited to be in the first lab session following the opening key note on Tuesday May 17 at 10:00 to introduce you to one of our favorite Helsinki developer features - Source Control.</p><p></p><p>Join us for this hands-on lab as we introduce you to our Git integration, the ways it can help you manage your development across multiple releases, and the best practices to become effective. Chris, me, and a team of us have been working closely with the platform and integrations teams on this feature extensively for the past few months. We know once you start using it, you'll want to use it all the time.</p><p></p><p>Here's our agenda for this lab:</p><ul><li>Introduction to source control followed by a hands-on lab.</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Tagging and branching followed by a hands-on lab.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Conflict management followed by, yes, another lab.</span></li><li>Stashing, and of course, another lab.</li></ul><p></p><p>If you have been to one of my sessions in the past, you know that I encourage participation - OK, perhaps "bribe" is a better word. Note for newbies - sit close to the front.</p><p></p><p>Sign up today and I'll see you in Vegas!</p>
