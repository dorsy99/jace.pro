<p>The Geneva release contains Connect, a messaging platform that enables you to collaborate in real time. Connect is integrated with other useful ServiceNow features such as Visual Task Boards, Human Resources Service Management, and Customer Service Management, so you can work more efficiently. Connect is an excellent alternative to inefficent options such as email, phone calls, and standard chat programs. We won't even talk about scribbling notes and other forms of unstructured data.</p><p></p><p>There are two flavors of Connect:</p><ul><li>Use Connect Chat to work with individuals and groups</li><li>Use Connect Support if you are a support agent working with customers</li></ul><h2></h2><h2>Connect Chat</h2><p>Connect Chat is a great way for two or more people to work together. It can be especially useful for teams where members sit in different office locations or teams where all members are remote. Here are some of the ways Connect Chat can help you:</p><ul><li>Conduct group conversations between two or more users. Name the group, choose an avatar for the group, and add a description of the group. Add and remove users as necessary. Do an @mention so others in the group can, for example, click on the mentioned user's profile and send them a personal message.</li><li>Collaborate on a record. Open the record and drag an incident into the conversion. Conversations linked to records. Comments and work notes appear in conversations in real time and users can update the record directly from the conversation.</li><li>Synchronize with a visual task board. Conversations in Connect Chat and information in the visual task board are synchronized and updated in real time. On the visual task board - drag and drop files.</li><li>If you use the Chrome browser, take screenshots or images and copy/paste directly into Connect Chat conversations.</li><li>Stay aware of conversations by checking the badge icon in the upper right corner of your screen to see if you have unread messages.</li></ul><p>The following screenshot shows a conversation in the Connect Chat interface. The Attachment option is selected on the right side and 3 PDF files have been added to the conversation.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="connect1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="b96a33fddb50db048c8ef4621f9619a5.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 408px;"/></p><p></p><h2>Connect Support</h2><p>Connect Support combines the powerful tools of Connect Chat within a Service Desk interface. Connect Support uses many of the same features as Connect Chat, but is designed to have chat queues that give users access to real-time support and that show support agents a list of users requiring assistance. Reconsider how live support is provided and allow agents to resolve issues faster. Here's how Connect Support can help you:</p><ul><li>Share valuable, existing information by dragging and dropping links, files, and records into ongoing conversations.</li><li>Keep chats organized in a separate Support tab that appears on the Connect sidebar. The tab also enables agents to work multiple cases simultaneously.</li><li>Search and pull in existing information easily with the integrated knowledge base - drag and drop a relevant article into the chat.</li><li>Enable support agents to accept cases from the queue, transfer cases to another agent, and escalate cases as appropriate.</li><li>Define notification preferences for a case, such as mobile, desktop, and email email notifications.</li></ul><p>The following screenshot shows the queues in Connect Support:</p><p></p><p><img   alt="connect support multitask.gif" class="image-3 jive-image" src="9d66e9cadb1053043eb27a9e0f961916.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 335px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><h2>Additional Information</h2><ul><li>View the product information for complete details about <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/use/collaboration/concept/c_Connect.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/collaboration/concept/c_Connect.html">Connect Chat</a> and <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/use/collaboration/concept/c_ConnectSupport.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/collaboration/concept/c_ConnectSupport.html">Connect Support</a>.</li><li>In the community, <a title="howellm" __default_attr="21398" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="howellm" data-renderedposition="1619.546875_154.21388244628906_72_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=f7135a65db1c1fc09c9ffb651f9619d1">howellm</a> had a good question about <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=f7bb4fa1db9cdbc01dcaf3231f9619c4">using chat actions with Connect Chat</a>.
