<p>It's been far too long since I recorded an episode of The Enterprise Cloudcast. While I could come up with many reasons why I have been remiss on my podcasting, I will simply point out that Episode 6 is finally here for your listening pleasure. I hope you enjoy this episode where we dive deeper into the pros and cons of both multi-tenant and multi-instance cloud architecture. Feedback and comments always welcome!</p><p></p><p>Click below to listen!</p><h1><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="font-color-normal" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=b03d6ae5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619b4">The Enterprise Cloudcast: Multi-tenant versus Multi-instance Cloud Architectures Episode 6</a></span></h1>
