Governance is an important conversation that needs to happen early on and throughout your ServiceNow journey. Governance allows a company to outline and stick to their goals and visions. It allows an organization to create a structure that will start development off on the right foot. Within a team, it keeps people accountable. Like any organization, team, or even project - good organization at every step and revisiting your purpose and goal can help guide you to success. This is where governance comes into play.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="servicenow governance ebook2.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="173" src="08a3c88edbd8d3041dcaf3231f961984.iix" style="float: right; height: 173px; width: 210.705128205128px;" width="210"/></p><p>When done correctly governance can:</p><ul><li>Gives you a glimpse into the future by proactively forecasting demand for products and services</li><li>Make decisions easy-peasy with transparency of processes</li><li>Make educated business decisions</li></ul><p></p><p>In collaboration with <a title="w.caskllc.com/" href="http://www.caskllc.com/">Cask LLC</a>, ServiceNow was able to put together the ultimate <a title="w.servicenow.com/products/governance-risk-and-compliance.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/governance-risk-and-compliance.html">Governance foundation </a>resources to help you and your organization start off strong.
