<p>Hi SN community,</p><p></p><p>we are pretty new to this community and we are looking to implement ServiceNow as our main ITSM system. We have some experience with other ITSM tools, but we failed during the implementation.</p><p></p><p>Right now I would like to collect some implementation feedback from other companies.</p><ul><li>How did the ServiceNow implementation work for you?</li><li>Did you have some bigger issues? If so, what was it? What worked fine?</li><li>How quick did you implement it?</li><li>Can you share other experiences?</li></ul><p></p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Alexander</p>
