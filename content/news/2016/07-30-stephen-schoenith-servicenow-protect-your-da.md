<p>In the age of automation and productivity, we often overlook the security impact of automation (of everything). Since the release of Aspen, ServiceNow introduced inbound email actions, allowing ServiceNow users to initiate workflows or interact with service management functions via email. While these are perfectly safe to use, it is critical your instance is set up properly. As with all security relevant settings, misconfigured email actions can be abused by attackers. For example, it can be used to send malicious attachments or phishing emails to your ServiceNow instance. We are going to take a look at what inbound email actions are and how you can use them safely and securely to ensure you are using your ServiceNow instance that enables the business while keeping your data and users secure.</p><p><img   alt="meme_automate_everything.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="dc1409c2db141b04ed6af3231f961901.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; float: none;"/></p><p>Inbound email actions enable users to automatically create or update records when an email is sent to your ServiceNow instance. Inbound email actions are similar to <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/script/business-rules/concept/c_BusinessRules.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/script/business-rules/concept/c_BusinessRules.html">business rules</a>, using both conditions and scripts. ServiceNow leverages watermarking ids inside the email body (or subject) in order to associate it to a task such as an incident or problem. For detailed examples of email actions that interact with incidents, problems, and change requests, see <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/administer/notification/reference/r_InboundEmailActionExamples.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/administer/notification/reference/r_InboundEmailActionExamples.html">Examples of Inbound Email Actions</a>.</p><p></p><p>You can edit your inbound email action to add, disable, or modify them as necessary.</p><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>System Policy &gt; Email &gt; Inbound Actions</strong><ul><li>Note: Must be an Administrator to edit these.

I mean, after all, it was the theme to our Knowledge conference a while ago (Automate or Die!). But it doesn't come without a word of caution. Automate what can be automated, but keep a tight-reign on areas that it is better to be safe than sorry.
