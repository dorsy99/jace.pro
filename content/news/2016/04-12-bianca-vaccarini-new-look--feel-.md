<p>In November 2015, we launched <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/category/geneva" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/category/geneva">docs.servicenow.com</a>, a departure from the wiki. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, we continued to develop improvements for the next generation of the site. The next generation is here! This version of docs.servicenow.com is the latest phase in our quest to provide a richer, smoother experience with ServiceNow documentation. There's more to come — but let's take a look at what's new today.</p><p></p><p>What's new?</p><ul><li>The user interface</li><li>Searching for content</li><li>How you consume content offline</li><li>Sharing feedback with us</li></ul><p></p><h3>It has an improved user interface that is easier on the eyes.</h3><p>We've made it easier to identify topics to browse right from the front page. It gives you a starting point in tile form to get you started. If you know exactly what you want to find documentation on, the search bar is still provided on every page.</p><p><img   alt="product doc 1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="94c880c2dbdc5fc068c1fb651f96198b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 387px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><h2></h2><h3>It has facets that allow you to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=a6dd2ae9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619a0">search by product area and version.</a></h3><p>Let's say you want to see everything related to authentication in the Geneva release notes. There's a facet for that! For example, if you search for "Authentication" through the search bar you can further filter your results based on product area and versions within the search results page.</p><p><img   alt="product doc 2.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="aafa2bfddbd09b048c8ef4621f9619c9.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 362px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><h3></h3><h3>It allows you to create your own PDFs for offline reading.</h3><p>This feature is for those of you who want to read about what's new in IT Operations Management on your long flight without Wi-Fi. You can download a PDF of the release notes for ITOM and read it wherever, and whenever. Save your favorite topics and subtopics to refer to later so you can always be in-the-know.</p><p><img   alt="product doc 3.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="59b9cd4adb9497049c9ffb651f9619e8.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 354px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h3>Send ratings and feedback — without email</h3><p>The documentation team at ServiceNow loves to hear from you!
