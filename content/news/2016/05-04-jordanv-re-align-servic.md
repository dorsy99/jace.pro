<p>With the upgrade to Geneva came a number of updates to the user interface for the Service Catalog. As the Service Catalog is highly customizable with complex use cases, two distinct issues have arisen from these changes. The cause is primarily due to the stylesheet applied to forms outside the Service Catalog being applied within the Service Catalog as well. This corrupted the display of <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-it-service-management/page/product/service_catalog_management/concept/c_ServiceCatalogVariableSets.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-it-service-management/page/product/service_catalog_management/concept/c_ServiceCatalogVariableSets.html">Service Catalog Variables</a> as well as the question text in <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-it-service-management/page/product/service_catalog_management/concept/c_RecordProducer.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-it-service-management/page/product/service_catalog_management/concept/c_RecordProducer.html">Record Producers</a> and we have taken on the feedback from our customers to resolve these issues in Geneva Patch 6.</p><p></p><p>If this applies to you, you will notice:</p><p>1. Variables are not aligned on forms in the Service Catalog.</p><p>2. The alignment of variable question text/labels is moved to left of input box instead of above the input box.</p><p></p><h1>Indented Variable Alignment</h1><p>This issue is characterized by variables contained in variable sets being indented when displayed on forms in the Service Catalog. This issue stems from the stylesheet being applied to the Service Catalog and has been resolved in Geneva Patch 6 which includes a separate background colour for variable editors on RITM and SC Task forms.</p><p></p><p>If you are experiencing catalog variable alignment issues, they look like this:</p><p><img   alt="varibale alignment geneva catalog.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="ce74d40adb5817049c9ffb651f9619c6.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 383px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>When they should actually be left aligned as so:</p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-02 at 2.30.08 pm.JPG" class="image-4 jive-image" src="b105d10adb18130468c1fb651f9619da.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 191px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>For customers who don't want the background color, we have added a property "glide.sc.hide_variable_editor_background" to disable it with Geneva Patch 6.<span style="color: #eb7a3d;"><br/></span></p><p></p><p>See <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0565455" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0565455">ServiceNow KB: Variables are not aligned on sc_req_item page if using variable set (KB0565455)</a> Â  for more detail.

Questions on the service catalog items are typically very long and descriptive to make it easy for requestors to fill in. This has resulted in very bad wrapping of the labels and resulted in large amounts of whitespace on record producers.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="question label geneva alignment.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="20387371dbd05fc03eb27a9e0f9619dd.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 417px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>The wrapping of the text labels is fixed in Geneva Patch 4. We decided to revert to the old styling of labels at the top of the Service Catalog controls. Questions do not have a border and the UI follows the platform styling.
