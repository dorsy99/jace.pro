<p>It's the week before Knowledge16 and everyone is getting pretty excited around here about seeing our customers, partners, and developers in Las Vegas!</p><p></p><p>Over the weekend I just happened to check the <a title="t.ly/1Rw7jdA" href="http://bit.ly/1Rw7jdA">ServiceNow Store</a> (cause that's what I do) and observed that there are now 166 certified applications and integrations from nearly 100 Technology Partners available on the Store. That is exactly double the number at Store launch at Knowledge15 a year ago!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="store_166.PNG" class="image-1 jive-image" src="eabb6006db5857049c9ffb651f961984.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 335px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>This is testament to the health and growth of the ServiceNow Platform ecosystem and provides customers a diverse range of certified ready-to-deploy apps and integrations   - solving a much broader range of business problems than ServiceNow could ever do alone. It's also a nice option for a customer to have - to be able to buy and immediately install, vs. building from scratch.   Our CTO <a title="allan.leinwand" __default_attr="12646" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="allan.leinwand" data-renderedposition="557.8834838867188_67.7414779663086_109_15" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=d621d665db981fc09c9ffb651f96193c">allan.leinwand</a> did a great job of explaining why the ecosystem is so important<a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=972de6e5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961932"> in this blog post </a>   -   so I won't repeat the wheel here. But the doubling of the # of apps is not the only metric demonstrating this   healthy and growing ecosystem - we're seeing even steeper growth in the # of customers and installs on the Store - we'll be sharing some data on that at the Global PartnerNow Summit on Monday May 16th at the Driving Your Business With The ServiceNow Store breakout session.   We look forward to seeing you there and at Knowledge16.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="Now_Certified_120x120_Red_01.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="f85b840adbd017049c9ffb651f96197e.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Everything on the Store is certified by ServiceNow for functionality, security, performance, and platform integration/interoperability.</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">With the market launch of Helsinki we are excited to see apps get upgraded   and to see brand new apps   that leverage all of the powerful new developer features of Helsinki.</p>
