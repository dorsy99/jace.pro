I have worked at Linium for over 14 years, assisting our clients on the journey to modernization by harnessing the power of the ServiceNow platform. My passion lies with enabling the delivery of business services anytime, anywhere, on any device. I firmly believe service management encompasses not just IT in the traditional sense, but rather the enterprise - HR, Sales, Facilities, Marketing, and beyond. This involves thinking differently, pushing the boundaries to deliver everything as a service, and providing the experience modern users demand. I have those modern conveniences in my personal life; why shouldn't I have those same experiences at work as it relates to delivering and acquiring the business services I need to do my job? At Linium, our mission is to make that a reality through the power of ServiceNow and <strong><a title="w.linium.com/" href="http://www.linium.com/">change the way people work</a></strong>. </span></p><p class="Default"></p><p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Be a Part of the Service Revolution</strong></span></p><p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">If you're looking to connect with members of the ServiceNow community, Knowledge is the place to be. With hundreds of sessions, you're going to be in the center of the service revolution. Now is the time to embrace the digital world that we live in and translate those efficiencies to our work life. At Linium, we accomplish this by developing solutions that are customer obsessed and customer-driven. We place the 'people factor' first, focusing in on the customer - the end-user who will seek value from the solution and the culture - the people whom will support and deliver this service. We believe in taking innovation to new heights whether it's streamlining any manual processes, delivering the most advanced user interface and user experiences or retiring legacy apps. To us, it's about revolutionizing the delivery of services to our customers and their customers. This revolution starts with you!</span></p><p class="Default"></p><p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Stop by Booth #1208</strong></span></p><p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">While you're at Knowledge, stop by the Linium <strong><a title="w.linium.com/events-and-webinars/knowledge16-conference-las-vegas-nv" href="http://www.linium.com/events-and-webinars/knowledge16-conference-las-vegas-nv">booth #1208</a></strong>.

I encourage you to join Linium's instructors for a session on how to use mobile to go from reactive to proactive. We all rely on our mobile devices to get information, provide options, and request service delivery anytime, anywhere. In this CreatorCon session, my colleagues will show you how to make the shift from reactive to proactive by building a mobile application that allows you to: receive a weather alert, see the past impact of similar weather events on your business locations, and proactively request recovery services to be available at your business location to limit business risk and exposure.   This session, <strong><a title="w.linium.com/events-and-webinars/events/servicenow-creatorcon-knowledge16" href="http://www.linium.com/events-and-webinars/events/servicenow-creatorcon-knowledge16">Using Mobile to go from Reactive to Proactive</a></strong>, is scheduled on Thursday, May 19 from 3:50pm — 5:40pm in Oceanside D.   </span></p><p class="Default"></p><p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Whether you're tasked with automating business services, managing projects from start-to-finish or prevent service outages, we'll help you work better, faster, and smarter.
