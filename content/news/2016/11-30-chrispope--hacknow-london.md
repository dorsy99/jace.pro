There is still time to register and attend what is going to be a fantastic event. With 2 recent events under our belts in India and Australia, the level of innovation and creativity has been incredible, and London will raise the bar again.</p><p></p><p>Lots of registrations are in, with a great mixture of customers and partners, we will see a great variety of problems being solved. We are very fortunate at this event to have a true thought leader in this space with us in <a title="witter.com/ABridgwater" href="https://twitter.com/ABridgwater">Adrian Bridgwater</a>. Â  I have been lucky to collaborate on a few things recently with Adrian and his enthusiasm for the #HackNow event has been evident from day 1. I am sure he will be pushing and trying to inspire the teams to do more and push the boundaries.</p><p></p><p>If you have already registered then Thank You and we look forward to seeing you there.
