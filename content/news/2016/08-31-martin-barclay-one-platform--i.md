<p style="text-align: center;"><img  alt="ServiceNow_Store_Hero_Banner_1250x195_Plain.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="ae1ec186db1897049c9ffb651f961978.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 97px;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">On August 3rd, just   five quarters (that's 1.25 years) after opening at Knowledge15, the <a title="t.ly/2coOQod" href="http://bit.ly/2coOQod">ServiceNow Store</a> reached 200 certified and published apps. 200 apps in 15 categories from 118 Technology Partners. All of them certified by ServiceNow to ensure platform compatibility, performance, security and a user experience that ServiceNow customers are familiar with. About   one in three ServiceNow customers has now tried or installed into production at least one app from the Store. Amazing given that 15 months ago no ServiceNow customer had done that. And a majority of them are repeat Store customers, having installed at least two apps into production.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img  alt="sn-store-logo-420x80-r_80.png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="45dd2486db18dfc068c1fb651f9619fd.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;">The growth in the number and diversity of apps on the Store is testament of what developers can do (and have done) with the ServiceNow platform and the breadth of business challenges that customers can solve with apps way beyond anything that ServiceNow could ever do alone. The ServiceNow Store is one proof point among many of   not just the value of the platform itself,   but even more importantly of the developer and partner ecosystem that has grown and evolved on top of it.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">To mark the publishing of the 200th app, we've published a <strong><a title="w.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/infographics/info-whats-in-store.pdf" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/infographics/info-whats-in-store.pdf">What's In Store Infographic</a></strong> that illustrates the types of apps and integrations available on the Store from our Technology Partners for IT and outside IT (yes, outside IT), some of the key milestones reached along the way, and the growth trajectory we're on.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">The latest app to be published as of time of writing (that didn't make it into the infographic - content deadlines!) is the <a title="t.ly/2bDvwSv" href="http://bit.ly/2bDvwSv">Skype for Business integration</a> from Sensiple that enables ServiceNow customers that use Skype for Business for enterprise UC to get screen pops and view, update, and create ServiceNow incidents associated with the inbound caller (voice or IM) right from Skype for Business. Another highlight worth mentioning is the winner in the Business Category at the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=26ac6625dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96191d">CreatorCon Hackathon</a> at Knowledge16 - <a title="t.ly/2bGF3G3" href="http://bit.ly/2bGF3G3">CreatorDoc</a>-   is now available on the Store. Published by Enable Professional Services, CreatorDoc enables customers to transform Word documents into ServiceNow tables and records for automating document management workflows. Pretty cool stuff from our partners.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">As of right now, we're 204 certified and published apps (and plenty more in the pipeline) closer to infinity.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p><img   alt="infinity.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="307" src="a5d5d14edb18d344e9737a9e0f961919.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 307px; height: 307px;" width="307"/></p>
