<p>We want your feedback! ServiceNow has been experimenting with a pilot program to get your questions answered quicker and more effectively by posting them from HI to the community. That means what would be considered a Priority-4 incident in HI gets routed to the community to call upon the 50,000 members here for help.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="hi+question+to+community.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="a46df44adb9497041dcaf3231f9619a9.iix" style="line-height: 1.5; width: 620px; height: 266px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Assuming you're a member of our pilot program, have you had an opportunity to try the new HI to Community question-posting feature?
