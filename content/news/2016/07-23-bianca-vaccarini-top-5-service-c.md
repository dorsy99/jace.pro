<p>The Service Catalog offers a ton of flexibility to organizations to configure in a way that can service their business needs. With the release of Helsinki, a lot of our Geneva users are looking to make sure their instance is in the right state of mind before even considering on upgrading. If you own the Service Catalog and are on certain patches and hot fixes of Fuji, Geneva, or Helsinki, take a gander at these top Service Catalog solutions. You can also subscribe to them to get email notifications when aspects of the known error are updated.</p><p></p><h1>Here are the top 5 Service Catalog solutions in Geneva:</h1><p></p><h3>1. <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563990" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563990">Function toggleHelp() on catalog client scripts throws JavaScript errors in Geneva</a></h3><p>This is because the toggleHelp() is obsolete in Geneva and it causes JavaScript errors in the Catalog. It is fixed in Geneva Patch 5 and in Helsinki. You can also try the workaround suggested by <a title="w.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/showhide-service-catalog-variable-help-text/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/showhide-service-catalog-variable-help-text/">SNC Guru.</a></p><p></p><h3>2. <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0594575" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0594575">Catalog UI policies not applying to variables in a RITM / Catalog Task variable editor when read-only</a></h3><p>Catalog UI policies and catalog client scripts set to 'Applies on Requested Items' or 'Applies on Catalog Tasks' can fail when a write-role has been specified on the variable and a user views the record while impersonating a user. Â  To workaround it you can create an onLoad catalog client script that applies only to RITM and Catalog Task (not on the catalog item).</p><p></p><h3>3. <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563711" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0563711">Since the Berlin release, it is no longer possible to drill through Reference Icons that are in variables.</a></h3><p>Releases after Berlin do not allow you to drill down in the reference icons by design. This behavior is seen in certain patches of Aspen, Berlin, Calgary and Fuji. Pre-Calgary releases can workaround it by hovering over the icon to view the referenced record.</p><p></p><h3>4. <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0562895" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0562895">More information tag on Service Catalog Variables turns HTML into escaped text</a></h3><p>When attempting to use HTML in a help_text field on a service catalog variable, the content renders as escaped text. The HTML tags in variables 'help text' are only interpreted when the system property named glide.ui.escape_text is set to <strong>false</strong>. This was fixed in the late patches of Fuji, Geneva Patch 3, and Helsinki.</p><p><img   alt="undefined help text.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="8a0e2bfddb981fc068c1fb651f9619dd.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 159px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h3>5. <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0584845" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0584845">SCStaleCacheListener.java causes sys_cache_flush table to bloat, stalling upgrades</a></h3><p>SCStaleCacheListener listens to inserts/updates/deletes on the sys_user, sys_user_role, and sys_user_has_role tables. This affects user_items_cache and user_categories_cache for every domain in the system, potentially causing sys_cache_flush to have millions of records and stalling upgrades. If you are not using User Criteria, you can work around this by turning off glide.sc.use_user_criteria by setting it to <strong>false</strong>.</p><p></p><p>When something goes awry in your Service Catalog, check the product documentation to see if set it up right. Then check the ServiceNow Knowledge Base in HI to see if the issue you are experiencing in the catalog is actually a bug. If it is an issue we are aware of, you can bet that there is an article in the KB on it.</p>
