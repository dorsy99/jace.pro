<p>According to Aberdeen Group, "74% of service requests start as emails." Does that sound like your situation? And if it does, why should you care? The answer is simple: <a title="w.servicenow.com/lpayr/aberdeen-bring-itsm-into-the-modern-age-with-end-user-self-service-support.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/lpayr/aberdeen-bring-itsm-into-the-modern-age-with-end-user-self-service-support.html">research shows</a> that end users want to help themselves, and not being able to do so could be hurting your customer satisfaction ratings. </p><p></p><p><strong>So what's the problem?</strong></p><p>In the modern era of online shopping and gratification at the click of a button, your end users' expectations are high. Unfortunately, the Â  legacy IT service solutions still supporting a large number of enterprises just don't cut it. For example, sending an email into a "black hole" with no visibility into its status or control over its outcome does <strong>not</strong> fit into that expectation of an effortless, on-demand experience. In fact, email as a channel for service delivery results in a <a title="ww.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/infographics/infographic-state-of-work.pdf" href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/infographics/infographic-state-of-work.pdf">productivity drain</a> for both parties, and your end users are not happy about it.</p><p></p><p><strong>What can you do to change it? </strong></p><p>The answer is a well-designed self-service portal. Most common requests (computer issues, password resets, ordering equipment, obtaining access rights, etc.) can be handled autonomously, but typically aren't because the right tools and processes are not in place. A well-planned self-service portal solves this dilemma by providing defined lines of service, timelines for service requests (SLAs), on-demand status checks, and designated workflows that map a ticket's journey to approval or fulfillment as soon as it begins.</p><p></p><p>Previously, you have been may be inclined to equate quality customer service with pleasant and timely face-to-face interactions. But in today's world, that definition has morphed into one that also includes transparency, independence and speed. Now that you know the solution to making your customers happy, bring your IT service management into the modern age with end-user self-service support.
