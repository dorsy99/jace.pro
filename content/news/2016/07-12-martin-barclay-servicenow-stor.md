This allows ServiceNow Partner Managers to verify the leads and connect certain deals with Customer Sales Reps.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To register or update a lead simply go to the Sales &amp; Customers page and click on the Leads tab. From this page you can update existing leads or Submit a Lead.   This allows you to enter the deal information such as contract terms, amounts, and expected close date.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By registering leads this enables you to have a conversation with your ServiceNow Partner Manager where they can advise you regarding the customer and may pull in the Customer Sales Rep to help you drive the deal.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Available </strong></span>Custom App Subscription Agreement</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Many partners have requested the ability to tie a custom app subscription legal agreement to an app purchase.   Previously, partners can add the agreement to an app version which requires the customer to agree to on the Store prior to being entitled to the app.   Now we are taking this one step further and enabling partners to provide a custom agreement per customer.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To add a custom agreement per customer you can go to the Sales &amp; Customers page and find the customer lead that you want to tie the agreement to.   Next to the lead you should see the action to Update App Subscription Agreement.   Clicking on this will prompt you to upload a PDF of the custom agreement.   Note, by providing a custom agreement tied to a customer it will overwrite any prior uploaded app subscription agreement.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><strong>Available </strong></strong></span>Multi-version Support</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We realize that enterprise apps may not be a one size fits all.   Customers may be on different ServiceNow releases.   Because of this partners have the ability to publish multiple versions of an app allowing customers to find the right version that is compatible with their ServiceNow solution.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>TIP</strong>: The Store does not automatically remove previously published versions.   Ensure you review all your published versions on <a title="pp.servicenow.com/" href="https://tpp.servicenow.com/">https://tpp.servicenow.com</a> and withdraw any versions you don't want published on the store.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Finally, if you didn't receive the quarterly Store News for partners, we've recently published the first Store <a title="w.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/case-studies/cs-fairview-health.pdf" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/case-studies/cs-fairview-health.pdf">customer case study</a> and <a title="outu.be/Dc-2Ww3VMTQ" href="https://youtu.be/Dc-2Ww3VMTQ">customer-facing video.</a></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Happy selling!</span></p>
