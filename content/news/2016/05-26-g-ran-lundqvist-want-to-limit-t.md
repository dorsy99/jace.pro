<p>Some people might find it kind of annoying when you make a gauge for the home page and when you look at it, you will get more than enough of records and it will cover the whole screen leaving the rest down below.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps something like this:</p><p><img  alt="homepage 1.PNG" class="image-5 jive-image" src="2edf15cadb5c13043eb27a9e0f961952.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 317px;"/></p><p>The list gauge just keeps showing all the records without any limits <span __jive_emoticon_name="sad" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="433_432_16_16" src="/8.0.1.35b65d4/images/emoticons/sad.png"></span> Making the things below disappear.</p><p>As you can see it shows all the records(1 to 11) on the same "page".</p><p></p><p>Well, how about have it like this instead:</p><p><img  alt="homepage 2.PNG" class="image-2 jive-image" src="4c243c0edb1cdfc03eb27a9e0f961984.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;"/></p><p>Here you can see that I set a value of max 5 rows and suddenly the other gauges show up as well.</p><p></p><p>This is how you do it.</p><p></p><p>1. Go to the homepage pages and click on the homepage you want to change. Then you get this:</p><p></p><p><img  alt="homepage 3.PNG" class="image-3 jive-image" src="08159482db545304b322f4621f9619ea.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 290px;"/></p><p>2. Now click on the dropzone that you want to set it on. In my case it's the one inside the circle. Now you got the preference of that dropzone.</p><p>Click on new and create a preference with the name sysparm_rows_per_page(don't forget the underline thingie) and set the value to how many you want to have. In my case I picked 5.</p><p><img  alt="homepage 4.PNG" class="image-4 jive-image" src="9f287fb5dbd0d3049c9ffb651f961949.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 244px;"/></p><p></p><p>Now your gauge will only show the number of rows that you have picked. I noticed that this has stopped working in Helsinki and I'll put a HI-ticket on </p><p>it to hopefully get it fixed.</p><p></p><p>//Göran</p>
