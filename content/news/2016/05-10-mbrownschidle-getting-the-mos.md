<p>Intro: You can learn more about me here: <a title="ossfuze.com/mark-brownschidle" href="http://crossfuze.com/mark-brownschidle">http://crossfuze.com/mark-brownschidle</a>. </p><p></p><p>I have been in the business of delivering professional services to clients for the past 20 years. As the Vice President of Professional Services at Crossfuze, I'm excited to attend Knowledge16, my 6th Knowledge conference. For the past 6 years, I have lead and assisted with ServiceNow implementations for clients across North America. </p><p></p><p>There are so many reasons why Knowledge16 is my favorite event of the year—I typically respond based on who I'm talking with.   So where do I start?</p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">If you are just looking at ServiceNow, all the sessions will likely be informational and you will be able to network day and night with other organizations that have already gone down the ServiceNow path.</span></li></ul><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">If you are driving the strategic direction within your organization, how about a crystal ball into the future?   Since ServiceNow is leading the industry space in Service Management, the Keynote sessions provide the vision of where not only ServiceNow is going but the industry in general so that you can then apply the information learned to your organization's vision and roadmap for the future.</span></li></ul><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">If you are technical, perhaps you want to get hands-on? There are numerous hands-on labs that allow you to "test drive" the latest and greatest versions of ServiceNow applications with in-room assistants that will help you navigate your lab journey.</span></li></ul><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Need help with implementing ServiceNow? Visit the ExpoNow hall and see how the best ServiceNow Partners (like Crossfuze) are innovating the delivery of ServiceNow for their clients.</span></li></ul><p></p><p>As a ServiceNow Gold Services Partner, we have learned that the Knowledge conference is that one time each year when all of our clients are together which enables us to reconnect one-on-one and exchange info learned at the show. It's also a great time to connect with our ServiceNow contacts to catch up on current happenings.</p><p></p><p>At Knowledge16, Crossfuze will be showcasing 14 user-inspired Turnkeys with baked in best practices—designed to boost the performance of the ServiceNow platform. Our Turnkeys are also UAT ready in days and have been proven to significantly reduce configuration costs. </p><p></p><p>In addition, we will be discussing our iPOWER remote admin support program that helps clients eliminate the headaches of the revolving door syndrome—resources coming and going on a consistent basis. By participating in iPOWER, clients can also easily tap into our vast ServiceNow expertise when looking to expand the skills set of their current support team—without hiring FTEs. </p><p></p><p>In addition, we will discuss what went into winning the <strong>2015 Partner Customer Satisfaction Award</strong> in the Authorized tier. Having the highest ServiceNow CSAT score is because we do a lot of things <em>differently</em> than everyone else.   If you're looking to implementation ServiceNow or build upon what you have and want a better, more effective "mousetrap", stop by our booth (1406) for a quick demo of our world-renown Turnkeys.</p><p></p><p>Also, if you are interested in taking a meaningful souvenir home from Knowledge16, get your badge scanned at our booth to become eligible for all three of our show promotions for complimentary services—collectively valued at $57,500! We're looking forward to seeing everyone at Knowledge16! </p><p></p><p>Check out some fun photos from previous Knowledge events!</p><p></p><p>You can find us here: Twitter @Crossfuze</p><p>Mark @ LinkedIn: <a title="ww.linkedin.com/in/markbrownschidle" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markbrownschidle">https://www.linkedin.com/in/markbrownschidle</a></p><p> <img  alt="Blog Photos 1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="0607aff1db941fc068c1fb651f9619d5.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 512px;"/></p><p><img  alt="Blog Photos 2.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="575dcd86db189f048c8ef4621f9619af.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 502px;"/></p><p><img  alt="Blog Photos 3.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="abe760cedb54d704ed6af3231f9619fe.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 514px;"/></p><p><img  alt="Blog Photos 4.jpg" class="image-4 jive-image" src="f847084edb9cd3041dcaf3231f961948.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 465px;"/></p>
