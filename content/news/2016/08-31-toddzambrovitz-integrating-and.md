<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In a ServiceNow study last year, we identified that businesses are wasting about two days a week, or 40% of their time at work, spent on things that don't move the business forward. The reason? No centralized way to connect the people, process and things that make up how we get work done. The typical things we first</span> see <span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">happening is each departmental or organizational group goes and acquires or builds its own software that's focused on solving their specific problems. After a while, you've got silos of applications within these deparments. The problem is that none of them are connected in a way that allows them to work across departments, geographies and operational groups. But what if you need to get those groups working on the same page to achieve a common outcome? People are thinking about "how do I work" and not "how do we work". The second common pattern is that thre are a ton of repeatable processes within and across each department and LOB and none of them are automated. So now we've got manual</span><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> processes combined with completely disconnected systems. And finally, we've got a third pattern where groups rely on spreadsheets, email, phone calls and meetings in an attempt to create some level of process to connect all this disconnected diversity.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">H&amp;R Block was facing a very similar situation. During tax season, they have to open and close nearly 800 customer locations in a matter of weeks. The tasks they have to execute span from selecting and securing real estate locations, staffing, operations, IT support, customer support, marketing, legal and contracts and a number of other speciallized functions across the company. All in all, this process required the execution of over 60,000 tasks.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">During the joint webinar, H&amp;R presented how they leveraged custom applications built on the ServiceNow Platform to automate manual workflows associated with opening more than 800 locations in as little as three weeks â€” with just one and a half full-time technical resources while positively impacting the company's bottom line.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">We learned that with the ServiceNow Platform, H&amp;R Block was able to build apps that...</span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">drive value for individual workers and the entire global enterprise</span></li><li><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">automate work and integrate everything to focus on strategic value and maximize resources</span></li><li><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">deliver experiences that users across the enterprise love</span></li><li><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">empower their business while allowing IT to stay in control</span></li></ul><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Want to learn more about how you can build apps for a better way to work? </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="IS" style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Watch the webinar recording </span><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 11.0pt;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/content/servicenow/us/lpwbr/integrate-and-automate-60000-tasks-with-one-application.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/servicenow/us/lpwbr/integrate-and-automate-60000-tasks-with-one-application.html">here</a></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black;">.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">You can learn about H&amp;R Block Canada's journey from managing IT infrastructure to tapping the ServiceNow platform for internal operations and customer service in their </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: blue;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/customers/h-r-block-canada.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/customers/h-r-block-canada.html">case study</a></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">.
