<p>I've never been to Helsinki, or Finland for that matter, but Finland sure is a fascinating country.   I gathered some interesting facts about Finland a few weeks ago.   They are said to have the world's best pizza — even better than Italy's — and their love for heavy metal bands is so great, they have the highest per capita metal bands in the world.   For a small nation of 5 million people, they are a surprisingly pioneering country.   Finland, home to the Nokia brand, seems so well connected they have no payphones in the nation.   The world's first browser came out of Finland in 1994, yes even before Internet Explorer and Mosaic. They also brought us the Linux OS and the SMS among many other things.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="Innovation.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="655bcc8edb5c1304b322f4621f961921.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 325px;"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">         Image from cnbc.com</span></p><p></p><p>There may be some consistency in themes with respect to innovation, with the ServiceNow Helsinki release. ServiceNow continues to pioneer the consumerization of work, making IT Service Management an easy and delightful experience — much like what you are used to in your personal lives, and Helsinki is one more step in that direction.   The other big theme for the ITSM Helsinki release is that it's even faster and easier now to set up applications in ServiceNow.   This theme comes to you in the form of Guided Setup.   Helsinki makes ServiceNow's ITSM the first product to have a guided setup wizard.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Consumerization</strong></span></p><p>We continue to invest in consumerizing service management in the enterprise so it's easy for you to track your tasks on the go just as you would your Amazon.com order or search for something on Google.   ServiceNow believes that access to your services should be device agnostic.   So, even when you are not at your desk, you can check on the status of your tasks on your mobile device while you swing by the local Starbucks. This is true regardless of whether you are a fulfiller or an end user.   ServiceNow applications are natively mobile-compatible and with the Helsinki release, there's full support for the Android OS.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guided set up</strong></span></p><p>The Guided setup is your personal wizard that walks you through the setup process step by step with visual indicators that show the status of completion of various set up tasks. You can setup ServiceNow on your own, without the need for expert guidance. And with the help of the wizard, you can easily continue your set up where you last left off.   A detailed blog on this feature will be published soon.</p><p></p><p>Future blogs will have more details on everything you need to know about Helsinki.   If you have questions on Helsinki, feel free to post them in the comments section.   In the meanwhile, I hope to see you at <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/">Knowledge</a>!</p>
