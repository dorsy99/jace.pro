<p>This time I will show you an easy way to do some interactive filters on normal reports which also will work on homepages.</p><p></p><p>Now if you got Performance Analytics I would go to that instead and look at the "Interactive Filters" it will give you and here is a great post about that <a title="suzanne.smith" __default_attr="3285" __jive_macro_name="user" _jive_internal="true" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="suzanne.smith" data-renderedposition="52_946_111_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=b4e05261db981fc09c9ffb651f9619a0">suzanne.smith</a> wrote.

And many of them are similar. For example open incidents...</p><p>Some want to have a bar that groups the incident by assignment group. Some want it by Assignee. Then of course some want it on groups, but stacked with assignee. So if you wanna put it on a homepage, it would be a lot of reports. And if you don't want to give them access to the report itself where they can configure and change stuff without know what they really are doing..</p><p></p><p>Here is a small step on the way, making your life a little easier when giving the users the option to change the group by and stacked by on the homepage instead.</p><p></p><p>Since I started to like making videos, I did one for this as well.</p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/qZW8nPWs2nw" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p>Take care,</p><p>Göran</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Symfoni Logo Color Box.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="53" src="f8fd1d4edb5c1b04ed6af3231f961936.iix" style="width: 181px; height: 52.5484px;" width="181"/><img   alt="sn-advocate-135X48px.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="fc973486dbdc57049c9ffb651f9619e1.iix" style="height: auto;"/><img  alt="sn-community-mvp.png" class="image-3 jive-image" height="49" src="7c08bff9db5cdf04e9737a9e0f961909.iix" style="width: 138px; height: 49.0667px;" width="138"/>   </p>
