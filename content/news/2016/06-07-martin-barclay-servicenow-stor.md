<p>In honor of the ServiceNow Store's <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=972de6e5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961932">1st birthday</a> last month at Knowledge16, we've created a video to explain (in just about 60 seconds) the business value available to ServiceNow customers from our innovative Technology Partner ecosystem. We've heard that a lot of our customers aren't yet aware of the pure gold available on the Store from our hundreds of ISV partners   - so we're preparing a content tsunami to address that starting with this video.</p><p></p><p>There are now over 180 certified and ready-to-deploy apps and integrations on the Store   from 110 Technology Partners that can immediately solve a diverse range of business problems - from <a title="t.ly/22KqPHE" href="http://bit.ly/22KqPHE">integrating ServiceNow</a> into enterprise architectures to <a title="t.ly/1RVNhFM" href="http://bit.ly/1RVNhFM">slashing mobile telecom expenses</a> to <a title="t.ly/1UmZghl" href="http://bit.ly/1UmZghl">managing enterprise assets in highly regulated industries</a>.   There are also <a title="t.ly/1tdbcwy" href="http://bit.ly/1tdbcwy">chatbot</a> apps that enable instant approvals and resolutions/customer NPS scoring via text messaging without even being logged into ServiceNow, and <a title="t.ly/2145mrF" href="http://bit.ly/2145mrF">IFTTT style recipe apps</a> for web services orchestration. There's an <a title="t.ly/1XyzoWF" href="http://bit.ly/1XyzoWF">auction and esourcing</a> app. There's a <a title="t.ly/1YbMzeX" href="http://bit.ly/1YbMzeX">recruitment</a> app. There's a <a title="t.ly/28gnzHU" href="http://bit.ly/28gnzHU">testing automation</a> app. There's even a <a title="t.ly/1X7PyWl" href="http://bit.ly/1X7PyWl">CRM</a> app.</p><p></p><p>Check out the video and tell us what you think about the ServiceNow Store - what other apps you'd like to see, what new Store features you want.
