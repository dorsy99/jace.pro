<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="f81738c2dbdc57049c9ffb651f961933.iix" style="float: right" /><br />I have heard chatter for a little while that the ServiceNow Altiris 2.0 integration does not support the latest versions. It is true, see <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Altiris_Integration_2.0#Supported_Versions" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Altiris_Integration_2.0#Supported_Versions">http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Altiris_Integration_2.0#Supported_Versions</a>. The Altiris Integration 2.0 only supports up to V6.5. <br /><br />In a "previous life" I was an Altiris Admin and I had modified the OOB Altiris integration to support the updated version. However I never captured it as an update set so it could be shared with anyone. So a little while ago, I downloaded the trial version of Symantec Client Management Suite V7.1 and set out update the integration.<br /><br />I will prefix all of this with, this has not been tested in a large environment, as I only had a few devices on my home network to work with. Nor is this an official ServiceNow update to the Integration. Just me in my "man cave" trying to make the world a better place. :) However this will get you A LOT closer to what you want than starting with the OOB integration. I have included below a zip file with a couple documents. <br /><br />First: I created a Microsoft Word document that contains my notes on the Data Source differences OOTB vs, what I updated. Much of the time the table structure had changed in the Symantec CMDB. I tried to find the closest match. Sometimes Symantec added a view for what was previously there, or a new table etc. This document explains what I found and changed.<br /><br />Second: I have included the Update Set I created that will make these updates to the OOB Altiris 2.0 integration.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps. If you have any questions, let me know.<br /><br />&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br /> var _gaq = _gaq || [];<br /> _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-22945975-1']);<br /> _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);<br /><br /> (function() {<br /> var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;<br /> ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
