<p>As a ServiceNow administrator, one of the most common challenges is trying to find a particular script or configuration in your own instance. Whether you're troubleshooting or just trying to understand how something works, it would be very useful to be able to search scripts and configurations from the entire instance all at once. The problem is that there's no built-in solution to search all of your scripts and configurations which can leave you hunting through 20 or more tables to find what you're looking for.<br /><br />In order to solve this problem, Crossfuze Solutions and SNGuru developed the <a title="w.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/global-script-config-search/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/global-script-config-search/">Crossfuze Global Search</a>!<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/global-script-config-search/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CrossfuzeGlobalSearch-300x126.png" alt="Crossfuze Global Search" title="Crossfuze Global Search" width="300" height="126" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4464" /></a><br /><br /><a title="w.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/global-script-config-search/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/global-script-config-search/">Click here to read more and download</a></center><br /><!--break--></p>
