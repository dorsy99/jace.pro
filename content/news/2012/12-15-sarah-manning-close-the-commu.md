<p>Savvy IT organizations know that to be successful, continuous monitoring and coaching of process improvement must be embedded in organizational culture. That's why in 2013, leaders should work to brush the dust off their management methods and focus on Continuous Service Improvement, or CSI. Luckily, the <a title="um.com/2012/12/03/itsm-advances-set-to-empower-and-engage-users-in-2013" href="http://ovum.com/2012/12/03/itsm-advances-set-to-empower-and-engage-users-in-2013">newest vendor IT technologies</a> are starting to incorporate innovative ways to enable CSI within IT departments.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="personal-life-coaching.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="29a6f8c2dbdcd704ed6af3231f96192b.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p><a title="w.bruceelkin.com/images/personal-life-coaching.jpg" href="http://www.bruceelkin.com/images/personal-life-coaching.jpg">[image source]</a></p><p></p><p>The way this technology works is twofold: Through capabilities that enable tracking a specific behavior or activity, individuals receive real-time feedback on the quality of their work. Meanwhile, managers get insight on modifying processes and procedures to enhance team performance and drive IT transformation. </p><p></p><p>Through coaching loops:<br/>•<strong>Feedback abounds.</strong> Communication is key, and coaching loops enable clear pathways thereof. <br/>•<strong>Performance improves.</strong> Add together a culture of identifying and striving for improvements and a method for inspecting your existing processes, plus clear lines of communication, and you've got a recipe for success.<br/>•<strong>Outcomes impress.</strong> From the inside out, coaching loops help you work to positively influence the outcome of a process and set the bar high for consistency.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, IT departments can use technology to influence individuals towards a successful outcome. In the same way you coach a sports team to win, you can now drive your IT employees to perform——while simultaneously gaining critical process insights.</p><p></p><p>ServiceNow <a title="w.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,015495ac87967440a098183a2d434d54" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,015495ac87967440a098183a2d434d54">recently introduced coaching loops</a> to provide IT organizations with an automated, embedded approach to achieving CSI.
