<p>Thanks to all 114 who made out to OCLC last week for the Ohio SNUG meeting. Great day all around! Our sincere thanks to Maryville Technologies for sponsoring the meeting and to Matrix42 for Happy Hour sponsorship.<br /><br />The presentation slides are attached for all but the Gen2 hosting session and those are forthcoming. We appreciate the survey feedback and ideas you shared. We expect to offer meetings in Cleveland and Cincinnati in the November time-frame based on your comments and will allow time for more structured networking as you have requested. Stay tuned for more info on the next meetings.<br /><br />Reminder: K13 is scheduled for May 12 - 16, 2013 in Las Vegas. Is K13 in your 2013 budget? Gotta be! We look forward to seeing there as well our next local meetings.<br /><br />Thanks for being the best community of customers in all of IT!<br /><br />O H _ _ !</p>
