<p>Today at our LUG meeting we talked A LOT about SocialIT and its implications to IT, it's multiplier effect for the support analyst (more simultaneous interactions) and in particular a better user experience.<br /><br />Well, I was just sent a link to Chris Dancy's presentation "The Emergence of Social IT: Technology For The People". He was presenting this at the Nebraska HDI meeting while we were at our meeting. Here is the link:<br /><br />http://www.slideshare.net/chrisdancy/social-it-for-hdi-nebraska<br /><br />Enjoy!</p>
