<p>One area of Knowledge Management that is typically fairly confusing to new admins of the ServiceNow platform is the public (unauthenticated) security model. A 'Mark Public' UI button is displayed at the top of each knowledge article in its edit view. While clicking that button adds the 'public' role to the article, it doesn't actually do anything to make the article public! Unauthenticated users attempting to view the knowledge homepage, or an individual knowledge article will still be redirected to the ServiceNow login page. In reality, setting the 'public' role on a knowledge article does very little to impact the security of that article. Controlling public availability of Knowledge Base content can be easily accomplished if you know where to look!<br /><center><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/controlling-public-availability-knowledge-base-content/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PublicKB-300x95.png" alt="Public Knowledge Base" title="Public Knowledge Base" width="300" height="95" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4554" /></a><br /><br /><a title="w.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/controlling-public-availability-knowledge-base-content/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/controlling-public-availability-knowledge-base-content/">Read the full article at ServiceNow Guru...</a><br /></center><br /><!--break--></p>
