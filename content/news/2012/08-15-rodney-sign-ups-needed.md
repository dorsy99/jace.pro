The best place to do this is at our quarterly User Group Meetings, and we need all attendees to register for our upcoming event next week.<br /><br />Your registration is an important part of the LUG process for MANY reasons; so that we can continue to provide relevant content, attract guest speakers, and most important, order plenty of food!!<br /><br />If you haven't registered, PLEASE DO SO HERE: http://community.servicenow.com/oklahoma-user-group-3rd-quarter-meeting-cms-lab-edition<br /><br />Our updated agenda for the day is:<br /><br />8a - 10:00a : CMS Lab - Matt Beran (Maryville Technologies)<br /><br />10a - 10:40a : SN Customer: Kristy Howell (Williams)<br />10:40a - 11:10a : SN Discovery and Business Service Maps<br />11:10a - 11:20a : SN Runbook Automation, brief overview<br />11:20a â€” 12:00p : StartNow Methodology<br />12p - 12:45p : Lunch<br />12:45p - 1:15p : ServiceNow &amp; Mobility Options<br />1:15p - 2:00p Berlin Release Update &amp; Futures<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing everyone next week!</p></p>
