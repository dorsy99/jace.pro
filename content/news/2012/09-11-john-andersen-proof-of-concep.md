<p>I recently completed an Proof of Concept/Value integration between ServiceNow and CA's Service Operations Insight (SOI) product. <br /><br />The integration was designed to be a two-direction integration between ServiceNow's incident ticketing system and CA's Service Operations Insight (SOI) r3.0 application. It uses standard CA java JAR files that speak to SOI via web services from a MID Server.<br /><br />When an alert is created, modified, or cleared in CA's Service Operations Insight product, a ServiceNow ticket is created, updated, or closed respectively. When a ticket is created via an alert, the alert is modified with the ServiceNow incident number that corresponds with the alert. When the ticket is closed in ServiceNow, the corresponding alert is cleared in SOI.<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.john-james-andersen.com/wp-content/uploads/SOI-Arch-1.png"><img src="http://www.john-james-andersen.com/wp-content/uploads/SOI-Arch-1.png" alt="" title="SOI-Arch-1" width="600" /></a></center><br /><br />This integration uses a cool ServiceNow feature involving custom JAR files and MID Servers. You can load JAR files into a ServiceNow instance with the intent that those JAR files become installed and loaded into the MID Servers for the instance. The beauty of this is that when new MID Servers are installed, they automatically download and load the JAR files for use.<br /><br />You can check out the entire documentation for the integration, as well as download the update set by visiting the ServiceNow Wiki page for the <a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=CA_Service_Operations_Insight_%28SOI%29_POV" title="CA SOI Integration with ServiceNow" target="_blank">SOI Proof of Concept Integration with ServiceNow</a>.</p>
