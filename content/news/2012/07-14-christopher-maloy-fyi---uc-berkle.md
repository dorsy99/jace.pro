<p>I am not sure this is the right place to post this, but I took this class (not for a grade) just to listen to the lectures and there was a lot of good concepts that have helped me in using the SNC platform. <br /><br />I just recently gave a presentation about Unit Test in SNC and we are in the process of building a plugin to support TDD (Test Driven Development). I stole some of the concepts and ideas from this course. <br /><br />I ignored the Ruby part, but I found it useful to set up my own Amazon EC2 image. I use this now to do proof of concept integrations.<br /><br />Course information:<br />https://www.coursera.org/course/saas<br /><br />Amazon Web Services (this is free if you limit your usage and only use the basic configuration):<br />http://aws.amazon.com/</p>
