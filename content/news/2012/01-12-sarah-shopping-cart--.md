<p>I have a vague memory of seeing someone demo a feature at the MNLUG where the shopping cart widget would scroll down the screen on a Catalog Item that would need to scroll beyond one window. The idea was, if a customer had to scroll to complete the form, they wouldn't have to scroll back up to the top to "Add to Cart" or "Order Now." <br /><br />Wondering if anyone remembers this and could point me in the right direction - I'm fairly certain I didn't dream it up. :)<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer!</p>
