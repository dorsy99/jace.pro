<p>New Orleans is buzzing this week. <br /><br /><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DQo_50AWCgM/T7EYPtMpftI/AAAAAAAACxs/sEIzSwToLm4/s672/20120514_082703.jpg" /><br /><br /><a title="lus.google.com/105300838558555602864/posts/EP7xEXYuvkj" href="https://plus.google.com/105300838558555602864/posts/EP7xEXYuvkj">Not just the live music in the bars on Bourbon Street. Or the expansive riverfront of the Mississippi*. Or the amazing cars dotted around the city that makes the whole city look like a movie set.</a><br /><br />It's buzzing in the Hyatt hotel where ServiceNow customers and partners are amassing for Knowledge 12.<br /><br />Just walking through the hotel I'm bumping into people I have met on Twitter, seeing faces that I recognise from Live Feed. We are just starting day 2 of the pre-conference and you can just see that people are excited to be here.<br /><br />Driving up to the hotel from the airport the hotel just looks amazing in its "ServiceNow colours". The idea that we can fill a thousand room hotel and still have attendees staying across the town is mind blowing.<br /><br />The energy around the conference is almost tangible - you can actually feel it. You can also see the excitement in the <a title="witter.com/#!/search/%23know12" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23know12">#know12 Twitter stream.</a><br /><br />Over the past 8 days, 120 people and 320 tweets. <br /><br />Here's what we've been talking about: <br /><br /><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QNUcoP7e2r4/T7EcR5x1FmI/AAAAAAAACyk/8vF7CIaL48Y/s848/Screen+Shot+2012-05-14+at+14.58.30.png" /><br /><br />I love that <b>looking</b> and <b>forward</b> are weighted the same and so prominent. And that <b>happy days</b> is down in the bottom left.<br /><br />Here is a map of who's talking. Sorry for those who have underscores in their Twitter usernames (like me). Wordle doesn't like underscores so I stripped them out :(<br /><br /><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dy-3zt0LuxU/T7EcSVQLrCI/AAAAAAAACys/K1rU7aR0dAs/s831/Screen+Shot+2012-05-14+at+15.16.06.png" /><br /><br />You can see the <a title="witter.com/#!/servicenow/knowledge12-attendees" href="https://twitter.com/#!/servicenow/knowledge12-attendees">#know12 attendees twitter list</a> here - Tweet me <a title="itter.com/simo_morris" href="http://twitter.com/simo_morris">@simo_morris</a> if you want to be added to it<br /><br /><br />* Yes, I had to look up the spelling on Google.</p>
