<p>I was curious about a question someone asked on the Community about auto-expanding the stage field on the Order Status page for Service Catalog Requests, so I did a little digging and came up with a pretty simple solution that works quite well I believe.<br /><br />Step 1. open the "com.glideapp.servicecatalog_checkout_view" UI Page record<br />Step 2. Look for the following line of code: <pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br />&lt;g:inline template="item_workflow.xml"/&gt;</pre><br />Step 3. Add 3 lines of code to end up with:<!--break--><br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />&lt;g:inline template="item_workflow.xml"/&gt;<br />&lt;script&gt;<br />  togglePreference("$[sc_req_item.sys_id]");<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Now when your users submit an order the Stage field is automagically expanded to reveal all the stages:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="8e786502db901744e9737a9e0f961998.iix" style="width: 831px; height: auto;" /><br /><br /><br />As the page is created, the togglePreference() function is called for each item, expanding the stage field by default. It is currently running in <a title="emo10.service-now.com/" href="https://demo10.service-now.com/">demo10</a> at the moment.<br /><br /><strong>Reminder</strong>: modifying the out-of-box "com.glideapp.servicecatalog_checkout_view" UI Page means you will own it from now on, and you will not receive any automatic updates to it. I don't find it to be a big deal, as you can always grab the newest code, make your appropriate changes and save it again in your instances.</p>
