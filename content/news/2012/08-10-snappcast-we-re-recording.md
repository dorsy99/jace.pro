<p>We're recording today, so I'm putting a post out to get ideas and topics. We've gotten a couple emails that include topics like where to start with a CMDB, how to get started in the Content Management system, and how to get started on an implementation.<br /><br />If you have more suggestions, please provide comment or email, or tweet... basically if you can't get a hold of us it's your own fault.</p>
