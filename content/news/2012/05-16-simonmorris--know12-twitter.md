<p>Check out the Twitter buzz for day 1 of #know12.<br /><br />First of all - the Twitter search API isn't letting me pull back tweets based on volume so we only have a subset of the tweets sent today.<br /><br />Lesson 1 - 2,000 attendees exceed the number of tweets you are allowed to pull back from Twitter without a commercial agreement.<br /><br />The buzz today was:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="3de59d8edbd897049c9ffb651f961948.iix" /><br /><br /><ul><li>Debatable whether the reference to <b>Berlin</b> is the release or the man - there was a lot of talk about both today</li><li><b>CMDB</b> featured because of the excellent Panel session - we ran out of time for questions on that one.</li><li><b>CEO</b> featured after Franks keynote - but I wonder why "horse" didn't appear in the word cloud</li><li><b>Gamification</b> got a mention after <a title="itter.com/itilandme" href="http://twitter.com/itilandme">Michael Slabodnick</a> presented a breakout session on the subject</li><li><b>thenewguys</b> got a mention for being far to cheery and waving a lot all around the Expo floor</li><li>And of course, pretty happy to see <b>Coaching Loops</b> feature - if anyone wants a closer more coherent look at the tool just let me know</li></ul><br /><br />And here is who tweeted. Apologies for those with underscores in their Twitter names - consider yourself truncated.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="bc35b8c2db9c5f048c8ef4621f9619b0.iix" /><br /><br />Who think the top two words in tomorrows cloud will be <b>Bourbon</b> and <b>Street</b>?</p>
