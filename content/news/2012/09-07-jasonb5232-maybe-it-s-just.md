<p>Maybe it's because we've only been using Service Now for a couple weeks and haven't gotten into the weeds. Maybe it's because we still have a lot of immature processes and what we're asking the software to do is just trivial. <br /><br />Deploying new features, bug fixes, whatever, has just been so easy. Just hoping the other shoe never drops.</p>
