<p>The ServiceNow platform has been a hot topic today at Knowledge12 starting with Fred Luddy creating a flight-tracking app in about six minutes from the keynote stage. To quote Fred, "The ServiceNow platform allows regular people to create helpful apps." Some ServiceNow customers use the platform to consolidate disparate tools and workflow, and others use the platform to build innovative applications.<br /><br />Right now I'm witnessing this year's crop of innovative ServiceNow customers. I'm sitting in the Knowledge12 Innovation of the Year award finalist session and we just saw some very impressive applications. The best thing is you don't have to be at Knowledge12 to learn about the finalists or vote for the winner.<br /><br />Instructions to vote via text poll are provided at the end of this post. Here are summaries of the Innovation of the Year finalists for your consideration:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="e6ae8902db589f048c8ef4621f9619ee.iix" style="width: auto; height: 132px;" />KPN — self-service portal with gamification and embedded knowledge<br />•Created a completely new worker UI and end-user self service portal using the ServiceNow content management system;<br />•Added an end user incentive program (gamification) to stimulate the use of the portal and promote self service.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="b0d7648edb14dfc03eb27a9e0f961955.iix" style="width: auto; height: 115px;" />Morrison Foerster — Runbook Automation workflow to automate Windows7 migration<br />•Created Runbook Automation workflow to migrate 2500 users across 16 offices and 3 continents to Windows7;<br />•Automated timing for notifications, scheduled tasks for IT analysts, email archive export/imports, exchange migrations, custom dashboards, inbound email actions, and more.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="bff9c442db109fc068c1fb651f96190f.iix" style="width: auto; height: 135px;" />Pacific Life — location-based services based on floor plan overlays and heat maps<br />•Find user cubicle locations on any floor without having to open multiple applications from a PC or tablet;<br />•This also allows desktop support technicians to see the location of other users with cases open on the same floor.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="3a45e7bddbdc9f04e9737a9e0f961951.iix" style="width: auto; height: 114px;" />Swing Shift — band management for music, people and gigs<br />•Created a portal to manage music, gig calendar and people for an 18-piece jazz big band;<br />•Includes modules for charts (songs), chart lists, albums, individual members, jobs, rehearsals, set lists and venues.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="643b8d4adb5413043eb27a9e0f96195e.iix" style="width: auto; height: 108px;" />World Wide Technology — integrated deployment tool with error-checking workflow<br />•Created a way for deployment groups to perform automated code deployments for any type of deployment directly from ServiceNow;<br />•Currently includes automated code deployments for WebMethods, Salesforce.com, Oracle (database changes through OMM packages: DDL/PLSQL/etc), XML rules.<br /><br /><br />Now you know the Knowledge12 Innovation of the Finalists and it is up to you to pick the winner.<br /><br />Voting ends at midnight tonight, Knowledge12 time.
