Also thanks to George, Elizabeth and Brad from ServiceNow for providing access to Michael Malcangio, the new coffee mugs, and drinks and appetizers at J. Bucks!<br /><br />I am working to get copies of the slide decks soon and will post them here as once I have them. I also hope to talk further George and ServiceNow about options and guidelines for content and conversations and will use that, along with our discussions about potential topics, to post a poll to help shape the agenda for the next User Group meeting. Look for that shortly. <br /><br />It was great to meet so many of you and I hope to meet even more at the next meeting. Until then, if there is anything I can do to help create a great ServiceNow community, please don't hesitate to let me know.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Steven St. Germain <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/stevestgermain"><img src="http://www.linkedin.com/img/webpromo/btn_in_20x15.png" /></a></p>
