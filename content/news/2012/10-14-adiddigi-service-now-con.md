<p>Hello,<br /><br />I am happy to tell you, Service Now Control - "An add-on for Firefox, which attempts to make Maint on Service Now easy" is here. This add-on basically is taken from <a title="ef=" href="%3Ca%20href=">Firefox Add-on &amp; the magic number</a>"&gt; here  Thanks Garrick.<br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><br />I did some mods to the previous code, created an options page,and added some more features. Here are what this addon can do:<br /><ul><li><br />It provides you with a couple of options, to navigate to your instance , to go to your incident queue, to go to your task queue, to get your groups(this would be useful for configuring your groups in your "options" page of the add-on. Here is a snapshot :<br /><br /><img align="center" src="http://servicenowdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rightclick.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /></li><li><br />The next feature is, it lets you select a table name and the state associated with the table name, and gives the count of tickets that are still active in your name.<br /><br />This will be on the add-on bar. Once you hover your mouse on the bar, you will find the numbers of the latest 5 tickets.<br /><img align="centre" src="http://servicenowdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/status.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /></li><li><br />The next one is from the previous add-on, I just modified code so that I can code the rest of the features in the same .js file. The modification to the code was to handle it as an object(it was plain old Javascript before)<br /><br />You can select a piece of text and navigate to that CMDB/Knowledge/user/Incident record<br /><br /><img align="centre" src="http://servicenowdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/comment.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /></li><li><br />The last one, will notify you if there is an Incident raised, and assigned to your group, and it s assigned_to is unfilled. i.e. the Incident is still not assigned to anyone from your group. You can assign it to yourself! By clicking on that notification popup, it navigates to the incident record, where you can fill in the assigned_to and save the record.<br /><br /><img align="centre" src="http://servicenowdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/incident.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br />That summarizes the features.<br /><br /> <b>To Do's</b><br /><br /><ul><li>Borrow the features from Simmon Morris's chrome extension and implement the same for Firefox.</li><li>Create different options depending on the role of the user logging - Thanks for the idea Arun Praveen.</li></ul><br /><br />I am not able to attach the XPI file here, I have given the links to the xpi, and a rough instruction sheet here : http://servicenowdiary.com/service-now-control-v-02/<br /><br /><br />This is my first add-on, so please forgive me if you encounters any blunders in the code. Please take time to update it in the tracker here :<br />http://code.google.com/p/service-now-control-v02/issues/list<br /><br />Also, Please suggest an Image, or the design of an Image that i can use for this Add-on.I'm running out of ideas on this one! :)<br /><br />Thanks! Hope you will like it !</li></ul></p>
