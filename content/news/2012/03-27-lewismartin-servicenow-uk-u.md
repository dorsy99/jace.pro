<p>Plans are really coming together for the 2nd birthday celebration user group event on Thursday 24th May.<br /> <br />The event is being held at Glaziers Hall, near London Bridge, and is sponsored by Team Ultra.<br /> <br />Details will follow in the next few weeks, with exciting changes to the agenda/format and a special guest speaker! The next update will also include details on how to register your place.<br /> <br />Past events have been over subscribed and we have had to turn people away. Something I've not liked doing! So I'm really pleased that Team Ultra have agreed to support a larger event.<br /> <br />Please note the date in your diary's and look out for the next announcement.</p>
