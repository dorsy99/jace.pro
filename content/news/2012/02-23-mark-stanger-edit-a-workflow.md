<p>A couple of weeks ago, I saw a great idea from Alex Yupanqui, who works for ServiceNow, to create UI actions to allow users to directly edit a graphical workflow from the associated record. I've taken this idea and cleaned things up a bit to make it usable and secure throughout the system.<br /><br />You're probably already familiar with the 'Show Workflow' and 'Workflow Context' UI action links that show up on task records when a workflow gets associated to it. These UI actions are extremely useful for identifying the state of the workflow as it relates to the task. As an administrator or consultant, you're often trying to troubleshoot or fix an issue with the workflow, which requires the workflow editor. Unfortunately, this means you have to navigate to the module in the left nav and try to find the correct workflow to edit. The purpose of this solution is to cut out all of those extra steps to allow you to edit the workflow directly from the record it is bound to.<br /><center><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-actions-system-ui/edit-workflow-ui-action/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/EditWorkflow-300x209.jpg" alt="Edit Workflow" title="Edit Workflow" width="300" height="209" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4304" /></a><br /><br /><a title="w.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-actions-system-ui/edit-workflow-ui-action/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-actions-system-ui/edit-workflow-ui-action/">Click here</a> to read more!<br /></center><br /><!--break--></p>
