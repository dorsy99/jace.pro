<p>As I mentioned in a previous post, our team picked up a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.cedma.org/resources/Docuworks/file_display.cfm?id=2315" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">national award</a> within the training industry at the annual CEdMA conference where companies like HP, BMC, Apple, and Salesforce.com were all in attendance.<br/><br/>This past week at our annual sales conference, our team picked up an internal award for innovation where we were recognized for bringing our implementation certification program to market in record time (&lt;6 weeks).</p><p><br/><a href="http://i782.photobucket.com/albums/yy104/onegaucho/sn-award.png"><img src="http://i782.photobucket.com/albums/yy104/onegaucho/sn-award.png"/></a><br/><br/>I don't have a lot of communication with customers and partners through this medium (nor do I via my twitter feed <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/techtrainingtip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@techtrainingtip</a>) but I thought I'd try to solicit some feedback here to see what else our customers and our partners would like to see from ServiceNow as far as training deliverables.<br/><br/>Our <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.servicenow.com/blog/andyho/servicenow-education-services-team-introduces-process-user-training-program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">process user and end user training program</a> has been a popular request lately but I'm wondering what types of issues are in the field that customers most want us to address through formal (or informal) training.</p>
