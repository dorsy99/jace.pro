<p>Last month, I was in attendance at a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://cedma.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CEdMA</a> conference to be a panelist on the topic of blending learning solutions. A big surprise was that our <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.service-now.com/training.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Education Services team at ServiceNow</a> won the annual "IMPACT" award from the committee, awarded to the team or individual that had the greatest impact on their organization the previous year. This is a high honor considering most of the technology companies in the Silicon Valley are part of this organization.<br/><br/>I turned in a 10-page application that outlined how our team grew from 1 to 17 people in an 18-month span as well as go from a cost center to a profit center incorporating all kinds of innovative features into our course curriculum.<br/><br/>We're continuing to introduce new training programs to the field and one of our newest offerings will be centered around process user training. Stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks!<br/><br/>To learn more about the impact award, click <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.cedma.org/resources/Docuworks/file_display.cfm?id=2315" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to read the press release of our win.</p>
