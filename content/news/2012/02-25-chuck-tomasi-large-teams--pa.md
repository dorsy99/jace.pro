<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="97d4550adb981b04ed6af3231f96190a.iix" align="right" />For the past year or so I've been working with large customers with large deployment teams. This differs greatly from when I was a customer with a team of two people configuring the platform. As a result, I've learned a few things in the past few months. In this series, I'll cover some of the things I've learned from working in a larger team. Feel free to add comments and share your contributions.<br /><!--break--><br /><br />One of the first things we ran into on a large team was sending debug messages to the screen. It can be a bit challenging when dealing with a hierarchical system such as ServiceNow. For example, someone puts a <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideSystem#addInfoMessage.28Object.29" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideSystem#addInfoMessage.28Object.29">gs.addInfoMessage()</a> call in a business rule that runs on the task table and that business rule is inherited. Now when I'm working on change, I see blue messages appear at the top of the screen with 10 cryptic messages like "i=3 true". Where did that come from?! And I've got a demo in 10 minutes to show off my new screen format.<br /><br />If you're going to be debugging in a team environment, try using <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideSystem#log.28String_message.2C_String_source.29" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideSystem#log.28String_message.2C_String_source.29">gs.log()</a> on your sever side scripts. Output ends up in System Logs&gt; Script Log Statements. My preference is to make the logs messages as easy to filter as possible. Here are some ideas to make it easier to filter what I see in the script log:<br /><br /><ol><li>Option 1: Use the "source" argument in gs.log() to create your own source based on your name, or the item you are debugging. For example, gs.log('Result=' + result, 'incident'); No, you won't be able to find them in the System Logs&gt; Script Log Statements (because that module is defined to look for source '*** Script'), but you can create your own module or filter to get just your messages.</li><li>Option 2: Add meaningful information in the text of your gs.log() statements to set them apart. My personal choice is to start all my debug messages with "&gt;&gt;&gt;DEBUG", it's easy to spot and filter on. Depending on the situation, I also add the script name and perhaps the function (in script includes) so I know exactly where the message is coming from. Note: If you look at the debug outputs, they don't always show up in the exact order they were executed. Run a for-loop and log the counter to the log some time.</li><li>Option 3: Sure, in the example above, writing <pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br />gs.log('&gt;&gt;&gt;DEBUG: myChangeTaskFunctions: loadNextTask():…')</pre>as a prefix every time is kind of annoying if you have to do it 20 times. And when you're done, going back to comment them all out is also a pain! For script includes, try creating a private _debug() method something like this:<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />  initialize : function() {<br /><br />    this.debug = true;<br />    this.debugPrefix = '&gt;&gt;&gt;DEBUG: myChangeTaskFunctions:';<br />  },<br /><br />  _debug : function (s) {<br /><br />     if (this.debug)<br />       gs.log(this.debugPrefix + ' ' +s);<br />  }<br /></pre><br /><br />The property <pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br />this.debug</pre>determines if anything will be output in the _debug() method, and the property <pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br />this.debugPrefix</pre>saves lots of typing while giving consistent information to your debug output.<br /><p><br />Now you can sprinkle debug statements throughout your script like this:<br /></p><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br />this._debug('loadNextTask(): querying table…');</pre><br /></li></ol><br />When you want to turn all the debug statements off in that script include, just go to initialize() and set this.debug=false.<br /><ul class="noindent"><li>For Business Rules, use a local variable with your debug prefix, such as:<br /></li></ul><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />allMyCircuits();<br /><br />function allMyCircuits() {<br />  var dPref = '&gt;&gt;&gt;DEBUG: BR: All My Circuits ' + current.number + ' ';<br />  gs.log(dPref + 'starting the function');<br />}<br /></pre><br />It's fairly trivial to use a gs.log() call and get useful information to filter on. One final note, I included the name of the business rule in the log. I often forget to turn off those debug messages after development is done. Months later I find them cluttering up the log. It's nice to know where they are coming from!<br /><br /><br />Reference:<br /><a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideSystem#log.28String_message.2C_String_source.29" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideSystem#log.28String_message.2C_String_source.29">gs.log()</a></p>
