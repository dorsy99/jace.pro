<p>I've always thought it was strange that there was a "Modules with Role" related list on the Role form, but not one for Applications, so I figured it was time to add one. This is how you do it:<br /><br />1. Create a new Relationship record (System Definition \ Relationships)<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="501285c6dbd097049c9ffb651f961971.iix" /><br /><!--break--><br /><br />2. Personalize the Role form by adding the new "Applications with Roles" related list. Now you'll have an always up-to-date list of the applications which are restricted to that particular role:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="714f544edb985344e9737a9e0f9619dc.iix" /></p>
