<p>Hey all,<br /><br />Here is a link to a video I recently did on how to use the Unit Test Update Set I provided last blog post. I am going to ask forgiveness in advance for my lack of celebrity quality. It is 10 mins long. I hope you enjoy. Cheers.<br /><br />PS - I am also reattaching the update set I used in this video as well.<br /><br /><a title="imeo.com/48385032" href="https://vimeo.com/48385032">Link to video</a><br />https://vimeo.com/48385032</p>
