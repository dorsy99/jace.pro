<p>This script in this post is completely coded,tested by my best buddy Ishaq. I am just sharing it :)<br /><br />Many a time you would want to just get the names of files present in a Particular shell of an FTP.. The code below will get you all the names of files in an Array List. You could choose to use any other collection object depending on what exactly you want to do.<br /><br /><b><a title="rvicenowdiary.com/2012/06/get-names-files-ftp/" href="http://servicenowdiary.com/2012/06/get-names-files-ftp/">Get the File names in an FTP Location</a></b></p>
