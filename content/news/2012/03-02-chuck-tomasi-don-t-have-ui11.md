<p>I love UI11. One of my favorite features is that wonderful edge on the left to quickly navigate through the system the favorite items that I choose.

Watch the video below for step by step instructions to create labels and easily navigate to make yourself a toolbox of items from lists, modules, and test records.<br /><!--break--><br />(Watch full screen for best results)<br /><center><br /><embed width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dhqkmbMX68I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></embed><br /></center></p>
