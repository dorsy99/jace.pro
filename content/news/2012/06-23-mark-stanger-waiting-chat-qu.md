<p>Just the other day I came across an issue with a client that came up with a couple of users on the ServiceNow forums as well. The issue was that technicians monitoring a chat queue had no way of knowing that a chat was waiting unless they were staring at their chat desktop the entire time. Since most IT people tend to multitask, this can become a problem resulting in longer-than-ideal wait times in the chat queue.<br />With the help of the ServiceNow Guru 'Module Counts' update set I was able to find a solution that I think effectively solves this issue by showing a count in the left navigation pane whenever a new chat enters a user's queue.<br /><center><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/waiting-chat-queue-entries-notification/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WaitingChatQueueSolution-300x82.png" alt="Waiting Chat Queue Solution" title="Waiting Chat Queue Solution" width="300" height="82" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4495" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/waiting-chat-queue-entries-notification/" target="_blank"><b>Click here to read more!</b></a><br /></center><br /><!--break--></p>
