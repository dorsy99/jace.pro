<p>I have not used IE as my web browser for years now, but I still use it every work day. I prefer to use Chrome, but there is one feature in IE that I find indispensable - script debugging. Because most of my clients use IE as their approved standard, I use IE for final testing, but with a twist - I uncheck the "Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)" option under the Advanced tab of the Internet Options dialog:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="bd811c0adbd417049c9ffb651f9619d9.iix" style="width: 445px; height: auto;" /><br /><br /><br />With that option disabled, IE will now alert me whenever it encounters a scripting error:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="88bfebb5db589b048c8ef4621f961992.iix" style="width: 470px; height: auto;" /><br /><br /><br />...and if I click on the "Yes" button, will bring me right to the problem code:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="fe85e10adb105b04ed6af3231f9619ad.iix" style="width: 554px; height: auto;" /><br /><br /><br />Now I can search for the offending text in my scripts and fix it quite easily. This is very useful because any script error will stop all subsequent scripts from running, including UI Policies. So you may notice that a UI Policy is not acting properly and you would start to investigate why, but all along it is actually a script error that caused everything else to stop running. This can definitely save you a lot of time and headache.<br /><br />I've tried a couple Chrome extensions, but this just seems to work the best for me.</p>
