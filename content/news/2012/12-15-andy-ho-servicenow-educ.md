<p>The ServiceNow Education Services team recently introduced a new way for our customers to purchase training. Click <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,c417877f879d704093db7b2d7d434dac" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to see the official details posted to our corporate site. I thought I would take a few minutes to provide additional Q&amp;A:<br/><br/><strong>Q: First of all, do you know what a learning credit is? And how does it different from how I currently pay for training?</strong><br/>A: Learning credits adhere to a "pay now and use later" philosophy. You can still purchase training when you need it but this is more like buying a gift card to a store for a friend. They can use it whenever they need to.<br/><br/><strong>Q: How much is each learning credit worth?</strong><br/>A: $500. Discounts can apply if you buy more than a certain amount ($25k and above).<br/><br/><strong>Q: Do they have an expiration date?</strong><br/>A: Yes. 12 months from the date that you purchase them.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Why would I purchase learning credits?</strong><br/>A: If you are given a set budget for a given fiscal year and need to spend it or else you lose it, this is an ideal way to spend those funds and defer the training to a point in time within the next year when you'll need them.<br/><br/><strong>Q: I have more questions about this program. Who can I contact?</strong><br/>A: Contact your ServiceNow sales rep or alternatively, send an email to us at <a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:training@servicenow.com">training@servicenow.com</a> and we'll get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
