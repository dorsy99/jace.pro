<p>Greetings from Knowledge12 in New Orleans! I'll be here all week with CrossFuze Solutions so if you're here and see me, please introduce yourself. I'm looking forward to putting a face to all of the names of people I've worked with remotely.<br /><br />I'm working with a client currently who wants to encourage the use of their Knowledge Base to reduce their ticket load. This, of course, is a common requirement but it's one that I don't think is adequately addressed in ServiceNow currently. In this post I'll share my implementation of their idea. I don't think it's a perfect solution, but it might give you some ideas to improve your own process and design. This post shows how you can force a KB search using the standard search dialog whenever a user creates an incident. I've designed the solution to work in a standard incident form and within the service catalog so that it can be applied in whatever way you create tickets in your environment. <br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/mandatory-knowledge-search-ticket-creation/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AutoKBPopup-300x152.png" alt="Automatic KB Popup" title="Automatic KB Popup" width="300" height="152" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4406" /></a><br /><br /><h3><a title="w.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/mandatory-knowledge-search-ticket-creation/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/mandatory-knowledge-search-ticket-creation/">Read more at ServiceNow Guru!</a></h3></center><br /><!--break--></p>
