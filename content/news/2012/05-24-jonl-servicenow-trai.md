<p>I'm really proud to announce the training team has won a leading industry award from our peers. CEdMA (Computer Education Managers Association) is the premier organization for training executives representing over 100 high tech companies. The CEdMA Impact Award seeks to recognize a company who demonstrates excellence both in the impact they and their organization have, as well as their ability to clearly prove that impact. <br/><br/>Wow!</p>
