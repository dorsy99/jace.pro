<p>Thanks to everyone for attending the first OK Service Now LUG!! By the amount of questions and great conversation, it seemed like a good time was had by all.<br /><br />A special THANK YOU to Kristy H. for organizing everything and being the perfect hostess.<br /><br />As promised, here is the listing of items that we would like to cover in the next meeting during our newest stop of the TOLA-palooza: TULSA!<br /><br />- Opening pre-LUG Lab (Option 1: CMS, Option 2: Workflow)<br />- Customer Presentations (Williams to lead, but we will take others too)<br />- Fruition Partners: Twilio Integration and "Gamification" using the SN platform<br />- CMDB: Best practices and getting started in enterprise cmdb<br /><br />That is what I captured as priorities, but we also had SWAM, Reporting, Training &amp; Certification and Data Certification. We can keep those for the fall meeting/holiday party!!<br /><br />Thanks everyone, and please remember to post to our User Group on a regular basis to keep things fresh and interesting for all involved.<br /><br />If you have any ?'s or !'s, I can always be reached at rodney.runolfson@service-now.com.<br /><br />Have a great day and a better week ahead!</p>
