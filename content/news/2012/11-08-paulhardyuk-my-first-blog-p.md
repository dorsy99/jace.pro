<p>Hello there!<br /><br />Firstly I feel somewhat honoured to have been invited to have my own blog page here in the community. I say this as I am neither a ServiceNow employee or a partner, but in fact a customer and a user of the ServiceNow Platform.<br /><br />In my current role as the Director of ITSM at <a title="w.informa.com" href="http://www.informa.com">Informa Plc.</a> I am an adviser to group CIO, regional IT leadership teams and business executives for IT Service Management. I am responsible for implementing successful service delivery methodologies and processes utilising our regional IT resources. For the last 2 years I have enjoyed the successes we have experienced working with the ServiceNow platform. Some of which I will share here soon!<br /><br /><i>"Informa provides academics, businesses and individuals with unparalleled knowledge, up-to-the minute information and highly specialist skills and services. With around 8,500 employees working in some 150 offices in over 40 countries, our global reach and breadth of offer is unique"</i> <a title="w.informa.com" href="http://www.informa.com">www.informa.com</a><br /><br />I'm also involved in Supplier and Business Relationship Management, Communication and Collaboration, Surfing and Skateboarding, so if you're in London, UK and fancy a beer, give me a shout!<br /><br />Until next time...<br /><br /><b>Paul Hardy</b><br /><a title="w.twitter.com/paulhardyuk" href="http://www.twitter.com/paulhardyuk">Twitter</a> | <a title="w.linkedin.com/in/paulhardyuk" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulhardyuk">LinkedIn</a></p>
