<p>Well, I've been in San Diego this past week for the Implementation Bootcamp training, and now that it is getting close for me to head back home, I'm wondering if I really should just stay here instead:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="81efbf3ddb541304b322f4621f961989.iix" /><br /><br />Thanks a lot to Sean, Paul and everyone else here at ServiceNow. It's been great getting to know more ServiceNow employees and partners. This has been my best class ever (this week).<br /><br />I think the weather forecast pretty much sums it up for ServiceNow's future as well!!!</p>
