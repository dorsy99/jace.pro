<p>OK,<br /><br />I wasn't really tired tonight, so I stayed up and wrote a plugin that does outbound ReST calls. I modeled this outbound ReST functionality after what our development teams did for outbound SOAP messages. Attached are some screen shots of what it looks like. I tried to attach the update set as well, but this community blog didn't allow me to upload an XML file.<br /><br />More information to come. Please take a look at the screen shots until I can get my update set hosted. Cheers and happy coding.</p>
