<p>A customer came to me with a rather interesting request. At first it appeared as a simple <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title&#61;Database_Views" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title&#61;Database_Views" rel="nofollow">database view</a>, but they wanted a few extras thrown in that provided me with a learning opportunity I just had to share with you. If you haven&#39;t used database views before, they&#39;re a cool way to merge information from two (or more) different tables in to one &#34;virtual table&#34;, or view. You can then use them just like any other table to generate reports, gauges, etc. The challenge for me was in the filtering of a left join - watch the video and see what happened.<br /><br />(view full screen for best results)<br /><br /></p>
