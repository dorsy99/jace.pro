<p>Pre-conference training kicked off today in New Orleans at our annual users event. <br/><br/>Some facts from our first day:<br/>- Over 450 students registered and attended<br/>- 16 classrooms<br/>- 6 different courses offered<br/>- 33 staff instructors available to teach and assist students<br/><br/>The Hyatt is one of New Orleans' last structures to get rebuilt after Katrina so many of the amenities and features of the hotel are very modern. There are YouTube videos posted on how to navigate through their "hi-tech" elevators. It's also one of the most expansive hotels I've ever stayed in. In a normal day at the office, I'll have walked 3,000-4,000 steps by 5 PM. Today, I hit 3,000 by 8:45 AM and as I got back to my hotel room (6:15 PM) my pedometer reads 10,830. <br/><br/>I love customer events because you get to meet some really cool people who love our product. When I reviewed our rosters, I saw that we had students coming in from South Africa - Cape Town to be specific. Having taught classes there in a previous life (with one of our competitors) I was eager to meet them. During lunch, I sat down at a table and introduced myself to the 4 people sitting on the other end... who were from the University of Cape Town! Needless to say, they were still a little jet lagged from their flight but very excited to be a part of the conference.<br/><br/>Can't wait to meet more customers in the coming days!<br/><br/></p><p><strong><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.service-now.com/users/andyho" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Andy Ho</a></strong>, <strong>Curriculum Manager</strong> | ServiceNow | <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.service-now.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.service-now.com</a><br/><br/><br/>Transform IT<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.service-now.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="ServiceNow" border="0" height="37" src="http://community.service-now.com/files/shared/servicenow-logo.png" vspace="8" width="150"/></a></p>
