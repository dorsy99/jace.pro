<p>It was bound to happen sooner or later... you are diligently updating your Incident, you hit <b>Submit</b> and then realise you were writing in the Comments field rather than the Worknotes<br /><br /><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2250/2192192956_c9023211ca.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="/doh" /><br /><br /><h2>D'oh</h2><br /><br />Comments are visible to customers, Work Notes are visible internally. Whilst we are all far too professional to write anything snarky about our customers in the WorkNotes you might sometimes annotate information that is better kept internal.<br /><br />If one of your ITIL users accidentally updates the Comments instead of WorkNotes don't panic.. Here is how to fix it<br /><br />1. Get the sys_id of the record that was accidentally updated. Right click the form header and <b>Copy sys_id</b><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="4249e486db54dfc068c1fb651f961983.iix" /><br /><br />2. Head over to the <b>sys_journal_field</b> table. We don't show this in the Application Navigator by default so type <b>sys_journal_field.list</b> into the Filter Text.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="209a4ccedb509704ed6af3231f961965.iix" /><br /><br />3. From there you can build a filter to find the journal entry you want to edit (or delete)<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="aee7a37ddb181704ed6af3231f9619c9.iix" /><br /><br />Using the Element ID field (the sys_id you copied just now) and the Created By date it should be easy to find the right entry.<br /><br />You could either edit the Element field to change the entry to a WorkNote (rather than a comment) or delete it.<br /><br />4. If you have a lot of records with a lot of journal entries you might find this easier to do in Background Scripts<br /><br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />var gr = new GlideRecord('sys_journal_field');<br />gr.addQuery('element', 'comments');<br />gr.addQuery('element_id', '46f09e75a9fe198100f4ffd8d366d17b'); // sys_id of the Incident record<br />gr.query();<br /><br />while (gr.next() ) {<br /><br />   gs.print("sys_id=" + gr.sys_id + "  comment=" + gr.value);<br /><br />}<br /><br />// When you are happy use gr.get('sys_id_of_journal_entry') and change the element to make it a worknote<br /><br /></pre><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/striatic/2192192956/" title="/doh by striatic, on Flickr">Image Credit</a></p>
