<p>The ability to associate Affected Configuration Items against a task is one of the most basic pieces of the various task forms in ServiceNow. ServiceNow gives you the 'Configuration Item' field to associate a single CI and the 'Affected CIs' related list in the event that your task needs to be associated to multiple CIs. I've written before about the <a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/cmdb/track-affected-cis-one-place/" title="Track Affected CIs in One Place">benefits of tracking all of this information in one place</a> to simplify reporting and usage requirements. During an onsite visit with a customer this week I noticed another opportunity to improve the functionality of the 'Affected CIs' related list. It would be very useful to be able to right-click items in the 'Affected CIs' related list and show a BSM Map or associated tasks just like you can do for the 'Configuration Item' field UI Macro icons. This post will show you how you can set these list context UI Actions up in your instances.<br /><center><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-actions-system-ui/show-bsm-ci-map-affected-cis-related-list/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/CIRefIcons-300x168.jpg" alt="Configuration Item Reference Icons" title="Configuration Item Reference Icons" width="300" height="168" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4258" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-actions-system-ui/show-bsm-ci-map-affected-cis-related-list/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/CIContextActions-300x231.jpg" alt="Configuration Item Context Actions" title="Configuration Item Context Actions" width="300" height="231" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4259" /></a><br /></center><br /><br />http://snguru.com/system-ui/ui-actions-system-ui/show-bsm-ci-map-affected-cis-related-list/<br /><!--break--></p>
