<p>If you've worked with the ServiceNow platform for more than 15 minutes you already know how easy it is to <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Creating_a_Custom_Table" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Creating_a_Custom_Table">create new tables</a> and <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Personalizing_Forms" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Personalizing_Forms">define form/list layouts</a>. It's almost as fast to build an application and setup the forms as it is to draw the design concepts.<br /><!--break--><br />Now that I'm in Product Management I'm responsible for generating more application and UI concepts. I'm still a developer at heart so I usually lean toward just building a quick application to demonstrate concepts, especially if it's based on existing UI element. The problem with this approach is that I start thinking like a developer, trying to add logic and make things work since I'm already in the platform. To prevent this possible time-sink from consuming precious hours from my day I've decided to stick with an external tool for generating application mockup images. Since I already use OmniGraffle for other documentation I created a stencil with the common ServiceNow elements to help build mockups quickly.<br />It's published on <a title="affletopia.com/stencils/870" href="http://graffletopia.com/stencils/870">Graffletopia</a>. Feel free to provide feedback since I'll most likely be updating the published stencil as I find things that I forgot or new elements that we create.</p>
