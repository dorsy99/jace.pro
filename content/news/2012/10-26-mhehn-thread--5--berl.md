<p>If you are already on Berlin and found something others may want to know, please let us all know.<br />Please ignore issues regarding Berlin, that's a different thread. This one is about reasons to go for Berlin.<br /><br />By the way: this is one of the threads ServiceNow employees are explicitely encouraged to provide input.
