<p><p>I work at a medium sized midwestern software development company. We continually increases revenue by 50% a year after year. We grow at a rate that requires the company to grow up quickly and we haven't always grown up in the right spots. Everyone just comes into work with their cowboy hat on planning on being a hero. Eventually, things start to slip through the cracks and somebody goes CRAP! This doesn't scale! We need some sort of process!</p><br /><br /><p>Where to begin? Let's start with the Service Desk. Let's get Service Now, ITIL best practices are just laid out in front of you. The tool will do anything. We're on our way.</p><br /><br /><p>Hey, what about putting SDLC and Project Management into Service Now? Let's go! Oh yeah, we don't have any standard for how we management projects.</p><br /><br /><p>So here we go on our journey into creating a PMO at the same as we create a Project Management tool that works for us. I see this as being good and bad. What makes sense now may not make sense 6 months from now. That's part of the reason I'm writing this.</p><br /><br /><ol><li>Help myself remember where we started at</li><li>Possibly help others figure it more quickly</li><li>Get comments about how other people are using the Project &amp; SDLC modules</li></ol><br /><br /><!-- Project module just isn't as mature as the rest of the product. --><br /><br /><!-- What approach should we take put everything in forms or use Managed Documents --><br /><br /><!-- Really have two goals one is organzation process assets and the other is scheduling --></p>
