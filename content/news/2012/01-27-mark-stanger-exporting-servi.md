<p>This post comes in response to a request I received from some of my colleagues at ServiceNow to be able to export a catalog item definition to XML and transport it between instances. I've written before about how you can quckly <a title="w.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/imports/simple-power-xml-export-import/" href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/imports/simple-power-xml-export-import/" target="_blank">export and import data between ServiceNow instances using the XML export/import context menus</a>. While this works great for a lot of situations, it doesn't work so great for data that resides in multiple tables, but really makes sense to be exported as a single unit. The components that make up a Catalog item definition are actually stored in over 21 separate tables! It is possible to export a catalog item but you have to do at least 21 separate exports to do it. In this post, I'll show you how you can set up a UI action to export information from all 21+ tables that make up a catalog item definition...in one click!<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/exporting-service-catalog-items-step/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ExportCatalogItem-300x227.jpg" alt="Export Catalog Item" title="Export Catalog Item" width="300" height="227" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4281" /></a></center><br /><br />http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/exporting-service-catalog-items-step/<br /><!--break--></p>
