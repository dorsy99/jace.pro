<p>Just a quick scripting tip today based on a solution that I helped someone with on the ServiceNow community site. The request I received was to be able to change the form header background color based on changes to values in a record. You're probably aware that ServiceNow provides a global CSS property to set the form and list header color. This is usually one of the first things that gets customized during a deployment. The global property can be found by navigating to System Properties -&gt; CSS, and changing the 'Banner and list caption background color' property.<br /><br />This request required something more dynamic so that the color could change based on specific table and record values and specific changes to a specific form. In order to accomplish this, I came up with a simple client script that can be used anywhere you need it.<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/change-form-header-background-color/"><img src="http://www.servicenowguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/FormHeaderColorChange-300x210.jpg" alt="Form Header Color Change" title="Form Header Color Change" width="300" height="210" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4242" /></a></center><br /><br />http://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/client-scripts-scripting/change-form-header-background-color/<br /><!--break--></p>
