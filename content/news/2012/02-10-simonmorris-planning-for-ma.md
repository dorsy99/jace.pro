<p>Over at <a href="http://www.theitsmreview.com/2012/02/planning-major-incidents/"><b>"The ITSM Review"</b> I talk about Major Incident planning</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jf01350/5694915773/" title="Car Crash A2 Rochester 07/05/2011 by jf01350, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2238/5694915773_161c68390f.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Car Crash A2 Rochester 07/05/2011" /></a><br /><br />The topic came up during a conversation with a customer about the best way to handle Major Incidents. We agreed that it doesn't require a massive change to the standard model for handling Incidents, but communication is the key.<br /><br />Short excerpt below and head over to <a title="w.theitsmreview.com/2012/02/planning-major-incidents/" href="http://www.theitsmreview.com/2012/02/planning-major-incidents/">the ITSM Review</a> for the full article.<br /><br /><blockquote><br />Recently I've been working on Incident Management, and specifically on Major Incident planning.<br /><br />During my time in IT Operations I saw teams handle Major Incidents in a number of different ways. I actually found that in some cases all process and procedure went out of the window during a Major Incident, which has a horrible irony about it. Logically it would seem that this is the time that applying more process to the situation would help, especially in the area of communications.<br /><br />For example in an organisation I worked in previously we had a run of Storage Area Network outages. The first couple caused absolute mayhem and I could see people pushing back against the idea of breaking out the process-book because all that mattered was finding the technical fix and getting the storage back up and running.<br /><br />At the end of the Incident, once we'd restored the service we found that we, maybe unsurprisingly had a lot of unhappy customers! Our retrospective on that Incident showed us that taking just a short time at the beginning of the outage to sort out our communications plan would have helped the users a lot.<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jf01350/5694915773/" title="Car Crash A2 Rochester 07/05/2011 by jf01350, on Flickr">Image credit</a></p>
