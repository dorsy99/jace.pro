<p>I am onsite working with a customer using the latest Berlin release. We had to build out a RBA workflow that uses the new REST libraries and functionality. Let me first say how powerful, dynamic, and amazing it is to be able to make a REST call (as defined by this customer) via a mid server and create a ticket in their current HPSM system. <br /><br />The point of that long intro is to mention we did run into one issue the community should know about. If you are using variable replacement in a URL and your variable has a space, the current libraries do NOT escape spaces. You can not have spaces in a URL, so either manually use %20 or change the RestMessage ScriptInclude to escape spaces when they are used in the URL.<br /><br />That is all I have for you today. I finally have 5 min to write.<br /><br />This is how you can fix it in the script include:<br />There is a script include called RESTMessage. If you open it up and find the method _handleParameters, change the line that starts with param.value =â€¦ to:<br /> <pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /> param.value = '' + Packages.com.glide.util.StringUtil.urlEncode(value);</pre><br /><br />It should be line 362 I believe. That should substitute the space with a + and other special characters to their 3 byte values.</p>
