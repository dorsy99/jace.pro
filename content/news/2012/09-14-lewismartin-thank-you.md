<p>A big thank you to all the customers who attended the user group yesterday. Without you it would not be possible to have these events. I hope you all got alot from the day and you will be sending all your feedback.<br /><br />Many thanks to Partners in IT who sponsored the event and found a wonderful location. Talking and Dancing robots is hard to beat!!!<br /><br />Many thanks to David Bailey from Brother who gave a really good customer presentation and the feedback after was that it really hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />Also, many thanks to the presenters from Partners in IT and ServiceNow who gave up thier time, and for one, travelling over night from the US to attend and speak with everyone.<br /><br />Heres to the next event.</p>
