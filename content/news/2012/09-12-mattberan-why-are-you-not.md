<p>I'm trying to figure out why so many people aren't using mobile for ServiceNow. I can create a poll for this, but I'd rather just hear unfiltered comments.<br /><br />Can you comment here, or send me an email: mattberan @gmail<br /><br /><b>UPDATE: Actually, there is a poll: http://community.servicenow.com/poll/13031</b></p>
