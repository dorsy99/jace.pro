<p>This thread is about legacy interfaces you implemented, meaning all those interfaces that aren't just configured in ServiceNow, but rather require implementation effort.<br /><br />Please feel free to list your existing interface as well as those currently being built.<br />Also, if you are looking for an interface just ask, perhaps somebody already has it, or has an idea of how to do it.<br /><br />We will try to summarize the results once in a while to make this thread easier to read.</p>
