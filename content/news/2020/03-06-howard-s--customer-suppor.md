<p>We continue to enhance the <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/hisp" rel="nofollow">NOW Virtual Agent</a> in the Customer Support portal, ranging from new conversation topics to <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/administer/predictive-intelligence/concept/predictive-intelligence.html" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning</a> improvements to cosmetic upgrades.  If you’ve had the chance to try it out, leave a comment on this post with your experience! If you haven’t used it yet, you should take this post as a sign that you should.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ul><li>Efficiency - find actionable items in seconds</li><li>Make quick decisions in a snap</li><li>Explore areas of the Customer Support site you may not have thought of</li></ul>
