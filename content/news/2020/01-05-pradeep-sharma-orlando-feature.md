<p class="ng-scope">When Orlando release is around the corner, it’s time for us to learn together about the new features, enhancements, and APIs that will help those of you who would like to develop an application to list on the store or OEM. I&#39;m very excited and want to share with you about the followings.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Last week we opened up <a title="Early Access for Technology Partners" href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;7e5675fadbf1489013b5fb2439961936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Early Access for Technology Partners</a> to get their hands on Orlando, running it through its paces and preparing to submit their apps for certification</p>
<p class="ng-scope">In this post, we&#39;ll provide an overview of all the significant features and improvements that Technology Partners will want to be aware of, whether you are building apps for the ServiceNow Store or OEM. The TPP technical team is also working on doing deep dives into many of these areas, so stay tuned.</p>
