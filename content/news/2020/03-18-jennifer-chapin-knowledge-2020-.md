<p>Over the past few weeks, we have been closely monitoring the evolving COVID<span>-</span><span>19</span><span> pandemic. In order to protect the health and safety of our Knowledge 2020 attendees, partners, and community, we have made the decision to make Knowledge 2020 a digital community event that will launch on May 5 in place of the in-person event in Orlando, FL. ​</span><span> <br /></span></p>
<p><span>The Knowledge 2020 digital experience will showcase all the ways you can unlock productivity through modern digital workflows, highlight the latest customer and platform innovations, and inspire the ServiceNow community to continue to create great experiences for businesses.</span><span> <br /></span></p>
<p><span>In the coming days and weeks, we will provide details about the Knowledge 2020 digital experience. </span><span> We are committed to creating a phenomenal digital experience that will engage, inspire, and connect you to the best practices from our customers around the world. ​ </span><span> <br /></span></p>
<p><span>The global health crisis is creating new realities for all of us. Thank you for your patience as we evaluated this fluid situation and assessed the best way forward to bring the ServiceNow community together in a safe and healthy manner. We regret we won&#39;t see you in Orlando this year, but we are excited to stay connected digitally to share and learn from each other. That’s always been the power of the ServiceNow community.</span><span> <br /></span></p>
<p><span>See you online!</span><span> <br /></span></p>
