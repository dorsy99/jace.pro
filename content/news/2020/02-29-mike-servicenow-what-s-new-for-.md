<p>If you need a cure for the winter blahs, look no further. We’ve given key use cases and integrations for our Security Orchestration, Automation, and Reporting (SOAR) product, Security Incident Response, some great, smile- (and, more important, productivity-) inducing upgrades in this release.</p>
<h3>User Reported Phish Gets Even Better</h3>
<p>We’ve overhauled our phishing support which helps the SOC to avoid duplicate incidents and resolve confirmed phishing incidents faster with access to key investigation artefacts and machine learning based classification . This update automates consolidation of similar phishing incidents through a parent-child relationship and helps Analysts easily see associated events to help track the multiple targets during spear-phishing campaigns. Auto-extraction of email headers and related observables brings key details into the Analysts hands as they evaluate the attack. The update also includes the ability for the SOC to capture submissions made using Outlook plugins (such as Proofpoint Wombat) that enables employees to easily report a potential phishing email directly from their email client.</p>
<h3>New and Enhanced SIEM Integrations</h3>
<p>We are excited to announce updated, more user-friendly integrations for IBM QRadar SIEM and Microfocus ArcSight, in addition to our enhanced Splunk Enterprise Security integration. Drag-and-drop field mapping makes it simple to configure ingestion of incidents along with the supporting events. Filtering and aggregation of QRadar offenses makes investigation and response procedure more efficient. With two-way, real-time status updates, you’ll also keep your ServiceNow SOAR synced with your SIEM so that analysts are informed in real-time as new security events emerge on existing incidents and security alerts are closed out when the incident investigation concludes. </p>
