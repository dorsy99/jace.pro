<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">The new ServiceNow advertisements may have made you ask, “What more can<strong><em> I </em></strong>do to break through barriers and reduce friction within <strong><em>my</em></strong> work life?” Well, the latest release of Vulnerability Response will help tremendously. We’ve integrated across product boundaries, and within workflows to make your world of work, work better.</span></p>
<h3>Vulnerability Response Exposure Assessment</h3>
<p>Well &#x1f4a9;. A new exploit just hit the news that’s taking down computers around the globe. Sure, you could run an out-of-band vulnerability scan across your infrastructure, but that can take a long time to complete. How do you quickly determine which of your systems are vulnerable and make a plan of action to patch them? With our integration with ServiceNow Software Asset Management, you can now get an immediate understanding of your vulnerability exposure without waiting for the next vulnerability scan data. We can also automate remediation assignment, so you can move as quickly as possible to reduce your exposure. Learn more <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-security-management/page/product/vulnerability-response/concept/vr_sw_expsure_ovrvw.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Integrate Vulnerability and Change Management</h3>
<p>One of the greatest advantages of using ServiceNow Vulnerability Response is that you can get more value out of your investment in the ServiceNow platform. This benefit comes to life with our enhanced integration with Change Management. Now, Security teams can easily create change requests with all the information IT remediators need to patch vulnerabilities, and you can quickly and easily divide work amongst different teams or individuals using the new Split Group functionality. Plus, when the patches are applied and the Change request is closed, the vulnerability tasks are automatically updated. No more emails asking for status updates, no more wasting time trying to find the right patch to apply, IT and Security teams giving each other high fives for a job well done…everyone wins!! More information <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-security-management/page/product/vulnerability-response/concept/vuln_chg_mgmnt_tasks.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from one early adopter: “<em>GREAT JOB!  The “create change” workflow is beautiful, and the split group is exactly what we’ve been looking for.  Excellent job on this upgrade.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Automate grouping and routing</strong></h3>
<p>In Configuration Compliance, you can now define rules to aggregate misconfigurations into remediation tasks and automatically assign them to their accountable IT stakeholders. If the organization changes, so does the assignment, so work continues easily.  IT teams will like it because it replaces emails and spreadsheets with accurate information.

<h3 class="paragraph"><strong>Multi-source and Asset Tag Support for Rapid7</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraph">Asset tags defined in Rapid7 can now be imported into Vulnerability Response and used in condition builders to more effectively manage vulnerable items. And with multi-source support, vulnerability findings from multiple instances of Rapid7 can now be managed in Vulnerability Response.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">These updates and integrations are sure to put a smile on your face, and continue to drive success with your teammates in IT. </span></p>
