<p>ServiceNow is in the unique position of being able to effortlessly address front line employees because we were born in the front line. In the Orlando release we’ve taken that to a new level for not only the front line, but also risk and compliance teams.</p>
<h3>Advanced Risk Assessments</h3>
<p>Reporting risk is everyone&#39;s job, especially those in the front line.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s generally a cumbersome and inefficient process for employees who are asked to not only report risks but perform risk assessments. As an introduction to the discussion of Advanced Risk Assessments, let’s talk a bit about what it means to connect risk across the enterprise. Risks exist throughout the business, there are vulnerabilities associated with digital assets. Application risk – what happens if the ERP application become inaccessible or the customer facing eCommerce site goes down? How about, new risks associated with moving to the cloud and the need to protect sensitive data. For new devices (in the Internet of Things) and a growing number of vendors - how is risk managed and a resiliency plan built? And finally, what about operational risks that could affect business and shareholder value.</p>
<p>There needs to be a way to assess the different types of risk and connect them to get a holistic view of risk across the business. That enables risk-informed decision making, the ability to prioritize activities, and communicate effectively.</p>
<p>Advanced Risk Assessments is the way we calculate risk and continuously monitor for changes. In this release we have updated the Advanced Risk application to introduce the Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), specifically designed to assess Operational Risk. It provides a way to reduce the time spent on manual tasks and easily adapt when assessment methodologies change. Advanced risk assessments is a big step toward our vision of creating an integrated risk platform that can support various kinds of risk assessment methodologies and allows customers to integrate risk assessments as part of their overall decision-making process.</p>

<h3>Virtual Agent Chatbots for GRC</h3>
<p>Employees expect their business applications to offer a similar mobile and consumerized experience to that of their consumer apps.  Meanwhile, businesses see any experience that slows down work as a problem. Enter the chatbot for GRC… It is not the unfamiliar or cumbersome user experience that many other risk solutions provide. The GRC virtual agent chatbot is an intelligent assistant, that makes use of the AI capabilities in the Now Platform®.  Employees are walked through the process of making standard requests like looking up a policy, executing a policy exception, or reporting a risk event with simple prompts in plain English from their service portal - making GRC a user friendly and seamless part of everyday work.</p>

<h3>Policy Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>Every group has policies that they must adhere to for compliance purposes.  This can be a time-consuming, error prone, and cumbersome manual process for compliance managers, employees, and business owners, which is typically executed in silos. Tracking in many cases is accomplished through spreadsheets.  Evidence is stored on SharePoint sites or on local hard drives.  Information is scattered and not easily retrievable.</p>
<p>Policy Acknowledgement in the Orlando release provides the ability to send out policies such as Acceptable IT Use, Insider Trading, Code of Conduct, Privacy, and more across HR, Security, Finance, and IT for review and acknowledgement by employees.  Employees see the new acknowledgement request in their Service Portal to make it easy to respond. For risk and compliance managers, results are tracked within the record to measure compliance and dashboards can be used to communicate to other levels in the organization.</p>

<h3>Attestation Consolidation</h3>
<p>Regular attestations or risk assessments are a necessary part of managing an organization’s exposure. An organization needs to know if IT change management is in place, that the financial books were closed correctly, and that there have been no side deals made by sales at the end of quarter. But  it should not affect employee’s productivity or performance. Monitoring to identify changes in risk or compliance posture needs to be done in a more efficient way, such as organizing attestations and assessments by specific criteria and responding to them at scale.  </p>
<p>By grouping attestations together into either a single UI or by having the ability to answer similar questions once and apply the answer and evidence to multiple attestations, the user can avoid mind-numbing repetition.  This increases the efficiency of business control, risk or entity (asset, application, etc.) owners.</p>
