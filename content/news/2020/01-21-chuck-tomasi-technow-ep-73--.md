<p><br /> <strong>Questions and Answers</strong></p>
<div id="02fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbae"> </div>
<p><strong>Can you create a record producer in studio?</strong> -- Brent Kimsey<br /> Yes. Under Create Application File, you can either search for &#34;Record Producer&#34;, or navigate to Service Catalog on the left, and you&#39;ll find it there. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="06fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbab"> </div>
<p><strong>Can you access code search outside of studio?</strong> -- Derek Culbertson<br /> Not as of New York. It is on the roadmap and planned to be released soon. Stay tuned! -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="06fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb6"> </div>
<p><strong>where to get your book?</strong> -- Sandi Wilburn<br /> You can find an PDF version at http://bit.ly/sn-ncafd, or we will have hard copies at Knowledge 20! I&#39;ll even sign if if you like. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="0afed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb3"> </div>
<p><strong>Do we get a copy of your book?</strong> -- Duane van Gessel<br /> You can get a free electronic version at http://bit.ly/sn-ncafd or we will have paper copies available at Knowledge 2020. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="0efed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba5"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we use studio for Global scope? I guess the answer is no, if that’s true, some applications require interacting with/changing other global application files in global scope like adding field to incident table, or update a business rule in global scope etc. do we need to create global update set and make the changes outside studio or we can use studio for the same?</strong> -- Belal Salas<br /> Yes you can. This should help. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/manage_global_application_files.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="0efed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb0"> </div>
<p><strong>and the training on Needit Application this is super well written.</strong> -- Stephane RD<br /> Thank you. I&#39;ll pass that on to the authors. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="31fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb7b"> </div>
<p><strong>why when I want to start a new project (Mobile) there are some shared elements from other OOB project? i.e.  APPLICATION MENU (containing Mobile Agent and Now Mobile from Mobile Agent and NOW Mobile) That are part of the OOB project ITSM and NOW for Mobile Apps but are always included into any new Mobile Project... How I can have an independent Mobile App with my custom Menues without changing the OOB one? Also at the end of a custom project we have 2 scopes. One for the new Project as X_25_my_name and Global just for the Menu</strong> -- Eduardo Andres Pinetti<br /> I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to be getting that deep in to the mobile development. We are covering the basics of Studio, but not going deep in to any specific topic. This sounds like a great question for the community however. https://community.servicenow.com -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="31fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba3"> </div>
<p><strong>&#34;Commit Message&#34; is mandatory while pushing the changes second time into the source control, not while linking for the first time.</strong> -- Ramesh Babu Elagandula<br /> Ooohh. Thank you! -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="35fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba0"> </div>
<p><strong>If a team have access to manage a scoped app, they don&#39;t need to create update sets to create/modify/delete content for the same scoped app, right?</strong> -- Ramiro Rincon<br /> Correct. The preferred way to manage scoped apps is to publish to the app repo and then install on another instance. Update sets would only be required if you plan to share the app with someone outside your organization (not attached to your company code in the app repo.) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="39fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb80"> </div>
<p><strong>project level application releated objects</strong> -- Ibrahim Abdulwahid<br /> Nice description -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="39fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb9d"> </div>
<p><strong>You should point out the Build a NeedIt application in the Developer Training. The step by step guide to create an application is very good.</strong> -- Dana Miller<br /> Thank you -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="3dfed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb7d"> </div>
<p><strong>will you be covering the source control process in this session ?</strong> -- Ibrahim Abdulwahid<br /> Yes. Kreg will be connecting to a repository in GitHub. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="42fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb0"> </div>
<p><strong>When I publish the App, will it be stored in ServiceNow Server and associated with my Company?</strong> -- Hima Pallela<br /> Yes, that is correct. Think of it like your own private store to use for publishing and installing apps in your company. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="46fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbad"> </div>
<p><strong>also, i would like to learn the implications of studio in an instance configured for domain separation?</strong> -- Denwood Fairley<br /> Interesting question. An app is an app, it by itself cannot be domain separated. What you build in an app, whether it be a table or a workspace, that stuff can be domain separated. It’s really up to the developer working in Studio to ensure the contents of their app support domain separation. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="4afed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbaa"> </div>
<p><strong>i love studio!</strong> -- Denwood Fairley<br /> I love it as well. Having been around before Studio came along, it makes application management so much easier. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="4afed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb5"> </div>
<p><strong>could you gents re-do this presentation to match the voices, the screen you were working from never showed up in the presentation view. it was stuck on the first screen the entire time.</strong> -- Alex Albrecht<br /> Sorry you were having issues with ON24. Most times a browser refresh does the trick. In the mean time you can find the video on the community or directly on YouTube. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="4efed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba7"> </div>
<p><strong>about SCOPE, can you create a APP in global scope?</strong> -- Dean Kirstein<br /> Yes you can. This should help. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/manage_global_application_files.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="4efed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb2"> </div>
<p><strong>How does licensing works for Studio?</strong> -- Masoud Malekmohammadi<br /> Studio is part of the base platform. There is no additional licensing to use it. The applications created from studio may have licensing implications. I recommend you reach out to your account team if you are considering building new applications. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="71fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb7d"> </div>
<p><strong>regarding my same question about Mobile Menus...I was trying creating a new independent menu also by using ...Create Application file -&gt; Navigation -&gt; Application Menu (Mobile) but looks like does not work on Mobile at all What is the use of that element?</strong> -- Eduardo Andres Pinetti<br /> Apologies. This webinar was for the purpose of introducing people to Studio. We don&#39;t have time on this show to go in to specific issues or use cases for each attendee. I recommend posting our question to the ServiceNow community (https://community.servicenow.com) if you haven&#39;t already. There are a lot of smart people there who can help. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="71fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba5"> </div>
<p><strong>Studio is not really something I can use for modifying / adding to things in &#34;Global&#34;. I can only really use for new things that will be in their own Scope (Application). Is this correct?</strong> -- Wade Brown<br /> Yes you can manage global apps and pre-existing global files. This should help. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/manage_global_application_files.html -- <br /><br /></p>
<div id="75fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba2"> </div>
<p><strong>When using studio I noticed that not all application objects are found in studio and have to be added via classic. Are those objects saved in source control?</strong> -- Jeffrey Sue Ping<br /> Good question. Short answer is YES. -- <br /><br /></p>
<div id="79fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb82"> </div>
<p><strong>What is the Workspace, that is inaddition to mobile and classic? Is that something to do with Agent Workspace?</strong> -- subhash Darisipudi<br /> Yes. Workspace allows you to make your own Agent Workspace interfaces for your custom apps. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="79fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb9f"> </div>
<p><strong>Can I create an application from development that is already in our system? Flag scripts, notifications, tables etc that have been created previously.</strong> -- Wade Brown<br /> If you are creating a new application file, it&#39;s going to be considered unique (given a new sys_id) so it&#39;s not going to ever be able to say &#34;This already exists&#34;. I hope I understand your question properly. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="7dfed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb9c"> </div>
<p><strong>How can I make &#34;Dev Notes&#34; field a mandatory field to enfore my fellow devs to submit some notes before publishing new versions to our App Repository?</strong> -- Ramiro Rincon<br /> Good question. I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s configurable at this point, but I&#39;ll check and respond back on the community when I post this. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="82fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba7"> </div>
<p><strong>So can 2 people work on a widget together here?</strong> -- Ron Gidron<br /> When you edit a widget, it&#39;s done via the Service Portal Configuration page, a separate browser tab from Studio. I haven&#39;t tested concurrent editing on the configuration page yet, but I would do some testing before attempting it in a live dev instance. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="82fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb2"> </div>
<p><strong>yes, say &#39;search all applications&#39; or download global search from the store</strong> -- Adam Kaupisch<br /> Thank you for the tip. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="86fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbaf"> </div>
<p><strong>if you give &#34;admin&#34; role to an APP does that give people using that app &#34;admin&#34; for the entire SN system or just the APP scope</strong> -- Dean Kirstein<br /> The admin role for an app is only within the scope of that app, not the entire system - another reason to consider scoped apps! -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="8efed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba9"> </div>
<p><strong>Why can&#39;t we have SNUtils Chrome extension within ServiceNow? It is very helpful.</strong> -- Ramesh Babu Elagandula<br /> You can use that. Actually, Kreg uses it all the time, but I made him turn it off for this demo so people don&#39;t confuse SNUtils features with out-of-the-box Studio features. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="8efed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb4"> </div>
<p><strong>can I get a link to the recording of this webinar ?</strong> -- rao garu<br /> Absolutely. You can find this and all other episodes at http://bit.ly/servicenow-technow -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b1fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb9c"> </div>
<p><strong>If I would like to take the App Developer certification exam, having experience using Studio gives me the necessary knowledge to take it and pass it (either taking the App Dev course or not)?</strong> -- Ramiro Rincon<br /> While I don&#39;t know the exact content of the exam, I&#39;m certain that it covers elements of Studio so knowing Studio is a good thing when it comes to improving your chances of success on the exam. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b5fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb7c"> </div>
<p><strong>How can we find/allow citizen development? How&#39;s it possible to enable them without nit picking over everything they do? Is there a best practice?</strong> -- Bill Bonnett<br /> Kreg will be covering Delegated development in a little while. Watch for that feature. it should answer most of your questions. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b5fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba4"> </div>
<p><strong>Is there a way to browes history of changes for a record or bunch of files I commit over time?</strong> -- Ron Gidron<br /> Most records have a Versions related list you can view the changes? -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="b9fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb79"> </div>
<p><strong>HI I have some question regarding Creating Mobile App on Studio... sorry if not part of this presentation</strong> -- Eduardo Andres Pinetti<br /> The easiest way to create a mobile app is when you start with Guided Application Creator (New York and later). It&#39;s one click to get you started. If not, then you will need to start by creating an applet, data items, and other functionality. Please let us know if you need more specific information or check out the mobile training on https://nowlearning.servicenow.com. Thanks. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="bdfed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb81"> </div>
<p><strong>Is there a link to view the previous episodes ?</strong> -- Harish Ponnapureddy<br /> Yes. http://bit.ly/servicenow-technow. It&#39;s also in the resource widget on your screen. :) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="bdfed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb9e"> </div>
<p><strong>Sorry for joining late, have you covered &#34;Publish as Update Set&#34; yet? I will watch the recording in full later this week after it is published...</strong> -- Denwood Fairley<br /> We covered that in December&#39;s episode. This episode is all about Studio and exporting to update sets is not part of Studio. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c2fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba9"> </div>
<p><strong>how is the application accessed?</strong> -- Robert Ziegler<br /> I&#39;m not sure I completely understand the context of your question. If you create an application via Studio, it depends. You might have an app that is purely mobile, for example. If it has a classic component, then the browser is how users will interact with your app. I hope that answers your question. If not, please comment further in the comments section. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c2fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb4"> </div>
<p><strong>There is a way to do Code Search in the platform on the code search UI page but it doesn&#39;t provide direct links like in studio</strong> -- Todd Volpe<br /> Not sure if we were looking at the same page. There&#39;s a CodeSearchExampleUse UI page OOB, but it was somewhat limited. Were you looking at something else? -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c6fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba6"> </div>
<p><strong>What does your fitness app do?</strong> -- Sharon Williams<br /> It tracks Kreg&#39;s workouts (lifting, running, etc.) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="c6fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb1"> </div>
<p><strong>what are the servicenow best practices for creating an app to be publishes in the app store ? Many of the readily available servicenow classes only work in global scope, but the app needs to be created in local scope to get published.</strong> -- rao garu<br /> Many of the older classes have been updated or have scoped counterparts. If you have specific issues, please note them in the comments below and we can talk about possible solutions. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="cafed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbae"> </div>
<p><strong>Can you have multiple applications in one scope?</strong> -- Guy Stearns<br /> While you can create multiple application menus (with modules underneath), they would all be considered the same application because they are all in the same scope. If you are creating separate functionality (e.g. one app to track shipping orders and another to monitor the health of a refrigeration system) then I strongly recommend these be in separate scopes or maintenance and security could be a real issue down the road. Hope that answers your question. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="cefed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbab"> </div>
<p><strong>How does Studio compare with Visual Studio Code %2B SNOW Plugin ?</strong> -- Massimo Pascazi<br /> The VS Code Extension is used for offline editing and bringing the VS Code Experience to SN developers who want to work in that environment. Studio (SN) is purely for online access and offers things like context menus (e.g. getting docs from a class, or finding out where a class is being used). All configuration/editing is done within the browser. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="cefed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcbb6"> </div>
<p><strong>Will React JS be used in SN?</strong> -- Waldo Lavaut<br /> Not directly, but we are working on a way to expose it via web components in upcoming releases. You won&#39;t be doing React JS development directly which means you won&#39;t be creating &#34;technical debt&#34; as technologies continue to evolve - noting the history of Jelly and AngularJS. :) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="f1fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb81"> </div>
<p><strong>its a container....</strong> -- Ron Gidron<br /> You are right. That&#39;s the way I often explain it to people. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="f1fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcb9e"> </div>
<p><strong>does service-now has it&#39;s source control system where you can store application files?</strong> -- Ibrahim Abdulwahid<br /> We make use of Git based source control (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="f9fed1661bcb40102d1da9f9bc4bcba3"> </div>
<p><strong>Doesn&#39;t orlando allow editing files outside of a servicenow instance?</strong> -- Ryan Litwiller<br /> We&#39;re not allowed to say anything about Orlando until after March 19. :) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
