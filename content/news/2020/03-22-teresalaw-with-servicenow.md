This is why we implement Business Continuity Management.  It’s why we do business impact assessments, exercises that simulate disruptions, and why we have recovery plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Whether it&#39;s the existing crisis that prompts action or an ongoing internal initiative, it is crucial that you begin to understand what the worst looks like for your organization and that you begin to take actions to protect against it.  Even the worst can be manageable assuming the right processes and tools are in place.  Establish and implement recurring processes according to the BC/DR Lifecycle.  Leverage ServiceNow BCM to operationalize Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery by turning daily workflows into resilient practices.  With these processes and tools, the worst will start to look a lot better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Implementation</strong> – solutions are moved from design to practice in the form of response and recovery frameworks and plans</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Validation</strong> – readiness is enhanced through ongoing plan maintenance, plan reviews, and exercises/tests</span></p>
