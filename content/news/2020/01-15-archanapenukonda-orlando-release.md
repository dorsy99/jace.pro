<p>Those of you who&#39;ve been ServiceNow customers for a while know that we name our twice-a-year releases after cities. Our new release is &#34;Orlando&#34;. Orlando is often associated with the happiest place on earth - thanks to Disney World. I associate some more goodness with Orlando - including this release and the upcoming Knowledge 2020.  </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Orlando release, we focused on improving existing capabilities. As we grow with each release, we know that our customers do as well, and often that means putting focus on what already exists to ensure we meet your growing needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the purpose of this blog, I will focus on three key Orlando application enhancements for ITSM.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Agent Workspace enhancements</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Have you adopted Agent Workspace yet? If not, now is a great time, as we added even more intelligent actions that let fulfillers resolve incidents much faster. The goal with Agent Workspace is to continually improve efficiency of the IT support staff so that employees can maintain high productivity while rapidly resolving incidents. What are some ways we do this in Orlando?</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://community.servicenow.com/5fb975141ba2c410a59033f2cd4bcba0.iix" width="621" height="316" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">Intelligently assigning incidents to the Agent most familiar with issue</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well, issues get solved faster when assigned to agents most familiar with the customer and the context surrounding the problem. The new capability, Agent Affinity assigns a chat request or incident to an agent that has handled this chat or incident in the recent past to maintain continuity… resulting for good customer service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">Intuitive display of related Problems and Changes</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The improved Agent Workspace moves work along faster. It allows agents to create problems and changes associated with incidents, right within the workspace. There is no jumping from one page to the next and having more tabs open than you can count. Agents can solve the issue at hand within a single interface, making them even more efficient than ever before. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enabling a great Knowledge Base</span>  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Filling in Knowledge gaps is made easy. If a knowledge base article is unavailable or unknown, with a single click, agents can initiate workflows to fill these Knowledge gaps to ensure the right content is created. Once created, the new knowledge article will be available through Agent Assist for future occurrences of the problem or incident. </span></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ITSM Mobile Agent Enhancements </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are  using the ServiceNow Mobile apps, you are  seeing how simple and intuitive it makes your tasks - regardless of which side of the Service Desk you are on. The Agent app is meant for Service Desk Agents and it lets them carry their work in their pockets, giving the flexibility to be productive even if they are not at their desks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://community.servicenow.com/515a39541ba2c410a59033f2cd4bcb1e.iix" width="240" height="427" />  <img src="https://community.servicenow.com/566af9541ba2c410a59033f2cd4bcb93.iix" width="240" height="427" /></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Major incidents can now be managed on the app</span></p>
<p class="p1">The enhanced mobile agent app is enabling service desk agents to do more of their work on the go, allowing work to quickly get done since they are not tied down to a desk. Resolving major incidents is a great example. Agents can now manage, respond and view the progress of major incidents from their mobile devices. This ultimately allows there to be more swiftness with which teams come together, collaborate and resolve the issue.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dashboards in the app help prioritize work</span> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agents can prioritize work on the app through a dashboard that shows them incidents in various stages of lifecycle (risk, breached incidents, change tasks, catalog tasks, etc.). This enables critical issues to be handled with urgency, which means end users will have greater satisfaction. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agents even manage their shifts on the app</span> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agents can now manage schedules quickly on their phone with a visual calendar view. From this view, they can see their own schedule as well as the shifts they are covering for other agents. The agent can manage shifts to ensure adequate support coverage or simply request time off. Either way, it is all done on a single interface, decreasing the chances that there is a discrepancy in the schedule. <br /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Walk-Up Experience enhancements</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Customers love Walk-up Experience. Customers asked for easier ways to check in to the experience and we made those enhancements for you in the release. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> <img src="https://community.servicenow.com/78ba79941ba2c410a59033f2cd4bcbe1.iix" width="284" height="505" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">Check in to the queue through the Now Mobile app. Yay!</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Orlando, we’ve enabled easier check to Walk-up experiences. Users can check in to the walk-up queue through the service portal on their web OR on the go from the Now Mobile app. There is no need to go onsite just to check in to the que. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Or, swipe your badge onsite to check in</span> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you do choose to go onsite to check in, you can do so with the swipe of your badge. No need to spend time typing in your name and info. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">Help your colleague out by checking in their behalf</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also, if your colleague needs help getting into the queue but is unable to for some reason, you can now check them in on their behalf. How convenient is that?</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are of course a lot of other enhancements in Orlando. <a title="ServiceNow Docs" href="docs.servicenow.com" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow docs</a> is live if you are looking for detailed information on Orlando capabilities.
