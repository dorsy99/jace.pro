<p>Sustainable speed is the objective, the operating model, and the cultural bias for most of today’s high-performing organizations. As a result, they’re becoming capable of delivering instant, specific, frictionless value on a large scale. And they’re creating a world in which people, insights, and money interact quickly and easily.</p>
<p>This disruption is elevating organizations that find so many new opportunities inspiring. For others, it’s the opposite; such disruption can be distressing and in some cases, even threatening.</p>
<p>Virtually all the organizations we work with today are exploring and adopting innovative ways to operate their businesses. They’re looking to improve operations in ways that help workers to be more productive and engaged, and managers to be more insightful and effective. Together, that typically results in better quality and faster delivery for customers. Everyone wins—not the least of which are the businesses themselves. This new paradigm enables organizations to thrive in a world of rapid, unpredictable change.</p>
<p>In this environment, agility is among the most important qualities an organization can possess. And it’s why at ServiceNow, we strive to help customers be as agile as possible throughout the planning and delivery process.</p>
<p>Those that nurture and master agility are able to thrive in the most complex environments because they’ve developed the ability to spot business opportunities and threats early on and to respond with necessary changes quickly and adeptly. That allows these organizations to create not only new products and services, but entirely new business models and innovative ways to generate value for the company.</p>
<p>For this reason, we’re excited to introduce marquee ITBM capabilities centered on helping you achieve greater agility with our Orlando release. In this post, we’ll explore: <br /><br /></p>
<ul><li>New agile capabilities</li><li>A new agile mobile app</li><li>How machine learning can aid in innovation management</li><li>The power of better integrated workflows when managing project risks, issues, decisions, actions and changes</li></ul>
<p>Let’s dive in.  <br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>SCRUM PROGRAMS</strong></span></p>
<p>Most businesses today are doing team level agile, but struggling when they try to organize across multiple teams. Our latest ITBM capabilities help address this issue with scrum programs that enable deeper visibility into teams. This visibility allows them to organize workview dependencies, acquire insights into sprint capacity, and to see when specific teams are overloaded. In short, scrum programs provide a single, centralized view that includes key visualizations for planning and tracking the work being done across multiple teams for a specific outcome.  <br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>AGILE DASHBOARDS</strong></span></p>
<p>With Agile, visualizations of the work—dashboards showing trends and status with the ability to drill-down into the details—are essential. With the Orlando release, we’ve expanded our Performance Analytics solutions with pre-configured, out-of-the-box (OOTB) Agile Dashboards. <br /> <br />The Performance Analytics Content Pack for Agile 2.0 provides dashboards for the ServiceNow® Agile Development 2.0 application. These pre-configured dashboards are designed to provide valuable insight to help improve Agile processes and practices for the way you plan and execute software development work. New OOTB dashboards include:    </p>
<ul><li>Sprint dashboards for tracking scope, actual burndown, and forecast trends of previous sprints, as well as assistance in analyzing data to properly plan for upcoming sprints.  </li><li>Release dashboards for insights to plan the work for upcoming releases </li><li>Epic dashboards to visualize how stories of an epic are progressing. </li><li>Team dashboards for insight into how each team is progressing on stories over a given period of time.</li></ul>
<p>These dashboards are available in the <a title="ServiceNow Store Page " href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow store</a>.  <br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>AGILE WORK ITEM INTEGRATIONS </strong></span></p>
<p>With Orlando, we now support tools like Atlassian Jira and Microsoft Azure DevOps (ADO). By extracting data and process from these tools and integrating the information into the ServiceNow platform, status is synced at the program and/or portfolio level and a single system of record is created. This enhances executive reporting and improves overall business processes—and everyone gets to keep their tools of choice.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>AGILE MANGEMENT MOBILE APP</strong></span></p>
<p>In the New York release, ITBM introduced the Project Status Mobile application, which enabled project team members, portfolio managers, and business stakeholders to track the health of projects. </p>
<p>In Orlando, we’re expanding these mobile capabilities and introducing the Agile Management Mobile application. This new app makes each agile team directly accessible from the home page, and enables visibility into each team’s work (such as stories and tasks) so you can view team progress and manage current sprint work while on-the-go. And scrum team members are always up to date with current sprint status.  <br /> <br />The app also surfaces roadblocked stories and includes drill-down capabilities into story details for faster resolution. This mobile solution is an important upgrade for scrum masters and product owners. <br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>INNOVATION MANAGEMENT WITH SIMILAR IDEAS</strong></span></p>
<p>Your employees can be an amazing source of innovative ideas. But if it’s too complicated to share them, you may miss out. To address this, we’ve introduced Innovation Management, which allows you to capture, vote on, vet, and track ideas—all from a single location within our existing Innovation Portal. To make it as easy as possible, we’ve added machine learning capabilities that identify similar or duplicate ideas so that they may be grouped and surfaced more easily.  </p>
<p> <br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>SAVE TIME WITH INTEGRATED WORKFLOWS</strong> </span></p>
<p>People want project management to be easy. If we follow all project management guidelines, we end up spending too much time managing and not enough time doing. For this reason, we’re introducing new workflows designed to automate and simplify work. </p>
<p>The new RIDAC (Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions and Changes) workflows help save time with integrated workflows and traceability provided by Flow Designer. You can now eliminate time-consuming, manual processes by automating the movement of work; for example, moving “risks” to “issues.” And you can easily update RIDAC from your mobile device.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong> </span></p>
<p>Our latest ITBM update includes a number of key improvements: Scrum Program Planning Boards, OTTB Agile dashboards, Agile work integrations with Jira and ADO, an Agile Mobile App, machine learning capabilities within the innovation portal, and improved workflows for managing project risks, issues, actions, changes, and more.  </p>
