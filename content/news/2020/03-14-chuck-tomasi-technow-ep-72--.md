<div id="95930d77dbe6001083bd7646bf9619f3"> </div>
<p><strong>Big thanks to Chuck for calling out what&#39;s a paid feature and what isn&#39;t. Wish this was done for all ServiceNow presentations.</strong> -- Tyler Herman<br /> You are welcome. We will do our best to indicate that in the future. Some things are constant (like IntegrationHub), but others like the mobile branding kind of surprise me. There must be some additional service involved that pushed in that direction. Not sure. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Is it going to be PARIS next year ;-)</strong> -- Sebastian Di Loreto<br /> Yes! (Kreg is kidding, or misunderstanding the context.) Knowledge is NOT going to be in Paris in 2021. We are going back to Las Vegas for 2021 and 2022. -- Kreg Steppe<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Kreg&#39;s comments are hard to understand</strong> -- Jan Vromant<br /> Sorry about that. He realized too late that he was using the wrong microphone. We&#39;ve made a note to check all that before we go live. We definitely appreciate the comment though. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a5934d77dbe6001083bd7646bf961979"> </div>
<p><strong>will there be improved support for time zones and offsets</strong> -- Daniel Rubin<br /> I haven&#39;t heard any plans. That doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t happen, only that I haven&#39;t been privvy to that information yet. If you would like to see that, I recommend a post in the idea portal on our community site (community.servicenow.com). That&#39;s where our product managers get a lot of their ideas. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Should we expect the Now Experience to expand to the Service Portal?</strong> -- Jonathan Cooke<br /> My understanding at this point is that Service Portal will continue to live on as an AngularJS technology. Now Experience will be available at some point as a new alternative for portals. That&#39;s what I know, but it may change so... -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a9934d77dbe6001083bd7646bf961981"> </div>
<p><strong>Guided Setups are helpful when deploying new applications and adopting release updates/ changes. Is servicenow investing in guided setups for some of these applications and newer features to help us adopt and use them easier and faster</strong> -- Jennifer Schoenhoeft<br /> Hi Jennifer, I totally agree that Guided Setups are a great thing and I wish they were more wide spread. Right now they seem to be on the &#34;big features&#34; like ITOM and ITSM. My personal opinion is that ever app that has any properties or pre-config should have one (including those in the store). I know ServiceNow is always considering them, but right now they are restricted in who can build them (ServiceNow developers only). No good &#39;admin tools&#39; are available. If you like, upvote my idea on the community to get builder tools in the hands of all developers so we can have more Guided Setups. https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;view_idea&amp;sysparm_idea_id&#61;6b27493f1be6c0d0fff162c4bd4bcb21&amp;sysparm_idea_table&#61;x_snc_com_ideation_idea&amp;sysparm_module_id&#61;enhancement_requests -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

So when is going to be public available?</strong> -- Ramiro Rincon<br /> I went looking and didn&#39;t see any docs on it other than mentioned in the Now Platform CI/CD page. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub-store-spokes/concept/cicd-spoke.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>is this session being recorded? This feature could be very interesting for my customer</strong> -- Attila Winter<br /> Yes, this is being recorded.

<p><strong>Any updates on Agent Workspace for HRSD?</strong> -- Robert Card<br /> Sorry, I don&#39;t have enough information about HRSD at this point. I recommend you watch the keynote and spotlight webinars on March 19. We will have live Q&amp;A there. I suspect someone in the HR related spotlight can provide insight. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>According to the Orlando documentation, Coaching Loops is being deprecated. What replaces it?</strong> -- Ron Lehmann<br /> If you are using it, it won&#39;t go away. We just won&#39;t be providing any more support and the plugin will only be available by requesting it from ServiceNow. We try very hard not to remove things from the platform. There may be plans (or perhaps current products I&#39;m unaware of) in the employee workflows (HR). Someone with more HR knowledge than I may know. Sorry. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
