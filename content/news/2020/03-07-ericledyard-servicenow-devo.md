<p><strong><em>Welcome to Episode 7 of our DevOps Podcast Series!</em></strong></p>
<p>In this episode, we chat with Charles Betz about the state of DevOps. (This was filmed in Fall 2019 at DOES US) He walks us through his history of how he got to DevOps and what his roles are in Enterprise Service Management as well as DevOps. His perspective is very unique in that he bridges the worlds between ITIL/ITSM and Operational Frameworks as well as analyzing DevOps and how that will evolve over time. His predictions are that legal needs to be involved in the new operational models soon. As we transform the DevOps landscape, we continue to overcome each challenge we encounter. In 2019, we started looking at how to get auditors involved in the discussion, and his thought is that in 2020, we will be trying to get Lawyers involved from corporate to understand the implications of the op model.</p>
<p>Also had a great conversation about the human aspects of IT and how companies need to understand the fact that rapid innovation increases risk. Risk increases stress. Stress itself causes increased risk, and eventually, this cycle can come together and cause significant outages in Production. Discusses the MTTR Paradox that he published as well.</p>
