<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On behalf of ServiceNow, I want to welcome you and I want you to know that we’re in this together. We have built our COVID-19 Resources forum as a place to collaborate, share suggestions for new apps and innovations, and discuss how you’re using the Now Platform to help your company deal with this pandemic. I know that we all can learn from each other and this forum will help our broader communities stay safe and healthy.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We’ve also launched an App Suggestion Portal where you can suggest improvements to our existing apps, submit suggestions for new apps, or vote on suggestions from others. Partners and Developers who create new apps can submit them for review in the Store to be added to the COVID-19 Apps section.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We welcome your engagement, feedback, and participation.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sincerely,</span></p>
