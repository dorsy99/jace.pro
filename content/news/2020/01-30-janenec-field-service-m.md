<p>The Orlando release is a big deal for ServiceNow® Field Service Management. As of today, it is now a separate, standalone product. If you currently use Field Service Management, don’t worry—the only change you’ll see are new features. If you’ve been considering Field Service Management, you now have the option to purchase it on its own (though it still works great with both Customer Service Management and IT Service Management).</p>
<p>The first, and biggest, new feature improves the integration between Field Service Management and Customer Service Management by allowing customer service agents to create new work orders using Agent Workspace. In addition, they can view and update the work orders attached to a customer service case. This provides a simpler experience for customer service agents, who previously had to go into a different view of ServiceNow to access work orders.</p>
<p>From a customer service case, it requires just a click to start a new work order. Agents can access work order templates, which ensure the correct parts, tasks, and technician skills are associated with the work order. Then Dynamic Scheduling can automatically assign the new work order tasks to qualified technicians to complete the work.</p>
<p><em><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/8fa8b347dbaa8094414eeeb5ca961912.iix" width="717" height="404" border="1" /></em></p>
<p><em>Create, view, and edit work orders directly from Agent Workspace</em></p>
<p>Advanced map pages allow the creation of custom maps without coding to show the location of items that may impact technicians and scheduling. These maps can show objects, like cell towers or inventory locations, for example, as icons on the map. Dispatchers can view and interact with these icons to make better scheduling decisions.</p>

<p><em>Create a custom map to show key locations without code.</em></p>
<p>Central Dispatch, the visual task board for scheduling work order tasks, received a number of enhancements to improve the scheduling process. For the dispatcher, we’ve made sorting unassigned tasks easier with a date range filter. Selecting a date range will only show those work order tasks pending dispatch that fall within the range. Removing the selection will show all unassigned tasks. There’s also a new date picker to quickly jump to a desired date view.</p>
<p> <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/55193b8bdbaa8094414eeeb5ca961980.iix" width="717" height="403" border="1" /></p>
<p><em>Filter unassigned tasks by date range in Central Dispatch</em></p>
<p><br />Dispatchers can also assign tasks to the technician with the maximum required parts. Each technician’s name is displayed with how many of the required parts they have on-hand (e.g. 1/3) to identify the most appropriate technician for the task. Dynamic Scheduling can also take this into account for automatic scheduling. Assigning tasks to technicians who already have the right parts allows the request to be completed faster.</p>
<p>The final Central Dispatch enhancement is the ability to assign one or more preferred technicians to a specific account. When a technician deals with a specific customer regularly, they build a relationship in addition to being more familiar with the customer’s assets. Continuing to build that relationship through repeat assignment is beneficial for the customer and technician. When a technician is designated as preferred, they can be scheduled manually or automatically when they are available for a new task with their customer.</p>

<p>Lastly, we’ve added a new feature for mobile part transfers in the ServiceNow Agent app. This mobile app has been available for iOS or Android devices for a while, but we continue to make enhancements to the functionality. The Agent app is very important for Field Service Management, as much field work is done in locations where only a mobile device is convenient.</p>
<p>Mobile part transfers allow field service technicians to complete pick up or drop off part transfer orders directly in the mobile app. This provides technicians clear visibility of which parts are in stock and available, as well as what they need to pick up or drop off for a day’s tasks. Transfers can be completed with a simple swipe, and tracking transactions on mobile improves both the timeliness and accuracy of inventory.</p>
