<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"><span class="s1">Incidents are the result of service failures or interruption. The goal of Incident Management is to <strong>r</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>estore services faster </strong>by enabling agents to manage work and collaborate using a single platform for IT processes, <strong>drive lower call volume </strong>using the self-service portal and ServiceNow chatbots and <strong>deliver a better consumer experience </strong>through intuitive omnichannel self-service and transparent, two-way communications.</span><span class="s1"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">This series of lessons describes and demonstrates how the service agent receives or creates an incident and how the incident is managed and tracked, from occurrence to classification, investigation, resolution, and closure. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">This path and all courses within are targeted to the process user or service agent. The series of courses introduces the Incident Management process on the Now Platform, including the goals of Incident Management and its lifecycle: creation and classification of incidents, documenting the incident investigation, and how incidents are resolved and closed.  In these courses you will learn how to define Incident Management, how to locate the Incident application and describe the high-level functions of each module and how to use the Now Platform to create, manage, and resolve an incident record. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">These trainings reflect a base Now Platform with little to no custom configuration. Your actual platform configuration will vary with the needs of your organization.  </span></p>
