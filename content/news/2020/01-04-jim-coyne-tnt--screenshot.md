<h5>Part of the &#34;<a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;bf19f1b21b0a4010d01143f6fe4bcb50" rel="nofollow">Tips &#39;N Tricks</a>&#34; series of posts</h5>
<p>This is the first post of the new series.  Not exactly a platform TNT, but something helpful nonetheless for users looking for help here on the Community.  If your post includes code, please post it as formatted text and not just a screenshot.  I&#39;ll admit to have passed by a couple posts because it only included a screenshot and I was not about to re-type everything from scratch to help out.  Maybe I&#39;m getting lazy?</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to do.  In the &#34;Description&#34; field, click on the <img src="https://community.servicenow.com/ae18b13e1bc64010d01143f6fe4bcb85.iix" /> icon in the toolbar:</p>
<p><img src="https://community.servicenow.com/d897f53a1bc64010d01143f6fe4bcb1e.iix" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A popup window will appear.  Select the appropriate &#34;Language&#34; option and then paste the code in the text box:</p>
<p><img src="https://community.servicenow.com/8bf679761bc64010d01143f6fe4bcb90.iix" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The code will then appear nicely formatted, making it easy for others to read, copy and modify to help you out:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>(function() {
  //this is just a sample block of code

})();</code></pre>
<p> </p>
