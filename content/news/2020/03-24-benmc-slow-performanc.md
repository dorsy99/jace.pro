<p>With the release of Mobile in Newyork ,there are concerns from customers on the time to load Service Catalog related applets in now mobile. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>In  Newyork and also in previous releases Service Catalog has added indexes to tables for performance improvements. These indexes were zboot only so the upgrade customers may be missing out them and running in performance issues.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This KB provides a list of all the indexes on the tables in use in mobile as on Newyork zboot instance.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are noticing slowness on now mobile app, please check if your instance tables have the mentioned indexes here.</div>
