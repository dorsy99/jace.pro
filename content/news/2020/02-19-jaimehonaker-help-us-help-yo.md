<p>We are working on ways to recognize our employees for a job well done when creating a new KB article, and would love your help!</p>
<p>If there is a Knowledge Base article that you’ve bookmarked and refer to often, or even a KB article that has helped you, and you’d like to thank the individual that created it, let us help you with that!</p>
<p>What we are looking for:</p>
<ul><li>Regularly referred to KBs</li><li>Bookmarked troubleshooting guides</li><li><ul><li>Frequently searched for landing pages</li><li>Known Errors that gave you the “aha!” moment.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Leave the KB number below in the comments with anything else you’d like to say about it or how it helped you, and we can pass it on to the teams. Thank you! </p>
