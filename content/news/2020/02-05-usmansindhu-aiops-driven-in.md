<p>Modern customer experiences run on digital services. But it takes an intelligent operation to deliver high-performing services. When our customers asked us to make operations work, work better for people, we addressed their 3 key challenges in Orlando:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Lack of visibility into full stack</strong>– IT infrastructure is getting complex, spread across cloud, serverless, containers, Kubernetes, and microservices. IT operations need complete visibility into their state, changes, and issues before impacting customers.</li><li><strong>Poor service performance</strong>– Pinpointing issues faster without impacting service performance is key in delivering digital outcomes. But often manual processes come in the way to manage service performance at scale.</li><li><strong>Manage cloud experience</strong>– Today’s experiences run on multi-cloud environments. But IT operations struggle to reduce cloud cost since they’re not aware of who used what recourses. In addition, service providers can’t deliver unique experiences to their customers in a tailored way due to lack of multi-tenant capabilities.</li></ul>
<p>Let’s see what’s in store for you in Orlando to start solving these challenges.</p>
<p><strong>ITOM Visibility</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tag-based Service Mapping</strong> - Tagging resources has become the de facto standard for establishing governance models for cloud and container workloads such as Kubernetes, OpenShift, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and others. Tag-based service mapping seamlessly maps Mode 2 environments making it easier to manage, search, and filter resources. It can associate resources to application service, cost center, project, or other entities for faster retrieval of information and getting business outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Inventory and Management</strong>- Believe it or not, expired certificates are one of the top contributors to service outages. Certificate Inventory and Management gets you an inventory of all your certificates paired to your IT environment. In addition, you get a digital workflow that alerts you of expiring certificates and creates tasks to take action without impacting critical services. This way you can manage a complete certificate lifecycle</p>
<p>from origination to expiration and renewal by pairing them to the supported services</p>
<p>in one platform.</p>

<p> <strong>ITOM Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator workspace</strong>- Too often, customers have a plethora of stand-alone tools trying to help them ensure business-critical services remain healthy but are challenged with a complete integrated view. With Operator Workspace which helps customers manage all of their digital services at scale with ease, within a single, integrated workspace. With AIOPs driven machine learning, you have an ability to quickly drill down to identify, isolate and resolve problems.</p>

<p> <strong>ITOM Optimization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cloud Insights</strong>– Typically, companies waste 30% of cloud resources due to lack of knowledge of who is using what. In addition, traditional cloud optimization solutions are broken, stand-alone, and not part of the IT Operations or ITSM change control processes. Cloud Insight helps organizations gain insight into who is using what cloud resources, optimizing cloud costs by providing automated recommendations and actions to reduce cloud waste, and providing visibility into the organizations overall cloud spend.  With built-in algorithms looking at particular tags such as owner, cost center, data center, and others, it intelligently creates recommendations for you to save where you didn’t have visibility.  Cloud Insights support AWS today.</p>

<p><strong>Domain separation</strong>– Managed Service Providers (MSPs) struggle to provide unique cloud experiences to their customers due to lack of multi-tenancy. With Domain Separation in the Cloud Provisioning and Governance* product, they can provide tailored experience to their customers. MSPs can provision cloud accounts, enable policy &amp; governance, and extend self-service catalogues to spin up resources and dedicated environments for their customers.</p>
