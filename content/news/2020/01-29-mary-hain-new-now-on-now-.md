<p><strong>New Now on Now case study: Driving strategic portfolio planning and execution using the Now Platform </strong></p>
<p>Our IT Project Management Office (PMO) saw a 45% increase in demand for high-quality IT projects that deliver measurable business value last year. Existing processes and delivery methods simply could not scale.  </p>
<p>This new case study explores how ServiceNow’s IT PMO utilizes the power of the Now Platform, specifically ServiceNow Project and Portfolio Management (PPM), to plan, prioritize, execute, and report on our IT projects and ensure projects deliver value to the organization.</p>
<p>By integrating modules for the ServiceNow Agile Development and ServiceNow Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) methodologies, we are able to integrate demand, execution, and value realization into single platform and scale our output without significantly increasing our staff.</p>
<p>Through continuous training and adoption of new platform features, we’ve been able to improve reporting quality, cross-functional project and portfolio visibility, and measure business value along the way.</p>
