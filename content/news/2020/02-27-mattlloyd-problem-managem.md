<h2>Track Continual Improvement Management (CIM) as a fix for a problem</h2>
<p>Problem management will notify the assigned to problem user when all problem related fixes are completed or canceled, that is their cue to come back to the problem to decide if any more work is needed.</p>
<p>If you are licensed for Continual Improvement Management (CIM) and have activated the plugin (*3), then from Orlando, Improvement Initiatives (CIM) can be tracked as a fix for a problem.<br />Fixes can now include: Changes, Defects, Enhancements or Improvement Initiatives.</p>
<p><em>Note: Refer to the ITSM Guided Setup &gt; Problem Management &gt; Related Lists in your system for information on activating the optional related list for CIM.</em></p>
