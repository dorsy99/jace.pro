<p><strong><em>Welcome to Episode 6 of our DevOps Podcast Series!</em></strong></p>
<p>In this episode, we do our best to summarize almost 8 hours of presentations from the Predict 2020 virtual conference held by devops.com. We break down 14 different presentations and try to capture the highlights of each and provide a summary that you can digest in the car on the way to the office. Hopefully, you will see what you care most about and dive deeper into the content they host on their site. <a href="https://predict2020.io/" rel="nofollow">https://predict2020.io/</a></p>
