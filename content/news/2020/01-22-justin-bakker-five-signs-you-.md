<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-servicenow-platform/page/administer/workflow/concept/c_WorkflowOverview.html" rel="nofollow">Workflow Engine</a> is great; it forms the core of any business application running on the ServiceNow platform. It allows you to write complicated business processes in an easily understandable and manageable way. Using the flow-based principles forces you to think through the application process in terms of design and usability. You’re writing the workflow in visual terms, rather than code, after all, and that encourages you to make sure everything is readable. It can be as simple as an approval process to request a new phone or as complex as defining the life cycle of an employee onboarding process. You write the workflow and away you go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">I know, there’s a bit more to it and in all fairness, with all those multi-level approvals, timers, waiting conditions and of course scripting, it can be pretty complicated. But in any case, it’s still a lot easier than writing the whole thing in code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 18pt; color: #008080;">Go with the flow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">But then we introduced <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/concept/flow-designer.html" rel="nofollow">Flow Designer</a>, and slowly but surely you’re starting to take notice. We’re adding more <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/now-platform-capabilities/flow-designer-rn.html" rel="nofollow">features in every release</a>, and you might be starting to wonder: what is it all about? Should you rewrite all your workflows and make them into new flows? Is there any need for workflows at all?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Flow Designer was first introduced in Kingston. Don’t worry, workflows (and subsequently the Workflow Engine) won’t go away and all your workflows will be quite safe. But Flow Designer is the way forward and at the very least it’s worth considering it as an alternative. Not convinced? Let’s have a look a few pros and cons of switching to Flow Designer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Cons</span></strong></span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">You appreciate the flexibility Workflow Engine has to offer in creating activities and adding code if you need it.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">You invested loads of time in learning to write workflows and you&#39;re not sure you want to switch.</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Pros</span></strong></span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Flexibility comes at a cost: as you developed your workflow you branched out dramatically and the workflow has started to represent a piece of abstract art. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mistakes might emerge in the implementation of workflows and you end up with issues in production which are not easy to resolve. Flows will help you to prevent this. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Depending on how huge the workflows are, this is more likely to make it extremely difficult to debug. </span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 18pt; color: #008080;">Constraints to enhance the experience</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">These are the sort of problems we are trying to address in Flow Designer. We couldn’t change the Workflow Engine to achieve this, we had to start from scratch. First things first, Flow Designer is similar to Workflow Engine in terms of what it does: actions to insert, update, delete and query are all there. The aim is still to automate a business process – we want ServiceNow developers to execute data without having to code. But we approach it differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Where Workflows offer you flexibility, we decided to restrict this in Flow Designer and use this constraint to enhance the experience. We opted for a more linear approach in terms of actions a user can execute. It might seem like a limitation, but this choice was deliberate. It avoids the complex diagrams and makes the Flows more supportable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">So rather than this:</span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/41889f601b620490ada243f6fe4bcbf9.iix" width="560" height="312" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">We do this:</span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/c409d3241b620490ada243f6fe4bcbab.iix" width="611" height="271" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">By offering a more structured approach we enable users, who are not necessarily familiar with coding, the ability to design, execute and query data without having to do any scripting, while still catering to the needs of the advanced users and offering a wide range of possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Not convinced yet? Let’s put together a Flow and have a look at how it’s all put together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 18pt; color: #008080;">Get a Cup of Tea: a WorkFlow example in Flow Designer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Rather than just a standard example that triggers on an update of a record and sets a field, let’s use something a bit more challenging to really get a feel how the Flow Engine handles this. I propose we build a fulfilment process for a service request called ‘Get a Cup of Tea’.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica;">1. Flows need to trigger on something that’s happening: it’s usually an update, insertion or deletion on a particular table. Since I’m building a fulfilment process for a service request, I’m choosing Service Catalog. To link it to a specific Service Request, I open the Catalog Item and tell it what Flow to use.</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/668750051b6e0c90ada243f6fe4bcbeb.iix" width="455" height="127" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">2. So far so good. Flows use the principle of linear actions which compare to activities in Workflow Engine. The idea is the same in that we’re constructing a series of actions we want the flow to execute, but we have to do that within the framework Flow Designer dictates. My Request Item includes a few variables like what I want to order, who I want to order it for, etc. This is the action ‘Get Catalog Variables from Get a Cup of Tea’. Next, I’m doing an If Action to check if Approval has been requested (imagine getting tea without management approval), here’s how I’m handing this:</span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/8f1994811bae0c90ada243f6fe4bcb32.iix" /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">3. Notice the use of ‘If Actions’ and how this is reflected in the numbering and the UI. Also notice the Group of actions, which we use to enhance readability. I know, in this particular example it’s all a bit excessive (you might as well walk over to the kettle yourself), but I hope you appreciate how the constraints of the framework work in your favour, and allow you to create complex but structured processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 18pt; color: #008080;">Put on the kettle and have a REST (and other cool features)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">I just want to highlight the action Send Tea Order. This is a <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-servicenow-platform/page/administer/flow-designer/concept/actions.html" rel="nofollow">custom action</a> which sends a REST request and provides a great way to integrate with external systems. My Tea Maker happens to have a REST API and in order to automate everything I send my request straight from the Flow.</span></p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="https://community.servicenow.com/520614851b2e0c90ada243f6fe4bcb24.iix" width="518" height="279" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">It’s a particular favourite option for me: to do this I wrote a custom action where I construct the exact HTTP request I want. The flexibility of REST APIs had to be matched with flexibility on the Flow Designer’s side and as I was able to deal not only with the HTTP request but also deal with the HTTP responses the API can send.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">We also tried to make testing and troubleshoot easier to achieve. Like Workflows we create a context record where the executing of the flow is stored, but unlike Workflows, it is now also possible to test the flow before you use it. Via the button test you can attach any test record to see how it behaves and examine the context record afterwards to understand what happened. By testing it thoroughly before publishing you can avoid any obvious problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 18pt; color: #008080;">Flow Designer is the way to go</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">I know what you’re thinking: I can do all of this with Workflows. And you’re right, at least for now. Our focus is to develop a new way to write business processes and the new linear approach does not leave room for many mistakes in its implementation. We want to allow users to create a simple execution without the need of having “Run Script” activities like we do in workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">Our focus is firmly on Flow Designer. In each new release Flow Designer is improved, and new functionality is added. For example, from Orlando we added Flow Designer support for SLAs and as we go forward, we will develop Flow Designer further and further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">But what do you think? Have you given Flow Designer a go yet? Is there anything preventing you from doing this, or do you have any feedback you can share with us? Please let me know and leave a comment at the bottom of this article. I’d love to hear from you!</span></p>
