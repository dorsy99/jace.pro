<p><br /> <strong>Questions and Answers</strong></p>
<div id="1f03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961951"> </div>
<p><strong>The slack message for commit approval is automatic or I need to implement the communication between SN and Slack?</strong> -- Amauri Chagas Junior<br /> Chris added the action to his flow. If you want to have Slack communications, you can use the same type of Flow Designer action. Short answer - you can build what you want with the pieces we provide. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195a"> </div>
<p><strong>Is this new Flow Designer in New York or just Orlando?</strong> -- Smalls Ernest<br /> Now Platform CI/CD requires Orlando and later. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961965"> </div>
<p><strong>is it required to have designated Mid Server just for this CICD?</strong> -- Dinh Tong<br /> Not unless some/part of your process is on-premise. If you are doing this all with cloud instances (including Git, Jenkins, etc.) then you don&#39;t need a MID server. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961957"> </div>
<p><strong>I just saw the message about collisions show up - but that was specific to a script include/code. What if Neha was making a change to form layout and Mudit tried to do that as well? That would be XML and not specifically code/javascript. What if Neha was making label changes in sys_dictionary and Mudit tried to do the same on the same table? How does CICD show collisions on things that are not specifically code, but are more UI-based and XML-based?</strong> -- Julie Leung<br /> The capability naming is kind of confusing… its not really a &#34;collision&#34;. its just a feature to help developers not mix up each other&#39;s source control commits new messages. The update sets in the background work as they always have… if two developers are making changes at the same time (script, config, or otherwise), the latest change wins. -- Chris Faulkner<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961962"> </div>
<p><strong>When would the VSCode plugin be able to do git stuff like studio?</strong> -- Neji Tawo<br /> Orlando -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2b03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961954"> </div>
<p><strong>Does this work on Global scoped apps?</strong> -- Neji Tawo<br /> Yes it does.The only piece that doesn&#39;t work is source control -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2b03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195f"> </div>
<p><strong>can you explain a global scoped app?</strong> -- Adam Laubach<br /> https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_ApplicationScope.html -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="2f03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195c"> </div>
<p><strong>what would happen when testing fails?</strong> -- Dinh Tong<br /> It&#39;s up to you. Obviously, wouldn&#39;t want to publish to prod for a failed test. You could configure your flow to notify the dev team of the issue and they can resolve it and submit new changes. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="5303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961951"> </div>
<p><strong>Can this support more than one test instance</strong> -- Seth Werly<br /> Yes, we can support multiple instances. When you create your flow, you direct it where to run the ATF tests. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="5703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96194e"> </div>
<p><strong>Can you demonstrate how CI/CD would deal with multiple developers doing configurations on the same form or table/schema? (e.g. add a new field at table level, configuration of form layout, change of labels and other items on sys_dictionary) -- things that are usually UI-driven configuration and less script/script includes, specifically?</strong> -- Julie Leung<br /> There&#39;s a nice message that comes up when someone makes a change and someone else tries to modify it. It&#39;s read-only until you explicitly say you want to change it. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="5f03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961953"> </div>
<p><strong>just to clarify, the ATF test is running in TEST not PROD right?</strong> -- Brian Good<br /> Yes, ATF was running on his TEST/UAT instance. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195c"> </div>
<p><strong>How does the rollback works in-case of failure(s)?</strong> -- Yash Kedia<br /> It rolls back to the previous version, much like uninstalling an app. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961959"> </div>
<p><strong>in Orlando this example will only work when deploying a scoped app right? Not Global</strong> -- Brian Good<br /> Correct. Global is targeted for a future release. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961964"> </div>
<p><strong>This is mind-blowingly faster than pushing update sets through a pipeline manually!</strong> -- Jeremiah Abot<br /> I agree. I can&#39;t wait for customers to get their hands on it and save time. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6b03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961956"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we deploy directly from branch and not deploy all changes from master ?</strong> -- Prashant Parekh<br /> Yes you can. You can declare which branch in the deploy action/subflow. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6b03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961961"> </div>
<p><strong>while we wait for Paris, can we use ServiceNow native APIs and call from Jenkins in NY release?</strong> -- Prashant Parekh<br /> The APIs are available in Orlando and higher (not New York). Yes, you can use the APIs from Jenkins starting with Orlando. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="6f03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195e"> </div>
<p><strong>When is paris open for developer preview?</strong> -- Neji Tawo<br /> We are targeting Q3 for the release of Paris. Typically the developer preview is roughly 6 weeks ahead of general availability. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="9303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961953"> </div>
<p><strong>Like scheduled ATF currently, is there a need for an open browser window somewhere or is that handled on the platform somewhere</strong> -- Seth Werly<br /> If it&#39;s a server based test, no. If there are UI tests, then currently, yes. We are looking to change this in future releases. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="9703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961950"> </div>
<p><strong>Is there a plugin we need to enable in order to get the Deployment Request tables?</strong> -- Julie Leung<br /> The deployment request table is something Chris built for this demo. He&#39;s going to make it available on the Share section of the developer portal and GitHub as an example after this webinar. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195e"> </div>
<p><strong>Could this be used for scoped applications built by ServiceNow such as Customer Service Management or HR?</strong> -- Stijn Verhulst<br /> Yes -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195b"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we do the flow designer for a Global scope app without github integration?</strong> -- Neji Tawo<br /> Yes -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="a703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961966"> </div>
<p><strong>so instructive as usual ! Thanks a lot, and congrats to the all team !</strong> -- Stephane RD<br /> Thank you for joining us. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="ab03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961958"> </div>
<p><strong>Are these functionalities available only from Orlando release ? Is this available in NewYork Release?</strong> -- Santhamani Babu<br /> The Now Platform CI/CD functionality is new to Orlando. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="ab03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961963"> </div>
<p><strong>In creating multiple Instance, will all of theses be change to the customers?</strong> -- Elvis Edinge<br /> I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand the question. If you like, please provide context/details in the community comments. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="af03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961960"> </div>
<p><strong>Is this feature available to previous NewYork release?</strong> -- Ramesh Chandra<br /> Now Platform CI/CD is new to Orlando and higher. It is not back ported to previous releases. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="d703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961952"> </div>
<p><strong>Hi! Thanks for this demo! Really exciting. Do you guys have support for MID Server now with this app? Our enterprise code cannot be put on the public GIT Hub, so wondering if we have an integration through MID Server to connect to our enterprise git repo. Also, is this paid app?</strong> -- Nithu Warrier<br /> Hey Nithu, thanks for your question check out the bottom of this page: https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub-store-spokes/concept/cicd-spoke.html#d497981e515 | Unfortunately I don&#39;t have pricing specifics at this time, but INtegration Hub does require additional licensing. -- Jeremy Duncan<br /><br /></p>
<div id="db03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96194f"> </div>
<p><strong>In the Commit files screen, The upadate set column showing as &#34;Neha (%2B1)&#34; What does (%2B1) mean?</strong> -- Pavan Devineni<br /> I missed that. Can you provide a time code and where you saw that on the screen in the comments? -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="df03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96194c"> </div>
<p><strong>What module do I need to get deployment request flow in my instance</strong> -- Frank Moura<br /> Flow Designer is available from Kingston onward. you don&#39;t need to request anything to get that. To get the Now Platform CI/CD stuff activated, you need to be on Orlando and have the IntegrationHub Starter Pack installed - that&#39;s free. If it&#39;s not activated, reach out to customer support. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="e303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961955"> </div>
<p><strong>How do you correct update set errors if they arise with the new CI / CD functionality?</strong> -- Jeremiah Abot<br /> None of this is using update sets. It&#39;s all done with the app repo to push the changes. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="e303a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961960"> </div>
<p><strong>Does the tool support backwards compatibility of extensions with SN product upgrades?</strong> -- Gail Bickerstaffe<br /> If I understand the question, yes. You can take existing SN applications like HR, CSM, etc and extend them, then deploy your changes using the new Now Platform CI/CD products. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="e703a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195d"> </div>
<p><strong>Does Flow Designer and Jenkins do the same things? What scenarios warrant using solutions like Jenkins instead of Flow Designer</strong> -- Jeppu Sharath K<br /> They are both using the same underlying APIs. Jenkins might be handy for organizations that already have their CI/CD pipeline working with that tool or they want to trigger off something like a GitHub webhook (not currently available, but we&#39;re looking at adding Web API triggers to Flow.) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="eb03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b96195a"> </div>
<p><strong>Can we leverage the source control and CI/CD flow for the script(s), components and packages created in global?</strong> -- Yash Kedia<br /> Currently you can use these features (save source control) with a global scoped app, but not a native global app. See the docs if you&#39;re interested in setting a global scoped app. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="eb03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961965"> </div>
<p><strong>What is the licensing\cost modal for this?</strong> -- Anand Cherukuri<br /> Now Platform CI/CD is currently included with the IntegrationHub Starter Pack which is free. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="ef03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961957"> </div>
<p><strong>Maybe I missed the answer but I would like to know if this flow comes with the application or if it was created only for the demo?</strong> -- Ricardo Souza<br /> This flow he is showing was built for this demo and will be available on the share page of the developer portal and GitHub. We&#39;ll provide links in the YouTube description and community post in a couple days. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
<div id="ef03a52bdbebc4503d47eb184b961962"> </div>
<p><strong>Does this work with Microsoft Teams?</strong> -- Neji Tawo<br /> Yes. We do have an MS-Teams spoke (collection of actions) available for IntegrationHub that works with Flow Designer. Check with your account team on pricing. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /></p>
