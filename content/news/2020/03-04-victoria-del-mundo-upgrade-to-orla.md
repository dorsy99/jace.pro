<h3>Upgrade to Orlando to unlock the power of AI and Analytics</h3>
<p><em>Five steps to achieve upgrade success</em></p>
<p>We are excited that the Now Platform Orlando family release is now available to all customer around the world!</p>
<p>The Now Platform Orlando release delivers a rich set of Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities and analytics. <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;72f465fddb3604985ed4a851ca96195d" rel="nofollow">See Orlando release blog here</a></p>
<p>What’s great is that many of these new products, features and innovations are already part of the products that you already own which you can get when you upgrade to the Orlando family release!</p>
<p>Let’s get you ready to upgrade. Here are five key steps to help you achieve Orlando upgrade success:</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Step 1: Review what’s new in Orlando</h4>
<p>Take a second to review all the new innovations and features that tap the power of AI and analytics from the Orlando family release. Use the <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_article&amp;sys_id&#61;726a16f4dbba8c18d82ffb24399619dc" rel="nofollow">Orlando release Fact Sheet</a> which highlights what’s in the release notes. This will let easily present the information to your stakeholders to build a business case to upgrade.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Review your upgradeability with HealthScan</h4>
<p>Scan your instance health with the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/services/optimization-services.html" rel="nofollow">HealthScan</a> tool to get more visibility and insight to not only understand any risk but also prepare for your upgrades. Take a close look at the extent of any customization you have – is all of it needed, or can you trim some it back to reduce the number of skipped changes in your upgrade?</p>
<h4>Step 3: Check out ServiceNow’s upgrade resources and build an upgrade plan</h4>
<p>ServiceNow has tools, solutions and services to help customers upgrade to the latest version.  Use this Orlando pocket guide posted on this blog community page to learn more about these resources. Then create a viable upgrade plan. Be sure treat your upgrade like a formal project, so your time, resources, and costs are visible to everyone.</p>
<h4>Step 4: Schedule your upgrades</h4>
<p>Go to the HI Service Portal to schedule your upgrades. Use the new <em>HI Upgrade Wizard</em>’s step by step guide to show you how to schedule upgrades. Or better yet, if you qualify, sign up for the <em>HI Upgrade Assist</em> service so that we can automatically schedule upgrades for you.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Test and Upgrade</h4>
<p>Testing for software upgrades is critical. It is important that you create test plans before you upgrade to standardize on the process and ensure everything will work smoothly. ServiceNow’s <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/success.html" rel="nofollow">Customer Success Center</a> is a great resource for best practices and prescriptive recommendations to help you simplify and efficiently upgrade as well as reduce risk. Finally, when ready, go ahead and upgrade!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Did you know that customers who regularly upgrade have been able to</p>
<ul><li>increase productivity, efficiently minimizing the number of resources involved in an upgrade by as much as one or two individuals</li><li>speed time to value, reducing upgrade times from months to weeks</li><li>minimize risk, decreasing the number of internal ServiceNow help desk tickets</li></ul>
