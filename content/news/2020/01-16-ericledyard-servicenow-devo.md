<p><strong><em>Welcome to Episode 5 of our DevOps Podcast Series!</em></strong></p>
<p>In this episode, we sit down with Mike Wolf and discuss all things DevOps and Agile transformations. He shares many nuggets of wisdom and some of his current IP for helping companies with their transformations. His latest approach of: “Think like a startup, behave like a software company, and work like an Enterprise” encompasses the complexity of adopting DevOps at scale. Mike delivers one of the best quotes I have heard about DevOps: “Make it easy for developers to do the right thing.”</p>
