<p>In addition, below is a curated list of the top 5 items our HR customers might not already be aware of from the blog or the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-release-notes/page/release-notes/hr-service-delivery/hr-service-delivery-rn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Orlando release notes</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Case &amp; Knowledge Management</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Configure COE Security Policies</strong> <br />A new COE ACL Configuration page is now accessible from the left filter navigator. This allows HR Admins to easily configure Access Control Lists (ACLs) to allow groups read or write access to HR cases within COEs. For example, this simplifies the configuration process to allow only the HR Benefits group to view Benefits cases. This feature is an alternative to what was previously possible using ACL rules; it’s now a simple configuration process that uses forms and lists. Note that this does not impact a group’s ability to create a case; this determines what can be viewed or modified after case creation.</p>

<p><strong>Toggle All Centers of Excellence On or Off</strong> <br />In our Madrid release, additional Centers of Excellence (COEs) were added. As an HR Admin, you may now toggle the out-of-the-box COEs on or off for your organization by accessing the COE Configuration page from the left filter navigator. When you disable a COE, it no longer appears in left filter navigator and related HR services, topic details, topic categories, and record producers are also inactivated. Note that any custom COEs created by your organization will not appear here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Employee Service Center</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Reach Users with Short Message Service (SMS) or “Text” Notifications</strong> <br />You may now create and send SMS notification content to employees via a campaign or content delivery. To use this feature, your Administrator must configure notifications to work with an SMS service provider or <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-servicenow-platform/page/product/notify2/task/t_ConfigureNotifyWithTwilio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">configure Notify with a Twilio account</a> with Bulk SMS or Smart SMS options. When configuring an SMS notification, you have the ability to define a schedule to ensure delivery during business hours. <br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Note: in accordance with regulations in the CTIA Short Code Monitoring Handbook, users must be able to opt-out of receiving text messages. See our <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-servicenow-platform/page/product/notify2/task/opt-out-requests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">configure SMS opt-out preferences documentation</a> for more information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>NOW Platform</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Reusable Topic Blocks for Virtual Agent</strong><br />Create reusable topic blocks to perform common functions in Virtual Agent conversations without code. As an HR customer, there are now pre-built topics for creating an HR case and updating an HR case. There are also general topic blocks for transferring to a live agent, prompting survey completion, and providing relevant knowledge using contextual search.</p>

After you&#39;ve identified the customization level, you can also check the code in each widget in a variety of ways, including comparing against the base system.</p>
