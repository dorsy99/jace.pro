<p class="p3"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">What is an Application Specialist?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;">An Application Specialist has advanced knowledge of the base system and application of specialty. Application Specialists are master users and can implement the application complying with common ServiceNow application designs and technical best practices, meeting the customer’s business requirements. Application Specialists are able to troubleshoot problems related to the performance of the application and have a deep understanding of the customer’s processes and how to achieve results. They also understand the roles of the different application personas and are highly knowledgeable about platform configuration principles that maximize supportability, maintainability, and upgradability for long-term customer success. An awareness of how changes made to core products affect other areas/scopes in the platform is a critical skill, as is mentoring others through the process of becoming an application specialist.</span></p>
