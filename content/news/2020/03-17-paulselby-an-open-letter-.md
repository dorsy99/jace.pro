<p>It&#39;s an understatement to say we are living in interesting times. Now declared a pandemic, the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">novel coronavirus COVID-19</a> is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-update-03-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">impacting everyone&#39;s lives</a>. A visit to any grocery or drug store illustrates the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-toilet-paper-panic-buying-covid-19-uk-australia-a9403351.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">panic buying</a> taking place as worried consumers stock-up. Every check of the inbox brings new <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/email-communication-during-covid-19-tips-and-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">COVID-19 emails</a> from companies assuring their customers of the precautions they are taking. &#34;Social distancing,&#34; with its <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">many considerations</a>, is a new concept we should all be practicing. And in an attempt to combat the spread of the virus, countries have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/travel/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">restricted travel</a> and <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/spain-france-quarantine-lockdown-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">imposed quarantines</a>.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, things are not normal out there. Lives will continue to change in the near term but life also must go on, and in our daily lives we are both customers and representatives of a business in some manner. During this difficult time in our roles as <strong><em>customers</em></strong> and <strong><em>companies</em></strong>, we must work together to get through it–and that includes how we interact in the realm of customer service.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Start with patience, kindness, and understanding</h2>
<p><strong><em>Companies</em></strong>, behind the scenes you are undoubtedly doing everything you can to address and mitigate the higher volume you might be experiencing as a result of COVID-19 with what resources you can muster. For hard-hit businesses, set expectations on customer service telephone lines and provide updates on websites, such as this notice on the <a href="https://www.aa.com/homePage.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">American Airlines website</a>:</p>
<div class="wp-block-group">
<div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Our phones are busy.</strong> We understand it’s frustrating to wait, but if you’re not traveling in the next 72 hours, please wait until closer to your trip to call. You can cancel your flight online now and call when you’re ready to rebook. Please contact your travel agent for help if you didn&#39;t book directly with us.</em></p>

<p>Assure customers they will be assisted as quickly as possible and allow them to leave voicemail messages, send emails, or use social media channels where they will receive future follow-up. Also consider <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/extenuating-circumstances-policy-activated-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">changing policies</a> in light of this extraordinary situation, as Airbnb has, to help reduce inquiries on certain topics. Know that even despite best efforts, some customers will still have unreasonable expectations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customers</em></strong>, know that contacting customer service–waiting on-hold or in the chat queue–is going to take longer, especially with hard-hit companies like <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/long-hold-times-american-delta-united-airlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">airlines</a>. Recognize that companies are doing their best to respond to everyone, but might be experiencing additional challenges like employees out sick or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-creating-huge-stressful-experiment-working-home/607945/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">piloting a hastily-started work from home program</a>. Remember there are other customers with issues (some much greater than yours) that also need assistance. When you do get in touch with someone (bearing in mind it could take hours or even days), continue to demonstrate that grace when the agent apologizes for the wait you experienced. In general, expect everything–be it ordering something or asking a simple question–to just take longer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Be resourceful</h2>
<p><strong><em>Companies</em></strong>, with increased customer service volumes and potentially fewer staff, now is the time to double-down on self-service. While not necessarily the best time to start something new, ensure what is in place–knowledge bases, chatbots, communities, and automation, for example–are all operating well and providing up-to-date information. If additional solutions can be added and supported by existing channels, do so. Remind customers waiting on telephone lines and in chat queues of these instantly-available resources.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customers</em></strong>, before you pick up the telephone, start your search for answers online. Most companies today have <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/the-three-megatrends-for-customer-service-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">listened to the trends</a> and offer a variety of self-service options. These tools are available around the clock and provide solutions to most common issues. When you use them, it provides a faster resolution and means you free up a live agent to address other issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Help others</h2>
<p><strong><em>Companies</em></strong>, now is the time to step up your service and really assist your customers in the ways only you can. This is not an opportunity to peddle your wares but instead to help keep society moving forward. Some companies have already answered this call, with examples such as:</p>
<ul><li>Zoom, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/03/13/zoom-video-coronavirus-eric-yuan-schools/#4fcb4cba4e71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">providing its free videoconferencing software to temporarily closed K-12 schools</a></li><li>AT&amp;T, Charter, CenturyLink, Comcast, Cox, Sonic, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178451/fcc-coronavirus-keep-americans-connected-pledge-att-comcast-charter-att" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">offering assistance in various forms</a>, including suspending broadband data caps, raising internet speeds, and waiving late fees for customers and small businesses</li><li>Disney, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/walt-disney-company-bringing-frozen-2-disney-three-months-early-1284637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">releasing Frozen 2 on its Disney&#43; streaming service early</a> &#34;for families during these challenging times&#34;</li><li>ServiceNow, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/servicenow-free-access-apps-coronavirus-crisis-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">giving government agencies free access to apps designed to help respond to the coronavirus</a></li><li>The New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/learning/coronavirus-resources-teaching-learning-and-thinking-critically.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">delivering free updates about the pandemic</a></li><li>Apple Card (in partnership with Goldman Sachs), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/14/21179926/apple-card-skip-march-payment-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">allowing customers to skip their March payment without interest charges</a></li><li>Grubhub, <a href="https://media.grubhub.com/media/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Grubhub-and-Major-Cities-Across-the-US-Launch-Economic-Relief-Effort-up-to-100-Million-for-Independent-Restaurants-and-Delivery-Partners-Impacted-by-COVID-19/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">announcing it will delay collecting fees</a> from some restaurants experiencing cash flow issues</li><li>Thinking Tree Spirits, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thinkingtreespirits/photos/a.660615797427430/1645168272305506/?type&#61;3&amp;theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">providing made-in-house hand sanitizer</a></li></ul>
<p><strong><em>Customers</em></strong>, realize these companies will be taking a hit in some form to provide these products and services to everyone in need. Take a moment now to thank them; and when the pandemic has passed, continue to support them. If you have the time and knowledge, help provide answers on companies&#39; online customer service communities. And don&#39;t forget to be helping out in your own community: consider <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/us/blood-supply-food-banks-coronavirus-iyw-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">donating blood</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-51821470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">volunteering to help others</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting through this together</h2>
<p>Pandemics have been an issue humans have contended with <a href="https://www.mphonline.org/worst-pandemics-in-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">throughout history</a>–and we have persevered! COVID-19 has already sparked debate on <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-future-economy-politics-f838d8f1-09e2-48cd-afa7-1481d2044e21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">what it might mean for the future</a>. While what was considered &#34;normal&#34; might never return to some parts of society, some new (and better) norms are likely to emerge. And despite the uncertainties that lie ahead, companies and their customers must recognize the unique period we&#39;re in, take a breath, and work our way through it together. Now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/how-to-wash-your-hands-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">go wash your hands</a>.</p>
