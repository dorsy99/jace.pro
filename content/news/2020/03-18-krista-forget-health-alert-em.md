<p>To help our HRSD customers who are on the front lines of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are introducing the Health Alert Employee Experience Pack—a blueprint for communicating with employees during a health crisis for fast engagement without writing code.</p>
<p>Using the example of the COVID-19/Coronavirus, the Health Alert Employee Experience Pack offers an implementation accelerator for the Employee Service Center. It leverages out of box capabilities including pre-configured automated communication flows and sample content to quickly support employees during this crisis. This Experience Pack is available to ServiceNow HR Service Delivery customers with entitlements to the Employee Service Center. </p>
<p>Organizations will be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Deliver targeted communications to employees across channels</li><li>Provide relevant self-help based on criteria like employee location, department, or job role.</li><li>Assign To-Dos based on employee profiles  </li><li>Enable employees to request help when they need it</li></ol>

<h3>Deliver targeted communications to employees</h3>
<p>The Targeted Content Automation and Content Delivery features (aka Campaigns) enable you to proactively communicate with employees through multiple channels.</p>
<p>This Employee Experience Pack comes with a pre-configured Campaign and sample content that delivers information on the Employee Service Center, as To-Dos, and in email communications.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>A Welcome Banner points employees to a Company Updates sample Knowledge article and a Video announcement keeps employees informed from health authorities in their portal.</p>
<p>For customers on New York or later, we’ve provided additional pre-configured banners using the new Styled Content widget for greater flexibility that can be easily swapped out or added to the Campaign with a few configuration steps.</p>
<p>The Email from the Campaign notifies employees about the important updates that are available to them, linking them back to the Employee Service Center.</p>

<p>You can also use the Audience in your campaign settings to further target communications to different segments of employees.</p>
<h3><br />Provide relevant self-help resources based on employee location and other parameters  </h3>
<p>A set of sample Knowledge articles including Knowledge blocks is delivered in this Employee Experience Pack as an example of topics you may want to cover as self-help resources for various audiences and segments in your company.</p>
<p>The topic samples include:</p>
<ul><li>Company updates about COVID-19/Coronavirus</li><li>COVID-19 FAQs</li><li>Leading remote teams (for Managers)</li></ul>
<p>Knowledge Blocks are embedded in the Company updates sample Knowledge article and can be used in other articles or refined for specific audiences using HR Criteria. A few examples of refined audiences you could further configure this content for might be:</p>
<ul><li>Specific locations or countries</li><li>People managers</li><li>Employees who travel frequently such as Sales</li></ul>

<h3>Assign To-Dos based on employee profiles  </h3>
