<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Continuous improvement is an ongoing process to improve the process, services, people, or products of an organization. Continuous improvement business strategy is also known as a continuous improvement process (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CIP</a>) or Continual Service Improvement (<a href="https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-certifications/itil-intermediate-level/continual-service-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CSI</a>). The improvements sought can be incremental over time or achieved with a breakthrough moment that tries to increase effectiveness and efficiencies to fulfill a company’s objectives.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In IT Service and Operation Management, delivery of key services with high availability, low cost, and high customer satisfaction are becoming key success metrics for CIOs strategy. The Services are delivered by a set of steps, called processes, and there is always room for improvement in the delivery of process and people involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In recent years, many companies have begun to make greater use of the creative potential in the minds of their employees and customers using <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/continual-improvement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Continual Improvement Management</a> (CIM). The continuous improvement process plays an increasingly important role in the company because it allows to proactively drive continuous optimization across people/process/service/technology to increase business efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage.</span></p>
<h3><br />Benefits of using a continuous improvement business strategy</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When constantly seeking improvement and evaluating the process, you find out areas of bottlenecks, inefficiencies, waste that were not part of the focus earlier. What happens as a result is a continuous reduction in operating overhead, saved time and money as you start to optimize different areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When you can find out whether process inefficiencies are likely to cause delays or outages, you can plan better and make proactive improvements to avoid those mishaps. You’re open to taking advantage of opportunities. This constant movement, if it’s tethered to a well-thought-out process, will reduce complacency and threats from the competition and will help make your company more innovative.</span></p>
<h3>How to know when to apply a continuous improvement business strategy?</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you’re looking to save time and cost but keep up the quality of the product with great customer satisfaction, then a continuous improvement business strategy is a good way to manage that difficult balancing act. By looking for opportunities to improve business and then evaluating those changes, help form an effective strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some organizations are not set up to have their teams constantly practicing continuous improvement, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t take advantage of this useful strategy. For example, companies can schedule regular meetings to discuss ways to improve processes or enable the idea management module to let employees submit their improvement ideas at one single place for tracking and transparency. This will provide the feeling of being heard and needed, which has a significant influence on employee satisfaction and motivation.</span></p>
