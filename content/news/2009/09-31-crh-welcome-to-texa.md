<p>I am Carolyn Hollingsworth and have volunteered to help get our Texas user group started. I have been involved with user groups throughout my business career and have always found value both personally and for my company by actively participation.<br />This group is your group and I am here to help facilitate your requests. I would like to hear from all of you as to what value you are looking for.<br />Being new to Service-Now, I am looking to see what the rest of the group have done to extend Service-Now in your organization.<br />Please post your ideas for our first meeting being scheduled for November.<br />Watch for further details.<br />Carolyn Hollingsworth<br />Lennox International</p>
