You could consult with the SNMP Guru (at right). Or you could do some reading, online and on paper. <br /><br />Here are some of my favorite sources of SNMP information:<!--break--><br /><ul><li><b>Essential SNMP (book)</b>: My favorite overall reference to SNMP, by Doug Mauro and Kevin Schmidt, published by O'Reilly (<a title="w.amazon.com/Essential-SNMP-Second-Douglas-Mauro/dp/0596008406/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232633322&sr=1-1" href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-SNMP-Second-Douglas-Mauro/dp/0596008406/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1232633322&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon page</a>). The first edition of this book is what I used to learn how SNMP works; the second (and current) edition is even better.</li><li><b>SNMP MIB Handbook (book)</b>: This is a fairly new book by Larry Walsh, published by Wyndham Press (<a title="w.amazon.com/SNMP-MIB-Handbook-Larry-Walsh/dp/0981492207/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232633322&sr=1-2" href="http://www.amazon.com/SNMP-MIB-Handbook-Larry-Walsh/dp/0981492207/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1232633322&amp;sr=1-2">Amazon page</a>). It's full of rich detail about MIBs — how to make them, how to find them, how to use them. It's a little pricey, but it can save you a lot of time if you have to work with MIBs often.</li><li><b>OID Repository (web site)</b>: This <a title="w.oid-info.com/" href="http://www.oid-info.com/">site</a> does just one thing, and it does it very well: it lets you enter an OID (like "1.3.6.1.2.1.4.1") and instantly get the MIB name (like "iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ip.ipForwarding") and the description. The information is all derived from the MIB. The site seems to have all the non-proprietary MIBs, and many proprietary ones as well. Plus you can upload new MIBs for them to consider adding.</li><li><b>MIB Depot (web site)</b>: This <a title="w.mibdepot.com/index.shtml" href="http://www.mibdepot.com/index.shtml">site</a> has thousands of MIBs available for you to browse through and download. Very handy if you need access to MIBs for your network management tools, or if you're building custom probes and sensors for Discovery. Like the OID Repository, this site will also let you upload new MIBs if you'd like to contribute them to the community.</li><li><b>Wikipedia SNMP page (web site)</b>: As it often is, the <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Snmp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snmp">Wikipedia page</a> is a good introduction and a linkapalooza — it has dozens of good links off to other SNMP reference material.</li><li><b>Cisco SNMP Object Browser (web site)</b>: This <a title="ols.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseOID.do?local=en&substep=2&translate=Translate&tree=NO" href="http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseOID.do?local=en&amp;substep=2&amp;translate=Translate&amp;tree=NO">site</a> is a handy little web application that lets you browse the OID hierarchy, much like the OID Repository. However, this site has <i>all</i> of Cisco's many, many proprietary MIBs, and they're up-to-date.</li></ul><br /><br />Enjoy! And say "hi" to the guru for me...</p>
