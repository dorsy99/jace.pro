<p>I wasn't able to attend but I heard from numerous sources that the first Service-now.com New York City Local User Group meeting was a great success. <br /><br />More than 30 participants were in attendance to hear and discuss presentations on modern IT service management. Presenters included good folks from JBC Group, Artio Global Investors, AllianceBernstein and Service-now.com.<br /><br />[flickr-photo:id=4187479369,size=-]<br /><br />Thank you to Ellen and CBS for hosting the event. Let's start planning the next one.</p>
