<p>In case you aren't a member of the Virtual user group I wanted to give you a heads up. If you look in the right sidebar of this community site, you'll see an upcoming event where a Service-Now instance is shown off and attendees are given the option to ask questions and participate.<br /><br />Join the virtual user group if you want a demo of an instance!<br /><br />If you have questions, feel free to contact me matt (dot) beran (at) ammd (dot) com</p>
