<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="cb13bc82db589344e9737a9e0f96198c.iix" style="width: auto; height: 194px;" />What value will the following script print in the log?<br /><div style="margin-left:30px;font-family:Courier;"><br />var a = 'snake 31';<br />var b = /[0-9]+/.exec(a);<br />b += 2;<br />gs.log(b);<br /></div><br />Open this post to get the answer...<!--break--><br /><br />The answer is: 312.<br /><br />The first tricky bit is the <a title="w.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp" href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp">regular expression</a> in the second line. This simply extracts the number from from the variable "a", and returns a 31. But...the value stored in "b" is a <i>string</i>, not a number.<br /><br />The second part that might trip you up is the addition in the third line. This simply concatenates the string "31" (in variable "b") with a 2. JavaScript converts the number 2 into the string "2" to do this, but only because the value in "b" is a string. If what you really wanted was to add the <i>number</i> 31 to the number 2 (to get 33), this script would accomplish that: <br /><div style="margin-left:30px;font-family:Courier;"><br />var a = 'snake 31';<br />var b = parseInt(/[0-9]+/.exec(a));<br />b += 2;<br />gs.log(b);<br /></div></p>
