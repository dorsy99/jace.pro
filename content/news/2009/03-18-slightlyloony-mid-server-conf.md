Until this release the only way you could examine or modify the MID server configuration was to manually edit the config.xml file located on the box hosting the MID server. To add to the inconvenience, the format of the default config.xml file was a bit cryptic (I'm being polite), and none of the configuration parameters were documented.<br /><br />So it wasn't too difficult to find ways to improve the situation!<!--break--><br /><br />First thing we did was to create a default config.xml file that includes all the common parameters and excludes all the stranger ones. We added comments to explain what those parameters are for, and we commented out the optional parameters (so you can just uncomment them to use them). We even grouped the required parameters together, right at the beginning, to make your life easier.<br /><br />Second thing we did was to create a new table that shows up as a related list on the MID server form. This table lists all the configuration parameters on your MID server as they were set when the MID server was last started. Best of all, you can add, delete, and modify these parameters — right there in your web browser! — and those changes will be transmitted to the MID server. The MID server will then rewrite its own config.xml file to match what you've done. We've even protected you against accidental changes that might prevent your MID server from communicating with your Service-now instance. For example, if you try to change the URL parameter (which tells the MID server how to talk to your instance), the application will say "No, no no! You shan't do that!" and refuse to cooperate.<br /><br />Finally, we've documented the <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=MID_Server_Configuration" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=MID_Server_Configuration">whole darned thing</a>.</p>
