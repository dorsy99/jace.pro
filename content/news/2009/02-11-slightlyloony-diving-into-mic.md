Start by navigating to the CI's form, as I've done on the Windows Server at right (the screenshot shows only the Installed Software list, using the new tabs feature for related lists). I've filtered the list to show only those items related to SQL.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="9e6ee3b9db94df04e9737a9e0f9619bd.iix" style="width: auto; height: 61px;" />Next, drill into the software item you want to look at the license for. Here I've drilled into the Microsoft SQL installed on this server. In the related list below, you can see that there's a license for this software package.<br /><br /><img __jive_id="4761" alt="" class="jive-image" src="onafter.jpg" style="width: auto; height: 106px;" />Finally, drill into that license. You'll see a form like the one at right — including that Microsoft Product ID!<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="3da9ac42db94dfc03eb27a9e0f9619b6.iix" style="width: auto; height: 71px;" />Now that may or may not be the way you'd like to find your software licenses. As always, there are many other ways to look at anything in a table. Just as one example, the next thing I did was make an Application Module (in the <b>Configuration</b> application) to show all the Microsoft software licenses. At left is a screenshot of the module I created. <br /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="7f7b4082db509fc068c1fb651f96195b.iix" style="width: auto; height: 89px;" />And at right is a screenshot of the results, including those Microsoft Product IDs in list form.<br /><br />Shankar, let me know if I left anything unanswered.</p>
