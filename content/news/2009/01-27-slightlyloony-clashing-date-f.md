Mad Max (at right) just looked at the times for the MID server that explores his office, and you can see how happy he is about that!<br /><br />These crazy-looking dates are caused by a clash between what the MID server <i>thinks</i> the right date format is and what your Service-now instance is actually using. Fortunately there's an easy solution for this...<!--break--><br /><br />All you have to do is to tell your MID servers about the date format that you're using on your Service-now instance. You do this by adding a particular parameter to your MID server's configuration file: the <i>instance.date.format</i> parameter, with a value equal to the Java <a title="va.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">SimpleDateFormat date and time pattern</a> (<a title="va.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/format/simpleDateFormat.html" href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/format/simpleDateFormat.html">tutorial here</a>) that matches the date format on your instance.<br /><br />For example, suppose your Service-now instance was configured to use dates/times like "6-12-2009 9:34 am" or "11-2-2009 11:03 pm". The SimpleDateFormat time and date pattern that matches that format is <i>M-d-yyyy K:mm a</i>. To add this as a parameter to your MID server, just edit the <b><tt>config.xml</tt></b> file (in the directory where you've installed your MID server) to add this line:<br /><br /><br /><br />You can put that line just before or after any other parameter line; the order of the lines doesn't matter. Then restart your MID server and <i>voila!</i> — your date clashes are a thing of the past!</p>
