<p>We're looking for someone to host a show and tell of their Service-Now instance. This is an extremely productive, informal way for admins and users around the country to get ideas or garner feedback and generally collaborate on ideas and best practices!<br /><br />Think of this like a virtual local user group meeting.<br /><br />That being said, PM, reply or send me an e-mail (matt dot beran at ammd dot com) if you'd like to participate, contribute or attend. We have no volunteers for presenting yet, so as soon as we have one we'll schedule this!</p>
