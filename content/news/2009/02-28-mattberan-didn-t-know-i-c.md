<p>So here's what I want in our Service-Now instance:<br /><br />1) A testing checklist- routine procedures to follow through before implementing changes (from new release to adding a field)<br />2) stamp/title reports with dynamic info like report name is "Current_Date, (-1)"<br />3) export numbers from reports and not the report itself - (e.g. total tickets yesterday)<br />4) auto export multiple reports in one e-mail<br />5) Better reporting overall - I need to be able to do everything I keep doing in Excel in ServNowCom<br /><br />One of my big projects with deadline Q3 is to update our Category and Subcategory fields to more useful information. The reporting changes are going to kill me and the stuff above would really help too...</p>
