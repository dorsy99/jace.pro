<p>Dear Service Now Insert/Modify image, and I don't like it.<br /><br />I want a simpler solution to building documentation in Service Now. Similar to sharepoint where OLE pasting screenshots is possible.<br /><br />My current workaround is to attach a word doc or pdf to a KB article and paste the entire text into the meta field for searching. The downside to this is that my users don't get a preview of what the document contains, and it's slow.<br /><br />The positives are that it's easy for me to build docs quickly and get them posted, and I can switch to another knowledge vendor quite easily.<br /><br />Is anyone else doing this differently? Is there a faster way and I'm just clueless?</p>
