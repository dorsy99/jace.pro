<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="8e8a204edbd4d704ed6af3231f961999.iix" style="width: auto; height: 212px;" />Continuing yesterday's theme — several folks have asked me where they can go to learn more about JavaScript, which the Service-now product uses extensively, both on the instance and on the web browser client. Almost anything you might like to customize in Discovery requires knowledge of JavaScript: business rules, sensors, CI consolidation, etc. all make use of it. It's a key bit of knowledge to have under your belt if you want to be able to tweak and extend Service-now's products (including Discovery) to meet your organization's special needs. You <i>could</i> hire the JavaScript Genius at right (I understand he's available immediately). Or you could tackle this new challenge yourself, by doing some reading, online and on paper. <br /><br />Here are some of my favorite sources of JavaScript information:<!--break--><br /><ul><li><b>JavaScript: the Definitive Guide (book)</b>: In my not-so-humble opinion, this is the best overall reference to Javascript available. Written by David Flanagan, published by O'Reilly (<a title="w.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-David-Flanagan/dp/0596101996/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232718205&sr=1-1" href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-David-Flanagan/dp/0596101996/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1232718205&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon page</a>). This book is authoritative and unusually readable for such a reference. No other JavaScript book I own even comes close.</li><li><b>W3 Schools JavaScript Reference (web site)</b>: This <a title="w.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp" href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp">site</a> has a reasonably complete JavaScript reference that is quite concise. It's great for a quick lookup of some obscure point of the language you don't use often. My only complaint is that in its conciseness it leaves out some useful details.</li><li><b>Web Reference's Core JavaScript Reference (web site)</b>: This <a title="w.webreference.com/javascript/reference/core_ref/contents.html" href="http://www.webreference.com/javascript/reference/core_ref/contents.html">site</a> is a more complete JavaScript reference and includes an index. It's not quite as easy to navigate as the preceding site.</li><li><b>Wikipedia JavaScript page (web site)</b>: As it often is, the <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Wikipedia page</a> is a good introduction and a linkapalooza — it has dozens of good links off to other JavaScript reference material, along with some interesting JavaScript history.</li><li><b>Mozilla's JavaScript Reference (web site)</b>: This <a title="eveloper.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript">site</a> is the most complete of all, albeit specifically for the flavor of JavaScript found in the FireFox web browser and other Mozilla products. I find it useful both for researching FireFox-specific information and for JavaScript in general, as the site does a good job of pointing out the non-standard Mozilla behaviors.</li></ul><br /><br />Enjoy! And let me know if you end up hiring the genius...</p>
