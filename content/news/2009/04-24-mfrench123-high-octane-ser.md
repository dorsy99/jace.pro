Nine FPA graduates have progressed to Formula One, with many more racing in premier international championships such as the IRL, DTM, Japanese Super GT, British Touring Cars, Le Mans Series and the FIA WTCC.<br /><br />All cars in the championship are owned, prepared and run by the FPA team, which operates from 30,000sq ft workshops at its own test circuit, Bedford Autodrome. Every car is prepared to the same standard by a highly experienced team, ensuring absolute equality of equipment for all drivers and providing the unique level playing field that has provided the springboard for so many talented drivers. <br /><br />With equality of machinery assured, the racing is close and there is plenty of overtaking. The cars have 300bhp from a 1.8-litre turbocharged Audi engine, which also incorporates an overboost feature that increases power to 360bhp for an eight second burst. On the push of a button, each driver can call upon extra power to help complete a pass, or defend a challenge.<br /><br />Since 2003, at least one FPA driver per year has been selected as a finalist in the prestigious McLaren Autosport BRDC Award. The category produced its first winner of the award in 2007, when championship runner-up Stefan Wilson triumphed, underlining the high standard of drivers competing in FPA.<br /><br /><b>About the Driver:</b><br />Briton Ashley Babbra finished a highly commendable third place in his debut season of single seater racing in the Formul' Academy Euro Series. In the 14 race campaign, Babbra secured one victory, one pole position, five podiums and one fastest lap in the championship's inaugural series. <br /><br />Babbra secured victory at the tricky street circuit of Pau and was consistently challenging for wins throughout the season, with two of his podiums coming at the tricky Brno circuit. <br />2009 will see Babbra hoping to secure the prize of top rookie in FPA. <br /><br /><b>Race Calendar</b><br />•May 1 — 3: Brands Hatch (A1GP)<br />•June 6 — 7: Silvertone National<br />•July 24-25: Oulton Park<br />•August 22-23: Brands Hatch Indy<br />•October 3 — 4: Silverstone GP<br />•Oct 17 — 18: Snetterton</p>
