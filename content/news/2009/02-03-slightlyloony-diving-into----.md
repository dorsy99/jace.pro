Are there other topics (whether Discovery or on our overall product) that you'd like me to post on? Are there things you've always wondered how to do, or things you're looking for pointers and quick-starts on, or things you've wondered how they work? If so, please leave a comment here with your thoughts...<br /><br />Otherwise, you know, I'll just like <i>imagine</i> what you might want to hear about, and you're likely to get a post on slide rules, training dogs for agility, fires in the chaparral, or some other topic you really <i>didn't</i> want to know about!<br /><!--break--></p>
