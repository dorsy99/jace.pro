<p>Just checking to see if we can actually use this space to interface with each other and provide a space for a call for topics.<br /><br />I know one thing I'd like to see more knowledge management solutions, I know this was sort of covered, but I want to see how people are using this from a self-service portal perspective. One thing I'd really like to see is OLE enabled KB article editing, or a quick import feature from a standard format. This would stop me from just attaching word documents to KB's and copying the text into Meta to import from our other solutions.</p>
