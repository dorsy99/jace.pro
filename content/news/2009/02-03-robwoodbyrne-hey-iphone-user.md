<p><img __jive_id="6664" alt="iPhone icon" class="jive-image" style="width: imagecache/Medium/Rob Woodbyrne/iPhone.png; height: auto;" />If any of you out there use iPhones, you can add a very cool looking 'Service-now' icon to your iPhone Home Page which will let you get direct access to your Service-now instance through Safari! (Of course, this will only work if your security team has allowed access to your instance from outside your network)<br /><br />1. Launch Safari.<br />2. Navigate to a Service-now instance (example: http://demo.service-now.com)<br />3. Login<br />4. Click the '+' sign at the bottom of Safari<br />5. Select 'Add to Home Page'<br />6. Name it 'Service-now' (Anything longer will not display correctly)<br />7. Save it!<br /><br />Now you should have a nice looking Service-now icon on your iPhone! Why do we need laptops again??</p>
