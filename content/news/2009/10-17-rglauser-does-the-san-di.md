<p>This is kind of a cop out, and does not replace a regular Service-now.com user group meeting, but I thought many of the members of the Service-now.com Southern California user group would be interested in the details of the upcoming itSMF San Diego LIG. Service-now.com will be co-presenting with Alliant Insurance, a Service-now.com customer. Additional details and a registration link are provided below.<br /><br />While I have your attention, we are accepting nominations for a Service-now.com Southern California user group leader. In fact, do you guys think it would be a good idea to create a Los Angeles / Orange County group and a separate San Diego group? If so, we'll need leaders for both groups. Send an e-mail with your thoughts to rhett.glauser@service-now.com or post a comment to this thread.<br /><br /><a title="w.itsmfusa.org/eventlist?filter0=SANDGO_LIG&filter1=now&filter2=YYYY-MM-DD+HH%3AMM%3ASS" href="http://www.itsmfusa.org/eventlist?filter0=SANDGO_LIG&amp;filter1=now&amp;filter2=YYYY-MM-DD+HH%3AMM%3ASS">Register now for San Diego itSMF LIG Meeting</a> (To register, please log in or register as a guest to the itSMF site)<br />Date: Thursday, November 5, 2009<br />Time: 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm<br />Location:Gen-Probe Headquarters, 6333 Sequence Drive, San Diego, CA 9212<br />Cost: FREE (non-members welcome) food and beverage provided<br />Session details: <b>Flexibility - The Key to Buisness and IT Alignment</b>, Eric Kauffman, Alliant Insurance VP of software development; Brian Surritt, Service-now.com product marketing manager<br />Additional questions: sandiego@itsmf.net</p>
