It's got all sorts of spiffy new things, but here I'm going to focus on the Discovery enhancements and changes. Read the change notes for the entire release, and then read on here for details about the Discovery-related changes...<!--break--><br /><br />In no particular order: <ul><li><b>Mac support</b>: Discovery can now find and explore <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/12/4/1934" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=10ccee25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96193e">Mac OS/X workstations and servers</a>. The only prerequisite is that your Macs must have Remote Login (SSH) enabled.</li><li><b>Netware support</b>: Discovery can now find and explore <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/12/16/1942" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=92ec6e65dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619fc">Netware Servers</a>. The only prerequisite is that your Netware servers must have SNMP enabled.</li><li><b>UPS support</b>: Discovery can now find and explore network-manageable <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/11/18/1924" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9cfc62a5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961923">Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs)</a>.</li><li><b>Instance performance and reliability improvements</b>: Some of our customers are using Discovery to find and explore hundreds of thousands of devices each week. As their requirements have become more demanding, we've made many small improvements to the Service-now product to increase the speed and reliability of Discovery's operation.</li><li><b>MID server performance, reliability and manageability improvements</b>: Just as our customers' needs on the instance have increased, so have their needs for performance and reliability of MID servers. We've made many changes in this area, including automatic recovery from a MID server outage (picking right back up where it left off), better MID server resource management, and the ability to cancel a Discovery <i>including</i> all the current activity on MID servers. One new feature that you'll likely find especially welcome: MID servers now automatically upgrade themselves to the correct version at the same time your instance is upgraded.</li><li><b>Network Discovery</b>: Discovery can now automatically find all the IP networks in your enterprise, by exploring your network routers. The results of a network discovery is a collection of range sets, ready to add to Discovery schedules. If your enterprise has more than a few dozen IP networks, this new feature can save you a lot of work setting up and managing Discovery.</li><li><b>Discovery Behaviors</b>: These provide a way to use <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/11/17/1923" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=cf8de669dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619fa">specific MID servers for specific purposes</a>, such as using one MID server to handle Windows probes, another to handle SNMP probes, etc. Another feature of behaviors lets you easily deal with an otherwise difficult situation: computers in multiple Windows domains in a single Discovery range. With Discovery Behaviors, you can automatically send Windows probes to the MID server with the correct credentials for each individual Windows server or workstation.</li><li><b>CI Consolidation</b>: A <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/12/22/1946" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=336ceea1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961907">powerful new tool</a> for automatically handling a number of challenges that commonly arise when using Discovery to populate your CMDB, including mixing CMDB imports and Discovery, non-standard coalescing methods, and frequent IP address changes. There's much more detail <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Discovery_CI_Consolidation" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Discovery_CI_Consolidation">here</a>.</li><li><b>Technology improvements</b>: We've made lots of little improvements to Discovery's core technologies — SNMP is faster and more reliable, WMI can now explore any namespace, <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/11/20/1926" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9eac6625dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961919">chunky pings</a> makes discoveries faster and more responsive, <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/12/8/1936" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=275c6aa1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96197e">all serial numbers</a> are now available to you, there's a <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/12/3/1933" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=5d5e6aaddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96191f">spiffy new probe report</a>, and much, much more...</li></ul><br /><br />There's lots to like in this new release — give it a try, and let us know what you think about it...</p>
