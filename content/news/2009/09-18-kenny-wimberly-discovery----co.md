<p>I'm currently in a position with CompuCom where I manage the discovery module and the CMDB. At the request of SNC, I decided to throw up this blog to share my experiences with Discovery and hopefully evoke some much needed discussions regarding discovery nuances, tips, tricks, general ideas, and some pretty cool implementations...<br /><br />Anyway, my intent is to share and also participate in discussions regarding discovery and asset management. I hope that all of us that are involved with Discovery will choose to participate. I believe this is a great learning portal for that much needed information that we lack in documentation.</p>
