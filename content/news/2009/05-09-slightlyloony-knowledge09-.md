We code monkeys had the chance to meet and talk with quite a few of you who are already using Discovery (always fun for us!) as well even more of you who are seriously looking at Discovery. <!--break--><br /><br />While the Discovery lab was useful, it wasn't nearly long enough — there was just too much material to cover in 50 minutes. We're looking at ways to improve that for next year. Those of you who were there — what would you suggest we do differently?<br /><br />The best part for me was getting to meet several people who have dug very deeply into Discovery, and are doing some quite sophisticated things — using every bit of the flexibility and capability we worked so hard to build into the product. Very cool!</p>
