<p>I wanted to take a quick moment and thank again everyone who was able to attend yesterday and especially those from Navigator Management Partners for volunteering their office. In attendance were those from healthcare industry, higher education, insurance industry, law firms, valued strategic partners, and of course, Service-Now.com. <br /><br />I encourage everyone who was able to make it to send me some comments either through messaging here or by the contact information that was distributed at the event. We'll also be posting up some more information and suggestions for the next meeting slated in a few months for mid to late April.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Garrick Vance</p>
