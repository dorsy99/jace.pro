<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="30cc0dc6dbd41b04ed6af3231f96196d.iix" style="width: auto; height: 227px;" />Are you a command line maestro (like Captain Command Line at right)? Newbie? Whichever description fits you better, you'll almost certainly learn something interesting at <a title="w.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse/sort-by-votes" href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse/sort-by-votes">Command-line-fu</a>. This site lets anybody propose their favorite command line tricks, tips, and hacks â€” and then lets the whole community vote them up or down, and comment on them. If you use the command line every day, as I do, you'll find all sorts of clever and novel things here.<br /><br />For example,<!--break--> one thing I learned is a very fast way to correct a mis-typed command. For instance, suppose I accidentally typed:<br /><p style="font-family: Courier;margin-left:30px;"><b>$ cd /Users/SlightlyLoopy</b></p><br />Misspelled my own name! Rather than retype the entire thing, or up-arrow, backspace, and correct, I can simply enter:<br /><p style="font-family: Courier;margin-left:30px;"><b>$ ^p^n</b></p><br />This replaces any "p" characters in the previous command with "n" characters, and re-runs it. The two strings can be any length.<br /><br />Lots more geekly goodies at the link...</p>
