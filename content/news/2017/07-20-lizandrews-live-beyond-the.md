<p>A fascinating recent <a title="ww.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/sunday/why-the-future-is-always-on-your-mind.html?_r=0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/sunday/why-the-future-is-always-on-your-mind.html?_r=0">New York Times article</a> highlights our species' contemplation of the future as what sets us apart from others. The human ability to examine and re-examine data is unparalleled. And yet we humans are limited by the amount of information our brains can process at any given time, keeping future gazing fairly small and impotent in scope.</p><p></p><p>As the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, machine learning and other emerging technologies hold the promise of transcending the computational limits of our human brains. These tools can increase our visibility and can deliver clearer, more comprehensive insights about what is coming down the road.</p><p></p><p>The Performance Analytics Jakarta release has some exciting new capabilities that will help you do just this — harness extra computing power to supercharge your quest for better foresight. The Performance Analytics theme in Jakarta is to deliver easy access to data - to empower people at every level of the business to make more informed decisions and drive quicker resolutions. More data evaluated, delivering stronger insights… resulting in smarter decisions.</p><p></p><p>Let's break this new Jakarta capability down by spotlighting three key capabilities:</p><p></p><p><strong>Advanced forecasting</strong> — The Now Platform <a title="ww.servicenow.com/now-platform/intelligent-automation-engine.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/now-platform/intelligent-automation-engine.html">Intelligent Automation Engine</a> already leverages this Performance Analytics feature -- and with Jakarta you can too! — to deliver predictive trending based on advanced forecasting algorithms. Let ServiceNow do the heavy lifting of matching historical patterns against multiple algorithms to automatically determine the best fit forecast. You will even be notified if a preset target or threshold is approaching.</p><p><img   alt="Advanced Forecasting.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="18c611c2dbd81b04ed6af3231f961902.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 344px;"/></p><p><strong>Interactive analysis</strong> — You can also visually explore your data from any list simply by launching an interactive analysis. Right-click on any column of a list, move to a graphical view that allows you to select or filter out data, and stack and sort to see the data that is most important to you.</p><p><img   alt="Interactive Analysis.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="3f4f2482dbd8d704ed6af3231f96198c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 378px;"/></p><p><strong>Instant spreadsheet importing </strong>— You can now use the power of Performance Analytics on data generated outside of the Now Platform. It has never been easier to layer in important external data by stepping through a few logical import steps to incorporate any .xlsx content into a new or existing report.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Import.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="18701906db5897049c9ffb651f9619ed.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 340px;"/></p><p>These are just a few of the new Jakarta features to check out as you seek to supplement your humanoid powers of prospection with machine superpower for the good of your organization.</p><p></p><p>Visit the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=055c66a1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96198e">Jakarta Fact Sheet</a> to learn more about this new release!</p>
