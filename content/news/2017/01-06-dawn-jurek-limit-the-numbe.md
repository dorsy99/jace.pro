<p>As system administrator, you may find that your instance requires administration within various applications. The key is to delegate these tasks to other users. For example, Tom manages the Service Catalog, and Jane manages Reports; why not give each of them the privileges to take care of administrative tasks within these functions themselves? You pop into the user records for Tom and Jane, assign them both the admin role, and you're good to go, right? Not so fast. In this second installment of our best practices series, we look at <em>why</em> you should limit the number of users with this role.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>See <a title="Annotate scripts and customizations with comments" __default_attr="6326" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Annotate scripts and customizations with comments" data-renderedposition="94_308.484375_345_16" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=6f4da229dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619a8">Annotate scripts and customizations with comments</a> for the first installment on script comments.</em></p><p></p><h2>Why should you limit the number of users with the admin role?</h2><p>Users with the admin role have special privileges that automatically bypass most <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual-security/concept/access-control-rules.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual-security/concept/access-control-rules.html">access control list (ACL) rules</a>. This means that Tom and Jane could unknowingly wreak havoc just about anywhere in your instance.</p><p></p><p>Sure, it may make sense in development environments to grant the admin role extensively. But in production, a better approach is to grant administrative users one or more special administrative roles that are specific to the functions they perform. For example, the <strong>catalog_admin</strong> role grants privileges needed to manage the Service Catalog application, the report_admin role allows users to manage reports, and so forth.</p><p></p><h3>How do you figure out which role to grant?</h3><p>You could navigate to <strong>User Administration &gt; Roles </strong>and filter the list to display all roles related to the function. In the example below, we've filtered the list to display all catalog related roles. Or, if you can't find a role you need, you can always create your own role.</p><p><img   alt="user admin.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="0708c84adb581344e9737a9e0f9619d1.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 349px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Admin role best practice</strong></span></p><p>Limit the number of users with the admin role. Instead, assign special administrative roles. Limiting the number of users with the admin role is consistent with the <a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a> and helps ensure separation of duties.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Behind the scenes here at ServiceNow, the Knowledge Management team works closely with subject matter experts to disseminate critical information to our customers.
