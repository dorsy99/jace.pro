<p>If you're a ServiceNow customer (and I bet you are), you are either headlong into Service Portal development or else you soon will be - there isn't much middle ground. And for good reason! Service Portal offers unparalleled capabilities to create beautiful, responsive, branded user experiences on top of the powerful ServiceNow platform. Transformation from the ground up!</p><p></p><p>With this gaining momentum, there's an increased need for documentation, best practices, and leadership around Service Portal design and development. At Yansa Labs, we have a few SP deployments under our belt, and so I'd like to share with you the resources that we consistently revisit to help us build better Service Portals more efficiently.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="GIT1.png" class="image-2 jive-image" height="251" src="33c825c6db5053043eb27a9e0f96193d.iix" style="float: right; height: 251px; width: 427.746px;" width="428"/></p><h3>1) Service Portal GIT Documentation</h3><p></p><p>The team that built Service Portal maintains a fantastic 'unofficial' <a title="ithub.com/service-portal/documentation" href="https://github.com/service-portal/documentation">documentation source</a>. It provides great detail around the Service Portal framework and 'how stuff works'. Things like:</p><p></p><ul><li>Portal architecture</li><li>Client &amp; Server APIs</li><li>SASS/CSS support</li><li>Widget options, dependencies, etc (and what they mean)</li><li>Service catalog in SP</li></ul><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><h3><img   alt="YDS1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="268" src="efb97bf1db14d3041dcaf3231f9619e5.iix" style="float: right; width: 427px; height: 268.116px;" width="427"/></h3><h3></h3><h3>2) Yansa Design System</h3><p></p><p>Yansa Labs maintains the growing <a title="nsa.io/yds/" href="http://yansa.io/yds/">Yansa Design System</a>, a searchable &amp; interactive database of Service Portal components. This is where we come to test UI elements, learn how they work, and copy/paste the code into our Portals:</p><p></p><ul><li>Includes YDS-exclusive, recommended baseline, and best-of-breed Share components</li><li>Interact with elements to understand user experience</li><li>Understand available parameters &amp; options</li><li>View screenshots &amp; videos of widgets</li><li>Copy &amp; paste code snippets into your widgets</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="SLACK1.png" class="image-3 jive-image" height="237" src="30184d0adb1413043eb27a9e0f96193a.iix" style="float: right; width: 426px; height: 237.048px;" width="426"/></p><h3>3) Community &amp; SNDevs Slack Channel</h3><p></p><p>Sometimes you need something a little more interactive. In those times, we flock to the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=b029962ddbd897c068c1fb651f9619d7">ServiceNow Community</a> and the <a title="ndevs.slack.com/" href="https://sndevs.slack.com/">SNDevs Slack community</a>. Both contain a bevy of fellow developers anxious to help.</p><p></p><p>Be warned, though, you can lose the better part of a day perusing the channels and personalities that you'll find in the Slack channel. It's a fun group, but enter at your own risk! <span __jive_emoticon_name="happy" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="875.5625_372.59375_16_16" src="/8.0.4.21bdc7e/images/emoticons/happy.png"></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Or, heck, maybe you'd rather hire some professionals to assist. In that case, there are some great partners who would be happy to help. <a title="nsa.io/" href="http://yansa.io/">Yansa Labs</a> is one of them! Don't hesitate to email me at <a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:ben@yansa.io">ben@yansa.io</a> if you'd like to chat about your plans.</p>
