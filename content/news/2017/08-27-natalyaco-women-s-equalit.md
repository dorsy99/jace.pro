<p>Today is <a title="witter.com/search?q=%23WomensEqualityDay&src=tyah" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WomensEqualityDay&amp;src=tyah">Women's Equality Day</a>, which began as a way to honor the passage of the 19<sup>th</sup> Ammendment, and is now used to highlight women's efforts to gain equal footing in the world both socially and professionally. The inclusion of women in traditionally male-dominated fields (particularly in tech) has been discussed a lot in recent years, with viral hashtags like #ILookLikeAnEngineer and #WomenInTech drawing more attention to the effort.</p><p></p><p>To put the women in tech issue into perspective, let's try this exercise: when you envision a typical tech company, what comes to mind first? It probably wouldn't be far-fetched to guess that your initial thought is a group of young male developers wearing hoodies. ServiceNow is trying to change this perception by celebrating women who contribute so much to the tech industry, and encouraging others to explore their talents in this field as well.</p><p></p><p>ServiceNow is proud of the many women in our ecosystem who are challenging the status quo. To celebrate Women's Equality Day, we are highlighting two in particular â€” Britt Champeau and Kathi Honegger.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="6M4A7808.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="a7058482db9c5704ed6af3231f961906.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 413px;"/></p><p>When<strong> Britt Champeau</strong> was younger, she wanted to be a superhero. Now, working as Experience and Marketing Manager for ServiceNow's Champion Enablement program, she feels like she is one.</p><p></p><p>"Every woman who is successful in a male dominated industry is a "Wonder Woman." In fact, I tweeted that the other day."</p><p></p><p>Before she was a ServiceNow employee, Britt was a ServiceNow customer, starting a decade ago. "I've been using ServiceNow my whole adult life." Three years ago, when she saw a ServiceNow opening, she realized that even though she wasn't <em>technically</em> a tech person, she had all the required skills.</p><p></p><p>Britt loves her job, which includes talking to customers and "saving the day!" Her advice for girls and young women is not to accept the idea that Science and Math are only for boys. For women hoping to break into tech, Britt says the best way is to leverage knowledge experience that can start with tech writing and lead to more challenging tech positions.</p><p></p><p>Though she has no personal motto or mantra, during challenging times when she's being told that she can't do something, she repeats to herself over and over a short phrase that helps her stay the course: "We aim to rebel."</p><p></p><p><strong><img   alt="6M4A7795.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="4703e80adb50dfc03eb27a9e0f9619c6.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 413px;"/></strong></p><p><strong>Kathi Honegger</strong> is based at ServiceNow's head office in Santa Clara. Her education was in sports medicine, but she spent the early part of her career in office administration at legal offices. Over time she became the de facto "tech" person, who trained staff on the latest equipment and tools. Eventually, Kathi left the legal industry and transitioned into doing IT in the banking industry. She joined ServiceNow in May, 2016 as an IT Program Manager in Corporate IT.</p><p></p><p>Often the only woman in a room full of highly technical men, Kathi offers this advice: "Do not be afraid of asking questions. Don't be afraid to jump into something that you don't know. You'll learn. Too many people hold themselves back because they're afraid."</p><p></p><p>Britt and Kathi represent so many other talented women who are changing the face of tech. Do you know someone who is doing the same? Give her some props in the comments below!</p><p></p><p>ServiceNow is always looking for smart, driven women to join the team.
