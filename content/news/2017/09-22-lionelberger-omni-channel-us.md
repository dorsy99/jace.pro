You'll also find a <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/download/7225-149037/Mobile Development Framework v1.1.pdf">PDF attached to this article</a>, that provides more details on how to actually deliver an omni-channel experience on the ServiceNow platform.</p><p></p><p>Please contribute to this post by commenting your own experience with the subject.

The User Experience is not about the colors and pictures, it really focuses on the emotional, physical and visual experience users will feel throughout their "user journey".</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3334ca;">Omni-channel?</span></h1><p style="text-align: left;">Whether at work or at home, Employees, Customers and Suppliers expect a consistent experience. As they can initiate a chat on Facebook on their web-browser and continue the discussion on their mobile phone, they expect the same with their digital work place. The main different between Omni-channel and Multi-channel is to actually provide the same capabilities and ensure continuity when swapping from any device to another. Furthermore, the native capabilities of the device will be exploited in order to get the full value of that channel's experience.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;"><em>As an example, I may want to use the geo-location and camera of my phone to create a Task/Action, which I will work on later on while I'm back at my desk. In the meantime, I might want to have some social collaboration with colleagues to prepare the work for this task, which I will start on my phone and possible continue on a tablet or a desktop computer. I'll be expecting a seamless experience across the devices, providing consistent information and capabilities.</em></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">The key message here is that building Mobile Apps for the various use cases may not be a strategic move towards a consistent user experience. It is advised to think through all use cases and ensure that the experience expected on the go (mobile), at work (desktop) and at home (tablet?) is achieved in a consistent manner.</p><p>More about the omni-channel experience here: <a title="archcio.techtarget.com/definition/omnichannel" href="http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/omnichannel">http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/omnichannel</a></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   class="image-2 jive-image" src="8f6e3fbddb14db048c8ef4621f96196d.iix" style="max-width: 669px; max-height: 330px;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3334ca;">So how to do it ?</span></h1><p style="text-align: left;">There are a couple of options available, and the table below provides a high-level evaluation of their pros &amp; cons:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   class="image-3 jive-image" src="02766946db5cd304b322f4621f96191c.iix" style="max-width: 642px; max-height: 205px;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">The key recommendation is to consider the omni-channel requirements, hence opt for option #4 or #5:</p><ul><li>Ensure consistent experience and capabilities across desktop, tablet or mobile</li><li>Embed Service Portal pages within the mobile app</li><li>Use some JS code to hide features not required when Service Portal page is embedded in mobile app</li><li>Leverage mobile app (e.g. ServiceNow app) for use of push notifications</li><li>Develop custom mobile app specific capabilities for specific use cases only (e.g. offline approvals or Uber-like apps)</li></ul><p></p><p>It is also important to note that the ServiceNow mobile app evolves with every new release, and a number of the current limitations will be addressed soon. I would strongly recommend to get in touch with a ServiceNow person to get more details about this, which may influence your approach.</p><p></p><p>What about YOU?
