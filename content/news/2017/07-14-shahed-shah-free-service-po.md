<p>There are many people freely sharing Service Portal widgets on the <a title="Developer Share" href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ServiceNow Share</a>. If you haven&#39;t done it yet, stop trying to code your next widget and check if one already exists for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I have much love for the product and the community, I wanted to get in on the act too and share the love. So I&#39;m excited to share with you the <a title="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/share/contents/9330051_search_page_with_assistance?v&#61;2&amp;t&#61;PRODUCT_DETAILS" href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/share/contents/9330051_search_page_with_assistance?v&#61;2&amp;t&#61;PRODUCT_DETAILS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Search Page with Assistance</a> widget, which was created in response to <a title="" href="/community?id&#61;community_question&amp;sys_id&#61;7778cfeddb1cdbc01dcaf3231f96196e" rel="nofollow">this</a> discussion. Yup, I had a Barney Stinson moment (&#34;Challenge accepted!&#34;).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In short, this widget is a take on the OOB widget called Search Page, with one missing element... the &#34;Did you mean?&#34; suggestions. (Would it be naughty to say this is how the widget should&#39;ve been?)</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Just make sure you already have the behaviour enabled by setting the <strong>glide.ts.dym.enable_spell_correct</strong> and <strong>glide.ts.dym.enable_chain_suggest</strong> properties to <strong>true</strong>, then toggle the options for the widget.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Feel free to do what you want with it: use it, rip/change the code, or even shred it. It&#39;s yours now.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Updating links as the Share migrated into the Developers site.</p>
