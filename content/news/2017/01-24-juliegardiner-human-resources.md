<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">When employees contact HR, they speak in terms of lifecycle events and not HR services or departments. For example, having a baby is a lifecycle event, and that's how employees will describe it; however, from an HR perspective, that event gets translated into several HR services that need to be performed, including adding a dependent, taking maternity leave, benefit enrollment, changes to beneficiaries, etc. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">In Istanbul, we are introducing the concept of Lifecycle Events to manage these more complex HR service request. Each HR Service will be a reusable component that can be initiated via the Service Catalog or via a Lifecycle Event (parent case). For example, enrolling in medical benefits can be initiated during onboarding, having a baby, a marital status change, open enrollment, employee move, etc. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">This new Lifecycle Event Model will allow HR to define the case and task types related to lifecycle events, allowing for the reuse of standard case types.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">To better support the employee experience, the new model allows employees to engage with HR using lifecycle event terminology, rather than require them to search for all the different services that may be involved.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Istanbul delivers the structure for this new model; content will be made available out-of-the-box in upcoming releases.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">Please contact your account team to find out more information and schedule a demo to see all that is new in HR Service Management.</span></p>
