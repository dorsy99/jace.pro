<p>One more thing: the D1R as we call the the day-one readiness is implemented by our work stream Interfaces. D1R is supporting HR IT processes for entire Siemens organization in a sense of getting employees ready to work from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of their business life. Siemens FITS program is enabling this by offering smart Service Request bundles where for instance a manager can request an offboarding package in advance before the new bee is entering his department. In case the employee is moving from one region to another one, where different mobiles service providers, different hardware/software baskets or even IT infrastructure service variants are in place, a transfer package helps to get this things resolved and also makes this employee ready to work from the day 1!</p><p><img  class="image-1 jive-image" height="337" src="69f8b84adb9cdfc03eb27a9e0f9619de.iix" style="width: 383px; height: 337.296px;" width="383"/></p><p>CMDB is supporting this D1R process by offering all the necessary data from the new employees before their start. We are ensuing to receive the so called future data records from HR IT and synchronizing the user's data from our Siemens Corporate Directory on a daily base. </p><p>To enable enhanced data lifecycle we keep the so called historic user's entries one month longer in the system, w/o access rights to the self-service portal. But managers, sponsors or super-requester are able to cancel services from employees who left Siemens, in case this wasn't completed just before offboarding.</p>
