<p>ServiceNow Developer MeetUps have been swarming all cross the globe and finally we have some in India. For us, it all started off at Hyderabad on <strong>March 8th, 2017</strong>, when me and my colleagues witnessed the <strong>Developer Day</strong>. After catching up with folks like <a title="rao.surapaneni" __default_attr="30742" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="rao.surapaneni" data-renderedposition="33_474.421875_113_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=29805ae9db581fc09c9ffb651f96191e">rao.surapaneni</a>, <a title="licubed" __default_attr="89431" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="licubed" data-renderedposition="33_594.28125_65_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=5cee4621db181fc09c9ffb651f9619b7">licubed</a> &amp; <a title="dave.slusher" __default_attr="17468" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="dave.slusher" data-renderedposition="33_675.5_98_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=34225265dbd81fc09c9ffb651f96194b">dave.slusher</a> our idea to bring such MeetUps to our city actually came to play.</p><p><img   alt="C3.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" height="229" src="0af899c2dbd8d344e9737a9e0f9619db.iix" style="float: left; width: 304px; height: 228.724px;" width="304"/></p><p></p><p>We now have these MeetUps all across the country namely, <strong>Bengaluru</strong>, <strong>Hyderabad</strong>, <strong>Chennai</strong>, <strong>Pune</strong> and <strong>New Delhi</strong>. The New Delhi episode was initiated for the first time on <strong>June 24th, 2017</strong> when we decided to take the baton of kindling this light. This started to shine amongst the Developer community folks within the region who were all hiding in plain sight.</p><p></p><p>India has a huge pool of developer resources (let alone talent) that have often been silently working in the dark. It was time to bring them out to light and provide a beacon for the local developer community. The point of it has been to bring out all those souls out from the dark and get them all together for mutual benefits in terms of meaningful technical discussions &amp; networking.</p><p></p><p>After the first successful initiation, we became obligated to make it better on the next. Hence, we had <a title="dave.slusher" __default_attr="17468" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="dave.slusher" data-renderedposition="245_971.796875_98_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=34225265dbd81fc09c9ffb651f96194b">dave.slusher</a> all the way from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to address us on this episode of our Delhi MeetUp. As much as we were excited with our <strong>Special Guest</strong>, we was also concerned on the number of attendees who would make it to this event.</p><p><img   alt="C1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="270" src="84341cc2db541f048c8ef4621f961926.iix" style="float: right; width: 270px; height: 270px;" width="270"/></p><p></p><p>We had a turn-around of 20+ attendees which was a decent number. Although, we hoped for more people to turn up but we are glad that people did fine time out to make it to this event. I guess we'll just have to continue being persistent and try to bring in more of these smart folks, out from the dark.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="5.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" height="134" src="cf583779dbd0d3049c9ffb651f96192a.iix" style="float: left; width: 178px; height: 133.787px;" width="178"/>This was a post-lunch event and we've done our best to connect with every individual in that conference hall. Dave had given us some very useful insight on the new features and capabilities with the Jakarta release while later we had some interesting questions on the aspects of integration with ServiceNow and 3rd party applications. There were just about enough questions popping out to fill in everyone's curious minds.</p><p></p><p>The cheat sheet hand-outs sent by Lily Li (<a title="licubed" __default_attr="89431" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="licubed" data-renderedposition="519_475.046875_65_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=5cee4621db181fc09c9ffb651f9619b7">licubed</a>) was indeed quite informative to us all. Special thanks to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="17477" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=1b1e4ee1dbd41fc09c9ffb651f96195f" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">josh.nerius</a> who couldn't make it this time but hopefully next time.</p><p></p><p>A well-deserved shout-out to the boys (<a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="90947" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=5611d625db981fc09c9ffb651f96191e" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">prabhat-awc</a><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">, </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="130203" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=b2e11661dbd81fc09c9ffb651f9619f2" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">hiteshsharma,</a><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="62694" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=01d09221db981fc09c9ffb651f9619c2" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">harshvardhansingh</a><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">, </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="81001" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=b68f46e9db181fc09c9ffb651f96195b" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">er.manojbhati@gmail.com</a><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">, <a title="gyani110" __default_attr="80748" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="gyani110" data-renderedposition="582_728.09375_75_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=182fc625db181fc09c9ffb651f96197a">gyani110</a> &amp; </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="91071" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=78305aa5db581fc09c9ffb651f96192d" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">aalo</a>) who stood by during this event and provided assistance that was much required to make it another success. Again a special thanks to Dave Slusher (<a title="dave.slusher" __default_attr="17468" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="dave.slusher" data-renderedposition="603_910.1875_98_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=34225265dbd81fc09c9ffb651f96194b">dave.slusher</a>) for taking the pain to go <strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong> and extending his trip from Pune to Delhi. I suppose by now he just might have finally made it back home.</p><p></p><p>We would like to close it off with the note to all fellow developers from the ServiceNow community (specially the ones within Delhi NCR) to step up and be a part of this amazing event that we have started it off. Our intent is to bring in positivity to our ServiceNow ecosystem where we promote the culture to share &amp; build something better that would help us grow and evolve.</p>
