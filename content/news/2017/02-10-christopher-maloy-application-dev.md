<p>This best practice only applies if you are working on the Istanbul or later release.   When using the automated test framework, it is a good idea to build your test while you build your form and code.   This best practice really only applies to testing your ServiceNow forms.   Once you feel like you have the mandatory fields and default view identified and your data model pretty solid, you should create a test.   <strong>I recommend doing one test per form (if possible).</strong>   Some people will create a separate test per field and this is not recommended in my book.   It takes a long time to start up and run these test, so I have learned to chain related test together using the steps within the Automated Testing Framework (ATF).</p><p>For example:   Below is the form from a property management application.   This form is specifically used for managing the properties I rent.   You can see there is a mandatory field on <strong>Address</strong>, but there is also an UI policy that controls the visibility of the <strong>Parking under structure</strong> field.   If the type field is switch to Single Family Home the parking under structure field goes away.</p><p>Now that my form is done and I have the behavior I expect, I can create one automated test for this page that will test the behavior of the entire form.
