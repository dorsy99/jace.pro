<p>It starts out innocently enough: a server you manage needs a quick patch update installed, so you figure you'll make the modifications on the fly, and just get it done. A couple clicks of a mouse, and next thing you know, a service running on that server comes to a screeching haltâ€”all because of a pesky little change. Could this have been avoided? Absolutely. That's where change management comes in. Change management gives you the ability to proactively manage risk by enabling beneficial changes to be made with minimal disruption to IT services. Something that would have been helpful prior to your update-on-the-fly fiasco!</p><p></p><p><strong><img   alt="CAB1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="385" src="ee88558adb5c9f048c8ef4621f96198a.iix" style="float: right; height: 385px; width: 480.282px;" width="480"/>ServiceNow makes it easy</strong></p><p>ServiceNow makes the change management process easy by providing the tools and visibility you need to automate and administer the change and release lifecycle.
