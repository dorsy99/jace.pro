Personally, it will be a first for me as well and a worthwhile trip.   In the midst of today's digital world, it provides the unique opportunity to put that human interaction back into exchanging information and ideas.</p><p></p><p>Knowledge17 kicks off with the Go-Live reception on Monday, May 8th. First evening events never disappoint, as everyone is fresh and it is a great time to start those conversations amongst peers. Your first top thing to do!   Make sure to get there ready to go at 5:30 p.m. when it begins.</p><p></p><p>What is the second top thing to do? Attend the opening keynote speech.   The keynote speech helps to set the tone of the event and the expectations of the days that follow.   It triggers key topics to jump start any conversation with your neighbor and can open new topics that possibly would have never come to mind.</p><p></p><p>Top thing number three is visit the Expo Hall. One of the biggest opportunities is getting to learn more about the offerings that can build upon your implementation and empower you with new insights and opportunities around your ServiceNow installation.   Be sure to stop by the BDNA booth, where you can learn how BDNA supports IT ops and business management applications across the NOW platform and beyond. Find out why so many ServiceNow customers have implemented BDNA to accelerate their implementation, enable lifecycle management of hardware and software, leverage efficiencies for better service management, governance and compliance, while triggering vigilance around security, vendor management, and procurement. BDNA simplifies communication across all of your business processes with a common language.   Curious how?   Be sure to come by to visit BDNA at booth #235.</p><p></p><p>The fourth thing on my list is to ensure you attend key sessions where ServiceNow customers share their experiences. Nothing is better than hearing the stories from your peers about their implementation of ServiceNow. One particular session not to miss is Tuesday, May 9th at 5 pm. on Level 3, room W311 CD.   The session is entitled, <em><a title="nowledge.servicenowevents.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=Winning+with+confidence+in+your+data&searchType=session&tc=0&sortBy=&p=http://" href="https://knowledge.servicenowevents.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=Winning+with+confidence+in+your+data&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;p=http://">Winning with Confidence in Your Data — Lessons Learned While Eliminating the Dirty Work</a></em>.</p><p></p><p>Finally, while in the Expo Hall, don't forget to attend the Theatre Now presentations, your fifth thing to do.   More insights and tools are sure to be shared from various customers and partners. Be sure to grab a seat while enjoying your lunch or evening cocktail!</p><p></p><p>See you at Knowledge17!</p>
