<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The HR Customer Success team hosted 9 individuals from 5 organizations for an intimate lunch event in Atlanta on April 20, 2017.   Customers were provided an opportunity to network with other HR professionals in their area, hear from the HR BU on its strategy and product roadmap, see a demo of Istanbul as well as get a sneak peak into Jakarta. Participation in the HR Community, as well as Knowledge17 and local SNUGs, was also highlighted and encouraged.</span></p><p></p><p><img  alt="Atlanta.jpeg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="1159ef7ddb181fc03eb27a9e0f961961.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 465px;"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Feedback from the group was that the afternoon was one of the more valuable meetings that they had participated in.   They appreciated the ability to dive into HR-specific topics, gather best practices from other customers using HRSM, and see what's coming in future HRSM deliverables. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto;">If you are interested in participating in one of the upcoming HR Community day <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=356dea29dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961960">events</a>, please email me directly at <a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:julie.gardiner@servicenow.com"><span style="color: blue;">julie.gardiner@servicenow.com</span></a>.
