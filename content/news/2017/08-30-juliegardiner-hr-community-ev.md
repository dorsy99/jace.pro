Having the HR Customer Success team there demonstrated our commitment to them and their ongoing success as customers of HR.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">Are you in attending or hosting an HR Community event?
