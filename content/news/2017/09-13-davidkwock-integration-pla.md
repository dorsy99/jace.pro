<p>Last week at CreatorCon San Diego myself and a few colleagues from the Inspire Program had the pleasure of presenting during the Enterprise Architecture Track a few of the presentations from Knowledge.   We focused on the topics that we felt most applied to the Enterprise Architecture Community.   This included Integration Platform as a Service, Rationalizing your technology landscape and Application Inheritance to provide flexibility and scale to your environment.</p><p></p><p>Below are the links to the original presentations from knowledge:</p><p>     </p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=90dc2665dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96197c">https://community.servicenow.com/docs/DOC-7051</a></p><p></p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=a44daee5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961978">https://community.servicenow.com/docs/DOC-7038</a></p><p></p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;"><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=023c2a61dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96196e">https://community.servicenow.com/docs/DOC-6816</a></p><p></p><p>During the Integration as a Platform presentation we shared the definition and key components of integration platform as a service (iPaaS) along with an example of leveraging the ServiceNow platform as a iPaaS layer.   Below are the key components of a iPaaS solution as defined by the industry.</p><p><img  alt="blog1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="ecccddcadb9c97049c9ffb651f9619ef.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 201px;"/></p><p>Our definition included why ServiceNow was uniquely positioned as a iPaaS layer and also some of the flexibility that the platform provided when leveraging it as a iPaaS solution.   Below are the key components of an iPaaS solution on top of the capabilities of the ServiceNow Platform.</p><p><img  alt="blog2.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="5398f00adbd89344e9737a9e0f96194f.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 253px;"/></p><p>Finally, we concluded with a real world example of applying iPaaS on ServiceNow for a real world customer solution.   In our example we solve for the managers and requestors that have a daily battery of requests and use multiple tools on their desktop to manage this type of work.   They are frustrated by the lack of standardization for each request they get from their employees.   The amount of time lost everyday in doing these types of tasks take a toll on other more important, impactful work and management knows it.   To solve the problem we leverage ServiceNow as a iPaaS to consolidate the different types of request into a single, mobile first application where requests provide context and accountability for approvals with the ability to delegate if necessary in a easy to use way.   Creating this type of solution allows for management and requestors alike to focus on impactful projects while giving them back precious hours they would have lost tracking approvals across a multitude of systems.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="blog3.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="2eb7d8cadbd817049c9ffb651f961997.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 611px;"/></p><p></p><p>After the demonstration at CreatorCon of this example there was a lot of questions about if this example was reusable and if folks could experience this in a live environment.   The quick answer was "Yes" and it lead into a discussion about <a title="experiences.com/" href="http://snexperiences.com/">snexperiences.com.</a></p><p></p><p>In snexperiences when you launch the universal approval experience you can even go to the design library to see how it was built.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="blog4.png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="1957f3f1db5cdf04e9737a9e0f96191d.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 768px;"/></p><p></p><p>Attached to the blog post is the final deck from CreatorCon San Diego.   Let me know if you have success or failure as you take the Journey with ServiceNow and iPaaS.</p><p></p>
