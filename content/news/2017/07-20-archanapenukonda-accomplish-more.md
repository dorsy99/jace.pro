This and a host of other capabilities and enhancements are coming to you in Jakarta to enable you to achieve <strong>higher service levels faster</strong>.

Customers get unprecedented visibility into how their key performance indicators for ITSM compare with their industry averages.   Customers also have the option to look at benchmarks relative to similar size organizations.

The SLA timelines gives you an intuitive interface to see all of the tasks related to and SLA. With the SLA timeline it is much easier for service desk leads and SLA managers to evaluate <span lang="MR" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">—</span> at a glance - how SLAs are behaving under different situations, and why. This information can be used to easily diagnose the events that impacted SLAs, help improve processes, and deliver service at higher levels.</p><p></p><p><em>Price: No additional cost. </em></p><p></p><pre __default_attr="info" __jive_macro_name="alert" alert="info" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_alert" data-renderedposition="2941_8_1139_46"><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: gray; font-size: 12pt;"><em>SLA Timeline helps you proactively identify tasks at risk of breaching SLA</em></span></p></pre><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img   class="image-3 jive-image" height="371" src="5e66f739db1cdf04e9737a9e0f9619ff.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 995px; height: 371.467px;" width="995"/></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Survey and Assessment</strong></p><p>Have you been using the Survey and Assessments application in ServiceNow?   If not, it's time to dust off these applications and take a look.   You should not have to pay for separate applications to run surveys and assessments for your service desk.   These capabilities are built into the ServiceNow platform so you can take advantage of the single system of record and drive services from that single command center in your ServiceNow portal.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New in Jakarta</span></p><p></p><p>Smiley faces and emojis make surveys more intuitive and engaging.   Your customer in the enterprise already does this in his/her personal life when he/she takes surveys on a mobile device.   There is no reason to make enterprise surveys unnecessarily tedious. Also, there is an assessment widget in the Service Portal so agents as well as users do not have to switch applications to get to assessments. ServiceNow Surveys and Assessments help you drive greater customer satisfaction through Continual Service Improvement.</p><p></p><p><em>Price: No additional cost. </em></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="color: gray;"><em style="color: gray;"><em>       </em></em></span></p><pre __default_attr="info" __jive_macro_name="alert" alert="info" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_alert" data-renderedposition="3788_8_1139_43"><em style="color: gray;"><em> Easy, mobile-friendly interface make surveys and assessments more intuitive for users</em></em></pre><p></p><p><img   class="jive-image image-4" height="367" src="542e99c2dbdc97049c9ffb651f9619b3.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; height: 367px; width: 630.09px;" width="630"/></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Service Catalog</strong></p><p>If you are a ServiceNow customer, you very likely use the ServiceNow Service Catalog.   A fundamental building block of IT services, the Catalog is an integral part of all deployments and upgrades.   However, building and executing test cases required manual effort and could be tedious.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New in Jakarta </span></p><p></p><p>The Jakarta release puts more power in the hands of the administrators by automating the testing of requester and fulfiller workflows. The Automated Testing Framework or ATF allows administrators to automate and reuse test cases. Test cases can be bundled together into Test suites to automate testing of end-to-end use cases. The ATF plus new health check tools make building, maintaining, and upgrading your service catalog easier than ever.</p><p></p><p><em>Price: No additional cost. </em></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p><pre __default_attr="info" __jive_macro_name="alert" alert="info" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_alert" data-renderedposition="4607_8_1139_43"><span style="color: gray;"><em>Automated Testing Framework makes upgrades and troubleshooting easier</em></span></pre><p></p><p></p><p><img   class="image-5 jive-image" height="434" src="84893c42db109f048c8ef4621f9619ce.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 965px; height: 434.25px;" width="965"/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope that provides you a good overview of the highlights in the Jakarta Release for ITSM.
