<p>So, this time I my journey took me into the Service Portal and the widgets. This time I was looking at a knowledge article within the portal and wonder who I can make the picture bigger if I clicked on it. To be able to achieve that I took use of the functionality called <strong>Link function</strong> which you can see in the widget editor. I can easily say that I never used that before so I wasn't really sure how to use it and what it really was for.</p><p>I took a look at the documentation and what I could find out was that I used <strong>Link Function</strong> to directly manipulate the DOM (<a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/widget-dev-guide.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/widget-dev-guide.html">Link Docs</a>). And this was pretty much what I was after. To manipulate the pictures in the articles so if I click on them, I would get a enlarged version.</p><p></p><p>I made a video here showing what I did and how I did it.</p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/2Se_wR0XIbU" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p>So grab a cup of coffee and enjoy.</p><p>//GÃ¶ran</p><p></p><p><img  alt="Symfoni Logo Color Box.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" height="56" src="f810ebfddb1093041dcaf3231f9619af.iix" style="width: 193px; height: 56.3435px;" width="193"/><img  alt="sn-community-mvp.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="8b118046db585fc03eb27a9e0f9619d2.iix" style="width: auto; height: auto;"/></p>
