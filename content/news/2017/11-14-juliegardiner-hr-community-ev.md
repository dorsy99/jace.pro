<p> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">On Thursday, November 9, ServiceNow hosted an HR Community event in Denver that included a "user-group" session for HRSD customers only, followed by a dinner for prospects and customers. </span></p><p></p><p><img  alt="IMG_6891.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="239" src="5a993ccedbd097041dcaf3231f961979.iix" style="width: 318px; height: 238.5px;" width="318"/> <img  alt="IMG_6895.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" height="236" src="103a3bb5db945704ed6af3231f961949.iix" style="width: 315px; height: 236.25px;" width="315"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Customers were provided an opportunity to network with other HR professionals in their area, share best practices, hear from the HR BU on its strategy and product roadmap and get a sneak peak of Kingston. Feedback from the group was that the session was valuable and a great way to deep dive into what other customers were doing. Â  They appreciated the ability to discuss HR-specific topics, gather best practices from other customers using HRSD, and engage in an innovative community in the HR space. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Participation in the HR Community, as well as local SNUG and Knowledge18 was also highlighted and encouraged.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Are you in attending or hosting an HR Community event?
