<p>Ensuring good developments practices are being followed, is a challenge on ServiceNow space since the application much native support or adds any constraints in the system, that can stop/alert the developers from following bad practices. This becomes even more challenging if multiple vendors are involved in instance maintenance or development or if the team has members of varying experiences.</p><p></p><p>Over time, this results in increased maintenance cost of the system and inflated upgrade costs and efforts.</p><p></p><p>I have been working on this idea as a pet project from last few months and wanted to share the current update about it. This application/framework is an attempt to reduce such risks and can be used by developers or implementer of the application to introduce constraints, development standards, naming standards, etc without much of an effort.</p><p></p><p>This application will let you add constraints in the form of scripts, keywords or pattern based objects.</p><p></p><p>You can find the latest update on the below GitHub repo with complete documentation and some test data.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/iamkalai/SNStandardsFramework" title="https://github.com/iamkalai/SNStandardsFramework">GitHub - iamkalai/SNStandardsFramework: This contains a global app that can be used on ServiceNow to create a developmenâ€¦</a> <a href="https://github.com/iamkalai/SNStandardsFramework" title="https://github.com/iamkalai/SNStandardsFramework"><br/></a></p><p></p><p><strong>Note: This application is meant to be only used for development environment. </strong></p><p><strong>This is not an application for doing any best practices scans on Instance (like ACE report or similar products)</strong></p><h1 style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding-bottom: 0.3em; font-size: 2em; border-bottom: 1px solid #eaecef; color: #24292e; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol';"></h1><p></p><h1 style="font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 16px; padding-bottom: 0.3em; border-bottom: 1px solid #eaecef; color: #24292e; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol';"></h1>
