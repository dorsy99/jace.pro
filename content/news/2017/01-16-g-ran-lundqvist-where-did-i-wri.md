<p><strong>EDIT: *The UI Page "CodeSearchExampleUse" mention below doesn't work in Istanbul release, there you need atm. go through the studio*</strong></p><p></p><p>I have been supposed to write this post for months now, and finally I got the time to do it.</p><p></p><p>I doubt I'm the only one being in the position where I forgot where I wrote a specific piece of code or that you can see that something is changing the data, but you can't figure out how/where.</p><p></p><p>Lucky for us, ServiceNow has a solution for us, you just need to search a bit to find it. The solution is named "Code Search". This been around for a while and it pretty much lets you easy search for a piece of code in a lot of places. After read what I could find in the docs, I would guess this is made primary for the ServiceNow Studio and I'll come back to that in the end of this post.</p><p></p><p>so, here is how to find it:</p><p></p><p>Code Search itself is an application and you can find it by going to "System Applications-&gt;Applications" in the navigator.</p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" height="120" src="f65eefbddbd49b048c8ef4621f961902.iix" style="width: 166px; height: 119.858px;" width="166"/></p><p></p><p>Then you need to click on "downloads" and there it appears in the list. You can click on it to get some more information about it.</p><p><img   class="image-2 jive-image" height="196" src="3195d1cadb18130468c1fb651f9619a8.iix" style="width: 599px; height: 196.124px;" width="599"/></p><p></p><p>Looking around in the records it has, you can see that it got a UI page called "CodeSearchExampleUse", let's look at it.</p><p><img   class="image-3 jive-image" src="26cea802db58dfc068c1fb651f961982.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>You can see its got a endpoint, so lets click on it and see how it looks like.</p><p><img   class="image-5 jive-image" height="170" src="f8a2fbbddb9c93041dcaf3231f961901.iix" style="width: 444px; height: 169.723px;" width="444"/></p><p></p><p>Just check the box "Search All Applications" and fill in what you looking for and tada, it gives you the result.</p><p><img   class="jive-image image-4" src="23615842dbd01f048c8ef4621f96194e.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p>Here you can see that for example there is 2 client scripts having "setValue" within them. It also give us the client script name and even at which row it can be found.</p><p></p><p>Atm. I can see that it searches through:</p><ul><li>Approval Steps</li><li>Inbound Email Actions</li><li>Style</li><li>Installation Exists</li><li>Client Script</li><li>Validation Script</li><li>Scheduled Script Execution</li><li>Relationship</li><li>Macro</li><li>UI Page</li><li>AJAX Script</li><li>Transform Script</li><li>Notification</li><li>MID Server Script Include</li><li>Access Control</li><li>Map Page</li><li>Workflow Activity Definition</li><li>Knowledge Nav-ons</li><li>Schedule Item</li><li>Table Transform Map</li><li>UI Script</li><li>Business Rule</li><li>Dynamic Content</li><li>Email Template</li><li>BSM Map Actions</li><li>Processor</li><li>Script Include</li><li>UI Action</li><li>UI Policy</li><li>Widget</li><li>Script Action</li></ul><p></p><p>So it's quite the list and a real nice help to find stuff.</p><p></p><p>But it's some clicks to get to the search page and sadly there isn't an application with modules done for this. But you can make your own.</p><p></p><p>This is what I have done:</p><p><img   class="image-6 jive-image" height="170" src="c504110edbd89f048c8ef4621f9619b1.iix" style="width: 629px; height: 170.439px;" width="629"/></p><p>I've made my own application with modules that I use often and I put CodeSearch as one module. The module looks like this:</p><p><img   class="image-7 jive-image" height="365" src="f0eb240edb18d704ed6af3231f9619e0.iix" style="width: 468px; height: 365.342px;" width="468"/></p><p></p><p>And just to show you what I meant with it exists in studio, this is where you will find it:</p><p></p><p><img   class="jive-image image-8" height="99" src="713d4c0edbd09704ed6af3231f96199f.iix" style="width: 604px; height: 99.3677px;" width="604"/></p><p></p><p>So there you go. I hope this will help you in the search of code as it has done for me.</p><p></p><p>Take care,</p><p>Göran</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Symfoni Logo Color Box.jpg" class="image-9 jive-image" height="56" src="8ed66f71db181704ed6af3231f9619ae.iix" style="width: 195px; height: 56.4474px;" width="195"/><img   alt="advocate.jpg" class="image-10 jive-image" src="e8871d82db5c9f048c8ef4621f9619a6.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p>
