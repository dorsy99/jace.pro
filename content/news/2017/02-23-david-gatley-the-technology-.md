<p>As new partners orient within the Technology Partner Program, or consider joining the program, I&#39;m often put in a place where I&#39;m answering many of the same questions. I&#39;ll be updating this blog post as more frequently asked questions emerge, for now, take a look at the following to see if any of the questions you may have are answered.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Q: Are there resources/guidelines available for developing a store app?</strong>
<ul><li>A: https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/lp/technology_partner_program?v&#61;kingston</li><li>A: https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/lp/technology_partner_program_quick_start?v&#61;kingston</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Q: What is the high level process of getting it reviewed for publication?</strong>
<ul><li>A:   <a class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" title="Guide to getting your App Certified &amp; Certification Requirements" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;259dea69dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961969" rel="nofollow">Guide to getting your App Certified &amp; Certification Requirements</a></li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Q: Do store apps need to be developed on specific instances?</strong>
<ul><li>A: Yes, vendor instances acquired from the Technology Partner Program?</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Q: Can we develop an app on our current (non-vendor) instance and then have it published?</strong>
<ul><li>A: This is not recommended. Creating an application within a vendor instance (venXXXXX.service-now.com) is the best way to ensure no downstream issues arise.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Q: As a Technology Partner, what governance do we need in place to ensure certification?</strong>
<ul><li>A: <a class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" title="Guide to getting your App Certified &amp; Certification Requirements" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;259dea69dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961969" rel="nofollow">Guide to getting your App Certified &amp; Certification Requirements</a></li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Q: Is there any ongoing certification/support we need in place?</strong>
<ul><li>A: Yes. We require you stay current (n-3) with our releases. Here is a guide on recertification:   <a class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" title="How To: Recertify your certified application for new ServiceNow releases" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;2aedaee9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619f4" rel="nofollow">How To: Recertify your certified application for new ServiceNow releases</a></li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Q: Are there any limitations to the apps we can develop? (i.e. building out our own Incident Management or ITSM application which may overlap with the core ServiceNow functionality)</strong>
<ul><li>A: While we don&#39;t advise partners to compete, we won&#39;t block it. That being said, we see more success with our partners and customers when the partner products are focused on the whitespace around the existing ServiceNow platform. The Technology Partner program can be used to help identify this white space and provide the necessary orientation and training around these areas.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Q: How can I test the customer download experience from the store?</strong>
