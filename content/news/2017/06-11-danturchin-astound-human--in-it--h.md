He and hordes of Kurzweilians call their philosophy "the singularity" (a term first coined by <a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" rel="nofollow noopener" style="font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #8c68cb; background-position: initial;" target="_blank">John von Neumann</a> in the 1950s), teach it in <a title="u.org/" href="https://su.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" style="font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #8c68cb; background-position: initial;" target="_blank">faux-universities</a>, and <a title="witter.com/singularityhub?lang=en" href="https://twitter.com/singularityhub?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener" style="font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #8c68cb; background-position: initial;" target="_blank">tweet</a> about it (incessantly).</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">Elon Musk is popularizing Kurzweil's ideas with his newly-announced startup <a title="euralink.com/" href="https://neuralink.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" style="font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #8c68cb; background-position: initial;" target="_blank">Neuralink</a> which aims to merge the human brain with artificial intelligence.

Perhaps that's the essence of humanity: manipulating tools to serve our primal needs. Nobody accused cavepeople of being half human-half stick when they invented fire. Nobody accused Orville and Wilbur of being half propeller when they flew Kitty Hawk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">Throughout history, we've demonstrated our ingenuity as a species by conquering technological barriers. Today, those barriers are forcing us to ask existential, philosophical questions but they're no different from when we conquered famine by farming or disease by mold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">What's happening in our tidy world of IT is a microcosm of what's happening everywhere else: we're confronting what it means to simultaneously control and be controlled by technology. Apocalypts among us claim automation is bad. They say machines making decisions is a threat. Algorithms will displace jobs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">That may happen but for those on the right side of progress machines will create far more jobs than they eliminate. For instance:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">We'll need humans to explain the decisions made by algorithms.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">We'll need humans to train and tune applications as new types of questions and problems emerge.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">We'll need humans to train humans to use machines.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">Having access to technology is the very essence of a first-world problem: one we should embrace, study, and solve. From now on, we live in a world where what can be predicted is better left to machines… but what requires judgment is better left to humans. In IT, those cultivating human skills like empathy and leadership will be leaders and innovators in the decades ahead.</span><span style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);">I thought about this recently when a friend's son graduating college with a degree in Forestry asked for advice about how to start a career in IT. My first thought was that I regretted not taking Forestry in college. My second was I'm not sure what a degree in Forestry is but I love the idea of communing in nature with an axe for course credit. My third emerged as three suggestions…</span></span></p><ol style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><li><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">Find a CIO mentor you believe in who believes in you. Don't ask about his or her past. Ask about their future and how you can be part of it.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">Walk the plank… with a snorkel… every day. Living in chaos is the essence of a career in IT. Get comfortable being uncomfortable.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">Don't study today's networks or n-tier architectures or protocols. Study customer service. What's required to delight customers is timeless.</span></li></ol><p style="margin-top: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 3.2rem; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; font-size: 21px; background-position: initial; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961);"><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino; font-size: 14pt;">As a species, we'll keep learning. We'll keep failing. We'll keep integrating technology more seamlessly into our lives until "we + machines" becomes "we" and our greatest asset becomes how we augment brains with bits. When that happens, we'll call it progress. And making progress is what makes us human.</span></p>
