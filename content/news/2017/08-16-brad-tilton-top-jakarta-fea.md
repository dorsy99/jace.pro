<p>Something that I've done since my first ServiceNow upgrade experience as a customer admin/developer is read through all of the release notes. That particular release (The <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Winter_2009_Release_Notes" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Winter_2009_Release_Notes">Winter 2009 Release</a>) included features we now take for granted like Graphical Workflow and tabbed forms, but they were a big deal at the time! I've continued this practice of reading through the release notes, even though it takes me longer as we release more features and enhancements with every release. After reading through the latest release notes from the Jakarta release, I think there are a number of new features that store developers will want to be aware of, as well as some tools that may be helpful in developing your applications.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>New Features</strong></span></p><p></p><p><strong><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/help-guided-tours/concept/guided-tours.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/help-guided-tours/concept/guided-tours.html">Guided Tours</a></strong></p><p>If you take nothing else from this blog post, I hope you at least take a look at guided tours and consider how you might use it in your application. A guided tour provides a way to demonstrate to users how to use a feature. An administrator can create a task demo with callouts to demonstrate how to do something in the instance, such as how to perform a task. This is an easy way to train users of your application from within the application itself.</p><p><em>Resources</em>:</p><p><a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWx3HThkhPM" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWx3HThkhPM">Guided Tours YouTube Demo</a> from <a title="michaelslabodnick" __default_attr="35847" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="michaelslabodnick" data-renderedposition="265_226.625_135_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=0f91562ddb981fc09c9ffb651f9619ac">michaelslabodnick</a></p><p><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9bbd6ea9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961957">Getting Started with the Guided Tour Designer Blog Post</a> from <a title="josh.nerius" __default_attr="17477" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="josh.nerius" data-renderedposition="286_398.21875_87_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=1b1e4ee1dbd41fc09c9ffb651f96195f">josh.nerius</a></p><p><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=3fbdaea9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96192b">Embedded Help and Guided Tours in Jakarta</a> from <a title="jaimehonaker" __default_attr="116286" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive-link-profile-small jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-id="116286" data-objecttype="3" data-orig-content="jaimehonaker" data-type="person" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=9e6e0e29dbd41fc09c9ffb651f9619e4">jaimehonaker</a></p><p></p><p><strong><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/auto-test-framework/concept/atf-overview.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/auto-test-framework/concept/atf-overview.html">Automated Testing Framework</a></strong></p><p>I know what you're thinking, <em>Brad you included this in your Istanbul blog and it's been out for a while,</em> and you're not wrong. However, the ATF received some enhancements in Jakarta so if you had previously dismissed it for some reason, it may be worth taking a second look. In Jakarta the ATF now supports testing REST messages, Service Catalog requests, and scheduling tests. As a technology partner, I would look into creating and bundling tests with your application so your customers can test your application in their environment against things like new releases or other major instance changes.</p><p>Resources:</p><p><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=203d2ae5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619ed">Jakarta Juices Up Automated Test Framework (ATF)</a> from <a title="janiceg" __default_attr="67565" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="janiceg" data-renderedposition="475_368.1875_64_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=0e309ea5db581fc09c9ffb651f961950">janiceg</a></p><p></p><p><strong><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/metricbase/concept/metricbase.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/metricbase/concept/metricbase.html">MetricBase</a></strong></p><p>Use the MetricBase product to collect, retain, analyze, and visualize time series data on the Now Platform.

User roles are automatically migrated to user criteria upon upgrade.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/data-table-url-widget.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/data-table-url-widget.html">Condition builder</a> - Use the platform UI condition builder in the Data table from URL definition widget to create more complex table searches. The condition builder is disabled by default, administrators can enable it using the widget instance options for the Data table from URL definition widget.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/c_PageEditor.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/c_PageEditor.html">Portal Page Draft Option</a> - Select the Draft check box in a portal page so that pages remain unpublished in the portal.

Catalog UI Policies, Catalog Client Scripts, Catalog Data Lookups, Reference Qualifiers, and dependent reference fields are supported on the default variable editor used for records created via record producers. This support is applicable only for records created for task-extended tables via record producers.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Platform Enhancements</strong></p><ul><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/api-changes-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/api-changes-rn.html">Scoped Applications APIs</a> - New classes and methods have been added, such as CatItem.availableForUserCriteria() and GlideAggregate.addTrend() among others.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/import-export-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/import-export-rn.html">Import/Export JSON Files</a> - You can import JSON files, or export them using export sets or from a list.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/field-administration/reference/name-value-pair-scripting.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/field-administration/reference/name-value-pair-scripting.html">Name-Value Pair Field Type</a> - This is a field that maps text values. Each mapping is one-to-one, however a single Name-Value Pairs field can contain multiple mappings. Each mapping must use a unique name, and the name cannot be empty. For example, you can use a Name-Value Pairs field to hold header information for a web service request. In this example, the name of each mapping is the header such as Content-Type and the value is the header value, such as Application/json.</li></ul><p></p><p>Is there something missing from this list, or have you found a good blog post or demo video explaining it you'd like me to include in this post?
