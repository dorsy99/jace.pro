Service Portal and Angular, Automated Testing Framework, etc.<br/> <br/>Also, I love to see what exciting stuff may be coming down the pipeline. I remember previewing features before (such as Speech-to-Text-to-Ticket using VoIP integration) that can really make you start looking ahead.   And interesting focus groups are a definite possibility, getting to see some neat stuff that not everyone gets to hear about yet.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>5.   What is one of the most pressing questions/issues you see in service management today?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #3334ca;">Selling the vision for a singular system of engagement.   I can feel the potential and possibilities because really, I don't see anything that can't be done using the platform.   The freedom to create, manipulate, and extend leads me to believe that the limitations you run into will most likely be external to the platform and often, human-derived.   Convincing the upper echelons to put both feet in the boat is where I find the greatest challenge.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>6.   What one thing do you want to learn at Knowledge17?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #3334ca;">I would like to attain a level of mastery with AngularJS and the Service Portal application.   I am fairly satisfied with my logic and data skills, so UX is where I've committed to pushing myself right now.   I've been doing the self-training bit with Service Portal, and it simply blows the doors off of CMS/Jelly.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>7.   If you could choose a band to perform at Knowledge who would it be?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Wow… this may be dating myself a bit, but I never got to see my favorite band live.   And to see them now would take more conflict-resolution than a platform upgrade, but I'd nominate Van Halen (with Sammy or DLR, take your pick… just not that other guy)</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/SwYN7mTi6HM" width="440" height="330"/></span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>MVP <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=1d629669dbd81fc09c9ffb651f961916">Michael Fry's</a> Perspective:</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1.   How many Knowledge events have you attended?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #3334ca; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This will be my 7<sup>th</sup> year for attending.   New Orleans 2012 was my first one.</span><br/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2.   What has been your favorite thing about attending Knowledge in the past?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The pre-conference training is excellent. It's not too fast paced, and always plenty of teacher helpers around to help answer questions. The labs are also fantastic.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3.   Why would you encourage others to attend Knowledge?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The training is invaluable, and the partners are great. If you spend time talking to the partners, meeting and greeting other developers, Servicenow employees, you can find solutions to open items you might have in your instance. You might find a better way to do something.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>4.   What are you most excited about for Knowledge17?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">My company is expanding exponentially and we have initiates under way for HR, and Performance Analytics, with future plans for Finance, and probably ServiceWatch soon as well as several integrations. While I've touched most of these apps, I could use some extra knowledge so I can make sure things get setup correctly the first time.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>5.   What is one of the most pressing questions/issues you see in service management today?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The platform makes it easy for other departments/groups to get connected, integrated, and/or onboard. The problem occurs when several departments want to integrate their app with Servicenow. You might have a plugin or vendor specific download, but is that the right want? Or should we get something like Event Management that works with several 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps and be farther away in the future. I have 3-4 integrations pending until planning is done.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>6.   What one thing do you want to learn at Knowledge17?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #3334ca;">Performance Analytics</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>7.   If you could choose a band to perform at Knowledge who would it be?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Flo Rida</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/JQCA6e1E3BA" width="440" height="330"/></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>MVP <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=eb4f86e5db181fc09c9ffb651f961907">Goran Lundqvist</a> Perspective:</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1.   How many Knowledge events have you attended?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #3334ca; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Knowledge 17 will be my third knowledge I'm attending</span><br/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2.   What has been your favorite thing about attending Knowledge in the past?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">All the knowledge that is gathered in one place. It really gives you the perfect opportunity to learn more about what you really want to. And you can decide if you want to listen to others how they did it, or more hands on with labs.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>3.   Why would you encourage others to attend Knowledge?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">For me, this was the gold mine where I really started to understand the power of ServiceNow and how to do it. Don't forget the pre-courses which gives you a pre-start of the conference.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>4.   What are you most excited about for Knowledge17?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To meet all the people from the community and get a real face on all those nicknames.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>5.   What is one of the most pressing questions/issues you see in service management today?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">How to take the next step, many companies have been going pretty good in the ITSM sphere. Now many of them are wondering how to get to the next level. It might be taken the step outside of IT, or how to really get automation in IT and leverage the real power of ServiceNow.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>6.   What one thing do you want to learn at Knowledge17?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">A crash course in regex would be something I really would need. But I hope to dig deeper into Service Portal and the magic there.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>7.   If you could choose a band to perform at Knowledge who would it be?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This is real hard.   I would love to see Skrillex perform</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/YJVmu6yttiw" width="440" height="330"/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>MVP <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=d16f4e29db181fc09c9ffb651f9619b5">Berny Alvarado</a>   Perspective</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1.   How many Knowledge events have you attended?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #3334ca; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">K17 will be my third Knowledge conference.

Once you attend the conference you'll learn everything that ServiceNow represents as a <strong>platform, </strong>as a <strong>company</strong> and even as a <strong>family. </strong>I have found that people are amazed and greatly embrace ServiceNow after attending a Knowledge conference.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>4.   What are you most excited about for Knowledge17?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">People.   Looking forward to share and learn from such a diverse and rich group of people that attend the conference every year.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>5.   What is one of the most pressing questions/issues you see in service management today?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Inability to embrace an <strong>Agile / Continuos Improvement</strong> mindset.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>6.   What one thing do you want to learn at Knowledge17?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #3334ca; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What's coming next!!
