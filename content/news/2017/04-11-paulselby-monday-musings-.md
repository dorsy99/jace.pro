<p>I have always found one of the most helpful and satisfying methods to generate new ideas on how to address challenges is to interact directly with others on the topic. To that end, this week I'm going to take the opportunity in this forum to share more about ServiceNow's upcoming premier customer event: <a title="nowledge.servicenow.com/" href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/">Knowledge17</a>.</p><p><img  class="image-2 jive-image" height="63" src="f211a335db901fc068c1fb651f9619dd.iix" style="width: 279px; height: 63px;" width="279"/></p><p>The Knowledge conference is unique in that most of the content for sessions is submitted and presented by customers themselves; while there is the opportunity to learn more about ServiceNow's products and services, more of the content is focused on real-world customer scenarios and stories. </p><p></p><p>Is this a commercial for the event? Yes, it is. But I believe very strongly in events like this where you are able to interact with peers in various forums to share ideas, challenges, and wins. With the conference now less than thirty days away, if you haven't already signed up, it's time to consider attending. I want to give you a few areas in which you might reap the most benefit from learning from fellow customer service practitioners. I'll start with some statistics specific to the customer service-oriented parts of the show:</p><p><img  class="image-1 jive-image" src="f0904cc6db58d3049c9ffb651f961955.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p>As you can see, there's a lot going on during that week in the customer service arena! Allow me to focus specifically on areas where you can get the most from hearing stories from fellow customers and making a personal connection with peers.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Sessions</span></h1><p>As I mentioned, the customer-led sessions selected were proposed by customers and the content is their own journey, in their own words. With stories revolving around adoption and use of ServiceNow Customer Service Management and Field Service Management, they also cover what pain points they were encountering as a business and what led them to consider a change, why ServiceNow became the choice, and how they went about implementing. They will also cover where they stand in terms of addressing the challenges they had, with metrics or other information to back up their current status. Finally, they share where their journey will take them in the future, as they adopt additional ServiceNow or partner solutions and capabilities. The sessions are formal, fifty-minute presentations from a single customer, and you have the opportunity to ask questions as well as make a formal connection to the presenter during the rest of the week.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Customer Service SIG</span></h1><p>SIGs or Special Interest Group sessions will also be offered at the conference. There will be several, focused on products and disciplines such as customer service, as well as some with an industry focus. The Knolwedge17 approach to SIGs is to seat everyone at individual tables (with multiple tables in the room). Each table discusses, as a group, the challenges they face as well as to share solutions that have worked. Discussion points will be typical issues facing customer service. This is a great opportunity to connect with colleagues on a smaller scale for more dynamic interactions.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">TableTalks</span></h1><p>Missed the SIG? Or want to continue connecting and discussing relevant topics with your peers? TableTalks occur over lunch, and multiple are scheduled throughout the week on the topic of customer service, field service, and knowledge management. These discussions are on a smaller scale than the SIGs and do require a reservation in advance as space is limited. Need an additional incentive? You receive your lunch sooner so that discussions can begin immediately!</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">See You There!</span></h1><p><span style="color: #303030;">Knowledge17 is a great opportunity to not only learn more about ServiceNow the company and its Customer Service Management portfolio of products but also a great chance to interact with like-minded colleagues in customer service across many different industries and from around the world.
