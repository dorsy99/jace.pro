<p>Wow, a year has already flown by since our last Hackathon at K16. As epic as it was, we have done many events since then all over the world with customers, partners and service providers. Each and every time I am amazed at the breath of solutions that are being produced. We have seen Smart City and IoT apps, philanthropic portals for the distribution of aid during disasters. emergency notification systems, AI using Cortana and workflow, and a real-time sensoring solution for temperature and humidity monitoring, all streaming via a smartphone.</p><p></p><p>This year I expect no less and a similar outcome, only better. The ServiceNow platform continues to grow and more and more capabilities are being added in every release. Istanbul provided some great updates to the platform, to which end we have seen already in the 2017 #HackNow events, some great functionality utilised to solve problems.</p><p></p><p>You can still register using the Session Builder link below, </p><p><a href="https://knowledge.servicenowevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=132267" title="https://knowledge.servicenowevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=132267">CreatorCon Hackathon â€” Build Something Awesome in 8hrs!</a> </p><p></p><p>A fantastic example of what you can do in a few hours can be seen here from a great customer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rJUAl9h7Yk" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rJUAl9h7Yk">Fairfax Media: Learn What You Can Achieve in Just Nine Hours - YouTube</a> </p><p></p><p>A public event in Sydney 2016 drew some massive inspiration from our Partner network and the Telco's: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt_TGLIwPNs" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt_TGLIwPNs">HackNow!
