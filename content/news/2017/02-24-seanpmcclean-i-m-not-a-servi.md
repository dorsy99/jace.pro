<p>The best way to get the hang of ServiceNow Administration is to take the training (<a title="artnerportal.service-now.com/sys_report_display.do?sysparm_report_id=675dd55b6f6906004dd94ad44b3ee411" href="https://partnerportal.service-now.com/sys_report_display.do?sysparm_report_id=675dd55b6f6906004dd94ad44b3ee411">CLICK HERE</a>).   But what if:</p><ul><li>You only manage an Application (or 3) on ServiceNow, like <a title="w.servicenow.com/solutions/hrms.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/solutions/hrms.html">HR Service Management</a>,   <a title="w.servicenow.com/solutions/security-incidents.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/solutions/security-incidents.html">SecOps</a> etc...   instead of Administering the entire platform?</li><li> It's been a while since you've had to do Admin Tasks </li><li> You are lead admin for another platform and only backup on ServiceNow </li><li> Just want to get a quick refresher </li></ul><p>Well, that's the goal of this series.   I'll be doing a few of these, along with fellow trainers (<a title="benforrest" __default_attr="58901" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive-link-profile-small jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-id="58901" data-objecttype="3" data-orig-content="benforrest" data-renderedposition="149.984375_559.421875_83_16" data-type="person" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=fb9e022ddbd41fc09c9ffb651f961975">benforrest</a>, <a title="danny.mortensen" __default_attr="27220" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive-link-profile-small jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-id="27220" data-objecttype="3" data-orig-content="danny.mortensen" data-renderedposition="149.984375_649.984375_127_16" data-type="person" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=fb449a61db5c1fc09c9ffb651f96193b">danny.mortensen</a> and others).   </p><p>Want more?   Well, we're going to be trying to add a deeper version of this - along with step by step video versions within our Learning Library very shortly - and of course, you can always take the class, where our instructors will cover this in much more depth. </p><p>For now, here's a quick take on <em style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>update sets</strong></em> for the "sometimes" Admin: </p><p>An update set is a "package" of functionality that you can pass from one instance of service now to another. </p><p>Importing: Its as easy as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (good thing there's a handy graphic… use it as a "pop sheet if you need).   Some tips: </p><p> - Don't get confused by the "open" button on the file find - it simply selects the xml update set you want to "load" </p><p> - Once you have loaded the update set you haven't (truly) implemented it - you still need to "Review" and "Preview" and "Commit" the update set. </p><p style="text-align: center;"><img  alt="update Sets 1c.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="6a68c84adbd81304b322f4621f9619ae.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 278px;"/></p><p>Review/Preview: </p><p> - Look carefully at the files you are bringing in.   You may not (at first) know everything there, but by looking, you'll gradually get to know the pieces and parts better </p><p> - Always click "preview".   Without this, you won't be able to "commit" </p><p style="text-align: center;"><img  alt="update Sets 2c.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="e0e32b7ddb9093049c9ffb651f96199b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 540px;"/></p><p>But what if… (Errors) </p><p> - Don't Panic!   errors are actually pretty self explanatory: you can choose for each "line" of the update set what you want to do </p><p style="text-align: center;"><img  alt="update Sets 3c.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="bb98010edb1413043eb27a9e0f961963.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 538px;"/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope this was helpful, particularly for those "sometimes admins" or "functional admins", or for people taking classes like our <a title="ervicenow.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA1PRD0015/common/ledetail/ES-SN-OPS" href="https://servicenow.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA1PRD0015/common/ledetail/ES-SN-OPS">Security Operations</a> class …   Stay tuned for more in this series... </p>
