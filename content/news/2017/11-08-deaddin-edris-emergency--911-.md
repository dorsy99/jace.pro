<p><span style="color: #303030;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><img   alt="emergency-911.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="18fb7c02db509f048c8ef4621f9619ff.iix" style="height: auto; float: right;"/>Recently, the ServiceNow Global Services team and our partners had the pleasure of working with America's leading supplier of 911 call-handling technology. </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">For almost 5 decades, they have been serving the communication needs of public and private sector organizations — including state and local public safety agencies, corporations and the US federal government. The company is backed by its parent, which is a global leader in aerospace, defense and related services</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #303030;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Stuck with a legacy tool for ITSM, this organization needed to deliver, service, track and support their customers' 911 systems — providing complete transparency and near real-time case management. As part of handling more than 500 cases a day, the company needed to manage field services, RMA processes, stocks and on-site spares — including managing third-party vendors. As a supplier of public safety communications systems, the company also had to meet strict local, state and FCC regulatory compliance requirements. </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">To respond to these challenges, they evaluated several vendors, and ultimately chose ServiceNow to replace their legacy ITSM tool.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #303030;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Working with our partners, ServiceNow Global Services drove a comprehensive call center transformation project. During the project, ServiceNow Global Services deployed a comprehensive set of ServiceNow applications — including Customer Service Portal, Case Management, Vendor Management, Contract Management, Service Level Management, Problem Management and Change Management — as well as integrating with other call center systems. </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">The team also seamlessly upgraded the ServiceNow Platform during this rollout, allowing the organization to take full advantage of the latest ServiceNow capabilities.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">After going live, they achieved tremendous value by automating processes, consolidating information, and dramatically increasing ease of use. This included:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">Achieving internal SLAs of handling a minimum of 500 cases day</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">Addressing and closing 5,300 cases without any customer issues</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">Driving down response times to customers' actionable alerts</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">Automatically tracking contract entitlements and time spent per customer</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">FCC compliance reporting for 911 systems uptime and issue resolution</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">Comprehensive asset tracking, including assets installed in customer sites</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">Structured RMA and planned maintenance processes</span></li></ul><p style="margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto; background: white;"></p><p style="margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto; background: white;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #303030;">Learn more about:</span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><a title="ww.servicenow.com/solutions/improve-it-service-delivery.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/improve-it-service-delivery.html">IT Service Management</a></span></li><li><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/customer-service-management.html"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Customer Service Management</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/now-platform.html"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Platform</span></a></li><li><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><a title="ww.servicenow.com/services/overview.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/services/overview.html">ServiceNow Global Services</a></span></li></ul>
