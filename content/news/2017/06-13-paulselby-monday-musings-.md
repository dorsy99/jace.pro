Qlue will join other technologies in ServiceNow's <a title="ww.servicenow.com/now-platform/intelligent-automation-engine.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/now-platform/intelligent-automation-engine.html">Intelligent Automation Engine</a>, a new capability of the ServiceNow platform intended to enhance everyday work through the benefits of machine learning. From a customer service perspective, how might companies expect to benefit from the Intelligent Automation Engine? Several possibilities come to mind.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Customer Disposition</span></h1><p>Some customer service agents are very good at reading a customer's emotional state. This is most clearly indicated in the customer's tone and word choices during a conversation. Setting aside the customer's spoken words, which machine learning has already demonstrated skills in real-time analysis, machine learning is growing in its capabilities in discerning tone. While it might not yet rival a human's prowess, it will get there.</p><p></p><p>More than the tone or word choices in a current conversation, where machine learning can aid a customer service organization is in quickly understanding the customer's underlying history. How long have they been a customer? What problems over time have necessitated contacting customer service? What were the priority of those problems, and how quickly were they resolved? Have there been any escalations recently? Are there current sales opportunities (or a service renewal) at play? Going beyond just the current situation, machine learning makes it possible to analyze these peripheral conditions and many more in-the-moment to ensure the right approach is taken in working with the customer.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Issue Priority</span></h1><p>Similar to customer disposition, machine learning can look at the words used - spoken in a telephone conversation or written in a chat or email - to determine a priority. "Broken," "crashed," and similar words might indicate a complete failure and drive a higher priority, whereas terms like "question" or "unclear" might indicate a usage- or "how do I"-type question that might be assigned a lower priority.</p><p></p><p>Beyond simple word recognition, though, is again the ability of machine learning to quickly go deeper than the surface-level indicators. Does the customer have any service level agreement or premium service contracts in place? How have similar cases from other customers been prioritized? Taking it even further, what is the long-term value of this customer and should this issue receive a higher priority as a result?</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Self-Service</span></h1><p>Self-service automation is a great means of addressing common, repetitive issues and is an excellent method to reduce the burden on customer service agents. Today, setting it up is a manual process: start by identifying an issue that qualifies, then build a workflow to connect the customer with the problem to the ultimate solution. What if the benefits of self-service could be even simpler to realize?</p><p></p><p>Machine learning would make identifying and building those workflows much easier. The system could distinguish the steps playing out as agents solved customers' problems. If the problem and those steps qualified for automation, machine learning could automatically suggest it and build the corresponding self-service workflows.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">The New Possibilities</span></h1><p>Customers' desire for fast, accurate resolutions to problems is a constant challenge for companies. The possibilities with machine learning and its impact on business continue to increase every day. For customer service, one of the primary benefits of machine learning is the faster and more consistent classification of high volumes of information, from problem identification to presenting a solution. What does this mean? Regardless if customers are working live with an agent or using self-service solutions, machine learning will speed connecting customers to solutions - and faster resolutions will drive higher satisfaction. </p>
