<p>There's lots of great material out there to familiarize you with the kinds of things PA measures:   KPIs, Metrics, Measures, etc, etc.   Smarter folks than me can teach you about these things.<br/>But as my customers continue to expose me to their PA deployments, and ask my advice, I'm struck by a common weakness.   So many treat PA like they've treated most reporting:   "give me a bunch of data, grouped different ways, and I'll spend effort looking for important insights".   That's a passive, accidental strategy. </p><p></p><p>Its also how we wind up with PA dashboards that split Incidents by priority over time and age in 4 different visualizations that nobody *REALLY* knows how to react to.   <br/>Come to the dashboard.   Stare at the visualizations.   Go to the coffee machine.   Hope the caffeine rush takes the emptiness away.   Wish for a fire drill, if only the shrieking wail will remind you that you're alive.</p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" src="bfbe37f9db901344e9737a9e0f96196a.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p></p><p>There's a better way my friends.   Stop being sanitized.   Stop being "objective", in the sense that your emotions take a second seat.   Embrace the *humanity* that we suppress in reports.</p><p></p><p><strong>HACK:   BRING YOUR EMOTIONS</strong></p><p>For those of us passionate about our jobs, what typically happens when we socialize with work peers?   Someone, probably after a drink, leans forwards and says "You know what's BS?!"</p><p></p><p>And *THAT* my friends, is the secret to Performance Analytics.   Being judgmental.   Black and white.   Opinionated.   There's a whole world of decisions we've already made about performance. You know what's BS?   Waiting a full day for a response.<br/>You know what's BS?   Spending money on "process improvements" only to have the process take longer.<br/>You know what's BS?   That this object has degraded in the same way each month, for a year, and its still not fixed.<br/>You know what's BS?   That there's work out there supposedly "needs" doing that hasn't been *TOUCHED* in 30 days!</p><p>You know what's BS?   That this thing hits 3 different groups before finding the right home.<br/>You know what's BS?   Being told this system is mission critical, but its backlog of work grows by 1/5 an FTE every week.</p><p></p><p>Want people to   take notice of your PA build?   Think only in terms of bad and good, not "possibly interesting".   Use those freaking threshold and target records.   Draw a line in the sand.   Where?   <strong>IN THE SAND!!</strong>   It doesn't matter if your target is good (yet).   What matters is if you're heading towards it.   1 week of watching progress and you find out if your target is sane or not, then adjust it.</p><p></p><p>Performance Analysis is measuring the movement towards good or bad.   It *requires* emotional investment.   We don't need another gentle undulating cosine wave form.   We don't need another volume over time breakdown.   We want measures that drive reaction/reward:   THAT is bad / THAT is good.</p><p></p><p>Build for humans.   Build for emotional reaction.   Do so, and your PA efforts will be celebrated in the halls of Valhalla.</p>
