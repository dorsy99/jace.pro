<p>We are all so used to automation in our personal lives that we do not stop to think about it.   We don't worry about the rigorous fulfillment process that went into having that box from Amazon sitting right at our door with the exact item and quantity we ordered.   A single tap on the Uber app and we know the driver will show up wherever we are. We expect automation in our personal lives like it is our birth right. I know I do.</p><p></p><p><img alt="Automation.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="http://autonoware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Automation.png" style="width: 620px; height: 282px; float: right;"/></p><p>Most of us expect as much automation in our personal lives as much as we expect lack of it at work. We don't like going to the office of our Internet Service Provider to report an outage,yet,we will set out to track down the tech support guy at work to help fix the login issue.   We expect Amazon to send us status updates on our shipment, but we don't quite expect that from our own procurement teams, so we will keep pinging the fulfillment team to track the status of the new phone we ordered through the corporate plan.</p><p></p><p>But it shouldn't have to be that way. Automation drives a lot more than customer satisfaction. Service Management in any form is not be possible without improvements in automation. Automation speeds up processes, removing human dependencies and errors, lowering costs and delivering a more predictable and delightful service experience.   Automation also makes it easy to adapt to changing business needs.   It allows organizations to free up budget and workforce so they can focus on innovation and bottom line rather than worry about keeping the lights on.</p><p></p><p><a title="w.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/case-studies/cs-grupo-bimbo.pdf" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/case-studies/cs-grupo-bimbo.pdf">Grupo Bimbo</a> is a great example of a business that transformed their help desk on the ServiceNow platform. Grupo Bimbo is the world's largest baking company headquartered in Mexico. With operations in 22 countries, the company boasts of brands such as Dempster's, Sara Lee and Tia Rosa.</p><p></p><p>Grupo Bimbo had outsourced management of IT services and infrastructure. This outsourced firm was using a legacy ticketing system to manage the help desk. The breaking point came when Grupo Bimbo changed their password reset policy.   It resulted in 14,000 calls per month to the help desk which resulted in long wait times for callers and a very unsatisfying user.   With only 40% of calls answered within the target time, service level agreements were out the window. But Grupo Bimbo did not pick a battle with the outsourcer.   They seized the opportunity and radically turned things around.
