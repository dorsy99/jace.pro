<p><span style="color: #181818; background: white;">"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail." </span></p><p style="padding-left: 240px;"><span style="color: #181818;"><em>—Benjamin Franklin</em></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Since the Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit is held just outside of Washington, D.C., the Ben Franklin quote seemed particularly appropriate. As I've been attending sessions here, I try to relate the topics back to ServiceNow Security Operations. Sometimes it's really obvious, like yesterday's mentions of automation and vulnerability response. And some days, like today, I have to work a little harder to make that connection.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Today I got more details from Gartner analysts on the current big bads of security: DDoS and ransomware. Now you might ask how Security Operations could stop either of those types of attacks, and it's true that as an Enterprise Security Response engine, we don't prevent them, but we can help you respond faster and reduce your attack surface. If you read <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=f98d6669dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619cd">yesterday's post</a>, you'll recall that perfection (keeping all the good stuff in and the bad stuff out) in unachievable, so how do we reach good enough?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Let's start with DDoS. Attacks are becoming increasingly large, reaching over 600Gbps, according to Gartner analyst Lawrence Orans. They're also very easy to launch with a variety of free or inexpensive DDoS stressers available. Simply enter the target IP, port, duration, and method, and even an unskilled attacker can now launch a basic volumetric attack. (The other type of DDoS attack—application based—require more skill and are less common as a result.)</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Volumetric attacks leverage botnets for distribution, and there are plenty available. Nearly 52% of Internet traffic comes from bots, according to data from Imperva. Of those bots, more than half are considered bad bots. </span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Denial of Service Dog.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="27ee2886db949344e9737a9e0f96194a.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><a title="efcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-presentations/Bransfeild/DEFCON-22-Gene-Bransfield-Weaponizing-your-Pets-UPDATED.pdf" href="https://defcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-presentations/Bransfeild/DEFCON-22-Gene-Bransfield-Weaponizing-your-Pets-UPDATED.pdf">Denial of Service Dog from DEF CON 22.</a> Way cuter than a bot.</em></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Not only are DDoS attacks increasingly common, but they target all industries from retail to airlines to finance. Even K-12 school districts have been hit by DDoS attacks—it's the modern equivalent of pulling the fire alarm or phoning in a bomb threat (yes, that happened during finals week when I was in high school).</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Orans listed a number of mitigation techniques organizations can use to prevent DDoS attacks. These include using scrubbing centers to block the bad traffic and let the good traffic through. An organization might have their own scrubbing centers or use one via their ISP. Another option is a content delivery network (CDN) that includes a web application firewall, bot management, and managed DNS.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">But what happens if a DDoS attack succeeds? You need to be ready to "push the button," said Orans. That's quickly redirecting traffic to a scrubber. A predetermined plan must already be in place so precious time isn't wasted discussing what to do when an attack occurs. Another option is to have a "Plan B" website, one without large documents or text search boxes that are often targeted in DDoS attacks. External and internal communication plans should also be in place to prevent reputation damage. For example, do your many non-security employees understand the difference between DDoS and a breach?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Here's where ServiceNow could help. If that predetermined response plan were a workflow, you could use automation and orchestration to implement the plan quickly. It could include sending approval to a change group to initiate the plan that will then automatically "push the button" to redirect to the scrubber or publish the alternate website. It could also simultaneously notify public-facing employees and management so they know what is going on and what not to say.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Advanced planning was also advised by Gartner analyst Ian McShane in his session on ransomware. If I were to give you a tl;dr summary of the session recommendations, it would come down to three things: Update, patch, and plan!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;"><strong>Update</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">You've likely paid for the latest in endpoint protection, but is your software actually up to date? Have you enabled new features and recommended settings? Make sure you're getting your money's worth out of your endpoint protection product.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;"><strong>Patch</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Known vulnerabilities are primarily to blame for successful ransomware attacks. Patching is the best way to reduce that attack surface, and it's another place where ServiceNow can assist. The Vulnerability Response application in Security Operations can help you identify and respond to vulnerabilities affecting critical services. And don't forget leveraging SLAs for patching so vulnerabilities don't linger.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;"><strong>Plan</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">How will you handle an attack? Isolate the machine, revert to a backup (assuming it wasn't also damaged by ransomware), rebuild and recover? Just like in the DDoS example, here's where having that plan as a ServiceNow workflow is beneficial. You can automate the plan for faster response and test it in advance of problems.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">To be clear, Gartner analysts do not endorse any vendors in these sessions but are instead telling attendees what they should look for in a solid solution. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #181818;">Want to see ServiceNow automation and orchestration in action?
