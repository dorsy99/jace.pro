<p>To streamline business processes, organizations are looking at ways to automate and improve upon as many manual processes as possible.</p><p></p><p>For example, the annual company picnic is coming up, and management wants you to improve the haphazard process for making the food order, given that the track record for the last three years has been less than stellar:</p><ul><li>1st annual picnic<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18.6667px;">—</span>Too much food was ordered. The leftovers could have fed half an army.</li><li>2nd annual picnic<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18.6667px;">—</span>Not enough food was ordered. Stomachs were growling.</li><li>3rd annual picnic<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18.6667px;">—</span>Enough food was ordered, but every sandwich contained meat. The vegetarians in the crowd, including the CEO, were peeved.</li></ul><p></p><p>How can you ensure that the 4th annual picnic will be a success and the food will be a hit? Two words: ServiceNow Forms. In the platform you can build custom forms and tables for capturing and storing data. Why not <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/form-administration/concept/c_FormDesign.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/form-administration/concept/c_FormDesign.html">create a form </a>that employees can fill out to indicate their food preferences, and then run a report and use it to order the food? Great idea<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">—</span>if you do it right.</p><p></p><p>In this latest installment of our <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/content?filterID=all~objecttype~objecttype%5Bblogpost%5D&amp;filterID=all~tag%5Bnowsupport+best+practices+series%5D&amp;query=nowsupport+best+practices" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">best practices series</a><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">, we look at an example of how choosing the correct <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/reference-pages/reference/r_FieldTypes.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/reference-pages/reference/r_FieldTypes.html">field types</a> impacts the quality of data entered in forms, and thus the resulting tables and reports.</span></p><p></p><h2>Choosing <em>incorrect</em> field types</h2><p>To address your picnic challenge, you design a form to collect food preferences from employees. For each food item, you provide a list of the available options, and users can enter text to describe exactly what they want. How could this go wrong?</p><p></p><p>But notice that all the fields on the form are the <em>string</em> (text entry) type:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="0423dc46db949fc068c1fb651f9619da.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 257px;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;">This form would collect the data, as expected:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_2.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="b2dfe335db1c1fc068c1fb651f961942.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 150px;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p>But the values would be so inconsistent that it would be impossible to generate a useful report. Items would have to be manually tallied for the shopping list, which defeats the purpose of automating the process.</p><p></p><h2>Choosing the <em>correct</em> field types</h2><p>Seeing the error of your ways, you design a new form — but this time you provide users with choice lists for food items with multiple options, and true/false fields for the optional sandwich toppings. Because you choose the correct field type for each form field, the form and list look like this:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_3.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="576c194edb1cd344e9737a9e0f9619a4.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 322px;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_4.jpg" class="image-4 jive-image" src="e0583402dbd89304b322f4621f961980.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 175px;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p>Controlling the values entered into the form allows you to create useful reports. In this example, the report facilitates ordering ingredients for making sandwiches in batches:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_5.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="387754c6db589fc068c1fb651f961954.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 440px;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_6.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" src="6e07f779db90d3049c9ffb651f9619ff.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 444px;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><h1>Form field type best practices</h1><p>Certain field types are better than others for particular kinds of data. Before creating form fields, consider what kind of data will be entered in the form and what you want to do with that data. Also, become familiar with the available field types, so that you can select the best type to capture the expected data and process it to provide meaningful information.</p><p></p><h2>Examples of form field types</h2><ul><li>Use string fields if consistent data is not required and you want to provide flexibility for users to respond however they want to:</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_7 copy.jpg" class="image-7 jive-image" src="5dfa598edbd0d7041dcaf3231f96195d.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><ul><li>Use choice lists, reference fields, or other variable types to constrain options and prevent typos and spelling variations that often occur in string fields. For example, choice lists let users select from a pre-defined list of options:</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_8.jpg" class="image-8 jive-image" src="5ec67c42dbdc57049c9ffb651f9619ba.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><ul><li>Use reference fields to allow users to select data from a field in another table in the instance. Here, Jonathon selects his name from the <strong>Name</strong> field on the User [sys_user] table:</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_9.jpg" class="image-9 jive-image" src="0ac89c46db989fc068c1fb651f961913.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 68px;"/></p><p></p><ul><li>Use true/false fields to indicate binary responses such as true/false, yes/no, or agree/disagree. These fields appear as check boxes that the user selects or clears:</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="company_picnic_10.jpg" class="image-10 jive-image" src="42ca3331db54d3041dcaf3231f96198f.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>What can you do if you need to change the field type <em>after</em> a form is in production?</h2><p>Changing a field type after the form is in production is not recommended because it can result in data loss. Instead, create a new field with the correct type and migrate the data from the old field to the new field. Then do one of the following:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Delete the old field if it won't have negative impact, for example on users who have created reports with the old field.</li><li>Adjust security rules to prevent users from creating new reports with the old field.</li><li>Re-label the field to something like "OLD FIELD—do not use!"</li></ul><p>If you must change a field type, follow the guidelines in <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/data-dictionary-tables/reference/r_ValidDataTypeChanges.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/data-dictionary-tables/reference/r_ValidDataTypeChanges.html">Valid data type changes</a>.</p><p></p><p>For more information, see:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/form-administration/task/t_ChangeFormContent.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/form-administration/task/t_ChangeFormContent.html">Change or create a new form</a></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/field-administration/task/t_SpecifyingADefaultValue.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/field-administration/task/t_SpecifyingADefaultValue.html">Specify a default field value</a></li></ul><p></p><p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit;">--</p><p></p><p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit;">Behind the scenes here at ServiceNow, the Knowledge Management and Multimedia teams work closely with subject matter experts to disseminate critical information to our customers.
