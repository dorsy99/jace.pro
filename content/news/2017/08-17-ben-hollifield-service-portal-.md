<p>At <a title="w.yansa.io/" href="http://www.yansa.io/">Yansa Labs</a>, we get really excited about pushing Service Portal to its limits, and we believe in the idea that people want to do amazing new things in their Portals. To that end, we've built a great <a title="w.yansa.io/yds/" href="http://www.yansa.io/yds/">collection of elements and widgets</a> to supercharge any Portal project.</p><p></p><p>Recently, though, our customers have asked us to step back. In addition to cool new widgets, we need to also refine existing Portal components in places like the Service Catalog. To that end, we have added a series of widgets and fixes to improve the baseline Service Portal as part of the Yansa Design System. Some examples of this are:</p><p></p><ul><li>The ability to define additional display/search fields on Reference &amp; List Collector variables in Catalog</li></ul><p><img   alt="CatalogItemAdditionalFieldsDesktop1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="351" src="d6dbbc06db1c9304b322f4621f9619cb.iix" style="height: 351px; width: 623.16px;" width="623"/></p><ul><li>Improving the layout of reference field displays within the Form view</li></ul><p><img   alt="FormAdditionalFieldsDesktop1.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="bfc65486db989704ed6af3231f9619bb.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;"/></p><ul><li>An improved solution to render Catalog Items and Order Guides with all variable sets and containers, but without the scroll bars that typically come with iFrames</li></ul><p><img   alt="CatalogItemIframeDesktop1.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="627c33b9db94d3049c9ffb651f961951.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;"/></p><p></p><p>All of these enhancements are driven by requests from the user community, and we'd like to add many more.</p><p></p><p>So, what is it that really grinds your gears about existing Service Portal components?</p><p></p><p>How can we make it better?</p><p></p><p>If you have ideas that you think will benefit the Service Portal community, please let us know! Your contributions will drive new components to help us all build better Service Portals.</p><p></p><p><span>Please reach out to me with any suggestions at </span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:ben@yansa.io">ben@yansa.io</a><span>, or here in the comment thread.
