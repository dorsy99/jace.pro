This included ensuring operational stability and reliable service delivery. They also faced the challenge of having IT split into separate functions — Corporate IT and Regional IT. Each group had its own processes, legacy systems and roadmaps. This resulted in duplication, complexity and inefficiency — and ultimately compromised operational stability.</p><p></p><p>To address these challenges, they reached out to ServiceNow. The ServiceNow Inspire team worked with them to create consistency across IT groups, simplify IT service delivery, and increase IT effectiveness. ServiceNow also helped their IT team to embrace self-service, create financial transparency, and eliminate service outages. After a short 7 months, they went live with ITSM, ITOM and ITBM.</p><p></p><p>This allowed them to achieve high-value results, such as:</p><ul><li>Dramatically increasing the accuracy of its CMDB using ServiceNow Discovery</li><li>Creating financial transparency with ServiceNow IT Financial Management — including active budgeting, budget plan process reviews, and integration with SAP</li><li>Taking effective control of its Microsoft and Adobe software licenses — using ServiceNow Software Asset Management to visually assess available and installed licenses</li><li>Creating visibility of its top 14 business services using ServiceNow Service Mapping</li><li>Minimizing downtime of critical business services by actively visualizing business service health with ServiceNow Event Management</li></ul><p></p><p><span style="color: #3d3d3d;">Learn more about how ServiceNow can help you:</span></p><p><a title="ww.servicenow.com/solutions/improve-it-service-delivery.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/improve-it-service-delivery.html">Modernize IT Service Management</a></p><p><a title="ww.servicenow.com/solutions/prevent-service-outages.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/prevent-service-outages.html">Eliminate Service Outages</a></p><p><a title="ww.servicenow.com/solutions/align-it-demand-to-business-strategy.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/align-it-demand-to-business-strategy.html">Take Control of Apps, Projects and Financials</a></p>
