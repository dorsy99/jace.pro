<p>The ServiceNow product documentation site, <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/">docs.servicenow.com</a>, is where you can go to learn everything about how the Now platform and its features work. Whether you're on the Istanbul release or you've just taken the latest patch, ServiceNow documentation helps you find out what's new in the product, what's fixed, and how to use ServiceNow to get your job done.</p><p></p><p>Besides documenting every application, feature, patch, and hot fix for the Now platform, the product documentation team also works hard to make your experience with our doc site better. We've recently added features to make using our content easier and we've fixed a few bugs. Here are some highlights.</p><p></p><h1>What's New on the Product Documentation site</h1><p></p><h3>Mini Table of Contents</h3><p>The biggest piece of feedback we've heard is that we need more content on our doc pages. To support our efforts to address that feedback, we've introduced mini tables of contents (TOCs) on longer pages with multiple headings.</p><p></p><p>The table of contents expands and contracts as you scroll — and it's sticky. It stays with you no matter where you are on the page.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img  alt="mini-toc-blog-post.png" class="image-7 jive-image" src="470dc04edbdcdb048c8ef4621f9619db.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 437px;"/></p><h3>Time stamps to indicate when topics are last updated</h3><p>You want to know how "fresh" our content is, so we've provided time stamps to show when something has been updated.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="last-updated.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="b0bc40c6db1417049c9ffb651f9619ac.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 225px;"/></p><h3>The end to Dead End searches</h3><p>If you misspell a word in a search query, it's frustrating to get the dreaded "No results" page. We've rolled out "Did you mean…?" to help you avoid dead-end searches. For example, search for "mild" and we'll suggest "MID" (as in MID Server) if no content matches "mild." We'll continue to tune and refine "Did you mean…?" to make it more and more useful over time.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="did-you-mean.png" class="image-6 jive-image" src="48b8ef35dbd41fc068c1fb651f96198b.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 254px;"/></p><p></p><p></p><h1></h1><h1>Fixed on the Product Documentation site</h1><p></p><table border="1" class="jiveBorder" style="border: 1px solid #c6c6c6; width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th style="text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2; color: #505050; padding: 6px;" valign="middle"><strong>Problem<br/></strong></th><th style="text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2; color: #505050; padding: 6px;" valign="middle"><strong>Resolution</strong></th></tr><tr><td style="padding: 6px;">Left navigation menu (table of contents) does not stay minimized when you navigate from page to page.</td><td style="padding: 6px;">The left navigation menu stays minimized when you navigate to another page.
