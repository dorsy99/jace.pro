"In the majority of cases digital transformation forms part of the corporate strategy with the CEO playing a key role. Unfortunately, the IT department itself is not always ready for it, with only one in five companies putting the IT organization in a strong leadership position to have the 'digital conversion'." The top takeaways of Carter presented were:</p><ul><li>Focus on the development of the IT organization and its talent</li><li>Transform the IT infrastructure and operations</li><li>Focus on service and program management and of course innovation</li></ul><p></p><p>Two Belgian customers also presented, namely Arnaud Pire, Senior Manager IT, Service Delivery, Operations from Toyota Motor Europe on "Service Management Sharing TME Experience" and Vincent Lamote, Head of Operations Investments Services, from ING Belgium on "Empowering People to Stay Ahead in Life and Business". The presentations are attached to this blog post and can be downloaded.</p><p></p><p>Quoting Arnaud Pire, Toyota Motor Europe <span class="s1">"Service Management is a continuous journey.
