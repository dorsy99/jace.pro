<p>After a brief hiatus, I'm back on the group.   For those of you who don't know, I'm no longer with Seton Hall University.   I decided to throw my hat into the ServiceNow Consulting arena.   I am currently a Senior Principal Consultant at Pathways Consulting Group, a ServiceNow Silver Partner.</p><p></p><p>I'm looking forward to connecting back with many of you!</p><p></p><p>Jeff</p>
