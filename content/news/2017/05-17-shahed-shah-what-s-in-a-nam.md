<p>It&#39;s all well and good when you know various URL tricks to navigate around the UI, like <a class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" title="Getting your ServiceNow URLs right" href="/community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;710daaa5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619e8" rel="nofollow">Getting your ServiceNow URLs right</a>, <a title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/use/navigation/reference/r_NavigatingByURLExamples.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/use/navigation/reference/r_NavigatingByURLExamples.html" rel="nofollow">Examples of navigating by URL</a>, <a title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/navigate-by-portal-url.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/navigate-by-portal-url.html" rel="nofollow">Navigate by portal URL</a>, and more ), but do you really know what&#39;s happening behind the scenes when you request a resource from ServiceNow? Nooo. No, no, no. I&#39;m not talking about the Client/Server Model. What I&#39;m talking about is when you make a request like <a title="nstancename.servicenow.com/incident_list.do" href="https://instancename.servicenow.com/incident_list.do" rel="nofollow">https://instancename.servicenow.com/incident_list.do</a>, do you really know what that process is for the Instance to bring back a list of records on the Incident table? Or even why the list is not displaying at all when it should (yes, we have received these Incidents)?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-9 jive-image" style="width: 620px; height: 86px;" src="e9cab375db901304b322f4621f96196a.iix" alt="Address&#43;Bar.jpg" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is important to understand what questions are being answered when calling a list of records as to avoid a disaster like hindering your users from getting the information they need. You wouldn&#39;t want to prevent your employees from utilizing the platform&#39;s system and data because you created a UI page called <em>incident</em>. Would you? I didn&#39;t think so. Let&#39;s discuss how this process works so that your company continues to function efficiently.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>How an Instance knows what to display</h1>
<p>There is, indeed, a process. Similar to how<a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual-security/concept/access-control-rules.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/administer/contextual-security/concept/access-control-rules.html" rel="nofollow"> Access Control Rules</a> work, the platform is trying to answer a few questions. As soon as there is an answer, the platform stops asking the other questions and renders the respective output for what it just found. Here&#39;s the questions in their respective sequence:</p>
<ol><li>Is it a Processor?</li><li>Is it a UI Page?</li><li>Is it a File-based Jelly form template?</li><li>Is it a table?</li><li>Is it a table with a suffix?</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<h2>Is it a Processor?</h2>
<p><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/script/processors/concept/c_Processors.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/script/processors/concept/c_Processors.html" rel="nofollow">Processors</a> are endpoints that would allow you to run arbitrary Javascript code (server-side) and can make calls to Java classes. For example, if you watch the HTTP requests in the browser console, you&#39;re probably seeing quite a few angular.do transactions and wondering where they go. Go ahead and navigate to the <strong>System Definition &gt; Processor</strong> module (or, if you live by efficiency, head to the <strong>sys_processor</strong> table), then filter the list with <strong>[Path] [is] [angular]</strong>. Done? Or are you waiting for me to give the answer?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will see a record with the name <strong>AngularProcessor</strong>. In that record, you will see that the <strong>Type</strong> is <strong>java</strong> and the <strong>Class name</strong> is <strong>com.glide.ui.ng.AngularProcessor</strong>. This particular processor will execute some Java code found in the specified class name, which in this case is <strong>com.glide.ui.ng.AngularProcessor</strong>. We are interacting with processors almost every day and probably don&#39;t even realise it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Want another example? Sure. Attachments! Yup. Have you ever noticed that when you&#39;re looking at records in the <strong>sys_attachment</strong> table, you click on a record but the file is downloaded instead of being taken to the record? If you don&#39;t believe me, head over to the sys_attachment table and filter it with <strong>[Path] [is] [sys_attachment]</strong>. See? Told you. The reason why you didn&#39;t get to the record is that the processor question is right at the top of the list of questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Is it a UI Page?</h2>
<p>If the platform cannot answer &#34;yes&#34; to the processor question it heads to the next one &#34;Is it a UI Page?&#34; That&#39;s right... <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/script/server-scripting/reference/r_UIPages.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/script/server-scripting/reference/r_UIPages.html" rel="nofollow">UI Pages</a>. Let&#39;s take an example of viewing a Catalog Item or Record Producer. Looking at the URL you will see <strong>com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do</strong>. Kinda looks like it may be a processor, right? Go ahead and look for it in the <strong>sys_processor</strong> table like before (without the .do). Didn&#39;t find it? That&#39;s okay. Let&#39;s have a look in the <strong>sys_ui_page</strong> table, but this time searching on the <strong>Name</strong> column: <strong>[Name] [is] [com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view]</strong>. You should now have a record in the list, where you can now inspect the Jelly code of how Catalog Items/Record Producers are rendered. Have a look around and you will probably find some other familiar UI Pages or create your own.</p>
<p> </p>
<table class="jiveBorder" style="border: 1px solid #c6c6c6; width: 100%; background-color: #c4c4c4;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 20px; padding: 6px;"><img class="image-3 jive-image" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; width: 18px; height: 18.75px;" src="00771c0adbd817049c9ffb651f961984.iix" alt="rodentia-icons_dialog-information-300px.png" width="18" height="19" /></td><td style="padding: 6px;">You could try to create a UI Page with the name of sys_attachment, but the processor will still take precedence.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>Not sure when this was introduced, but there is another way to call up a UI Page. There is another field on the table called <span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">Endpoint</span>, which would contain the scope and the name to call the UI Page.</p>
<p>For example let&#39;s say there is a UI Page in the HR scope called <span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">checklist_dialog</span>, the endpoint would be <span style="font-family: &#39;courier new&#39;, courier;">sn_hr_core_checklist_dialog.do</span>.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for this in case you are having issues within a scoped app.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Is it a file-based Jelly form template?</h2>
<p>Next up, is Jelly code which is stored as XML files on the Application Server. Jelly pretty much behaves like UI Pages, but you cannot reach the actual code and touch it. For example, whenever you navigate to <strong>Reports &gt; View / Run</strong>, the URL for the Reports homepage will look like <strong>report_home.do</strong>. Go ahead a look for this in the <strong>sys_processor</strong> and <strong>sys_ui_page</strong> tables. No? This will be stored in a folder on the Application Server as <strong>report_home.xml</strong>. Sorry, people, but:</p>
<p><img class="image-1 jive-image" style="width: 516px; height: 285.465px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="9e48b04adbdc5f048c8ef4621f9619e2.iix" alt="MC Hammer - Can&#39;t touch this.gif" width="516" height="285" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(I&#39;m so sorry. I couldn&#39;t resist.)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<table class="jiveBorder" style="border: 1px solid #c6c6c6; width: 100%; background-color: #c4c4c4;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 20px; padding: 6px;"><img class="image-4 jive-image" style="height: 19px; width: 19px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" src="ce077b79dbdcdfc0b322f4621f9619e1.iix" alt="qubodup-Cubikopp-smilies-7-300px.png" width="19" height="19" /></td><td style="padding: 6px;">You could try to create a UI Page with the name of report_home, but that will override the File-based template call... and that would be bad! Just sayin&#39; &#34;don&#39;t do it&#34;.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<h2>Is it a table?</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s take that first example I started with: <strong>incident_list.do</strong>. You can run through the first set of questions and verify that:</p>
<ol><li>It&#39;s not a Processor</li><li>It&#39;s not a UI Page</li><li>It&#39;s not a File-based Jelly form template</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Cool. Now, we know that the first part of this URL snippet starts with Incident, which is a table right? Yes. However, this will not pass the &#34;Is it a table?&#34; check. Why? Because the platform will be looking for &#34;incident_list&#34; in <strong>sys_db_object</strong>, the table for tables, and we know there is no table called &#34;incident_list&#34; in an OOB Instance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, I provided the URL with <strong>incident.do</strong>, the platform will respond with a &#34;yes&#34; and display a record for this table. So, I will be presented with an existing Incident if there is a <strong>sys_id</strong> parameter that&#39;s not <strong>-1</strong>. If the <strong>sys_id</strong> parameter is not there, or has a -1 value, you will be presented with a blank form to create a record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While I&#39;m here, I should also point out that there is another place that the platform looks, which is the <strong>Database Views [sys_db_view]</strong> table. For example, taking the OOB <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_DatabaseViews.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_DatabaseViews.html" rel="nofollow">database view</a> called incident_metric, I will get a &#34;Yes, this is a table&#34; from the platform.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Is it a table with a suffix?</h2>
<p>Finally, I can get a &#34;yes&#34; from the platform with the <strong>incident_list.do</strong> URL <strong>AND</strong> get the list of Incidents!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-5 jive-image" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 203px; width: 108.267px;" src="0dfa910edb1c1b04ed6af3231f9619c3.iix" alt="egore-Thumb-Up--300px.png" width="108" height="203" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Oh yeah!)</span></p>
<p>If the platform got here for incident_list, the questions list would look like:</p>
<ol><li>&#34;incident_list&#34; is not a Processor</li><li>&#34;incident_list&#34; is not a UI Page</li><li>&#34;incident_list&#34; is not a file-based Jelly form template</li><li>&#34;incident_list&#34; is not a Table</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<p>To answer &#34;Is it a table with a suffix?&#34; the platform looks for any suffix at the end of the string. As an example, we have &#34;_list&#34;, then there&#39;s &#34;_search&#34; (used when creating a <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/administer/navigation-and-ui/reference/r_ModuleLinkTypes.html#r_ModuleLinkTypes" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/administer/navigation-and-ui/reference/r_ModuleLinkTypes.html#r_ModuleLinkTypes" rel="nofollow">Search Screen module</a>) and a couple of others. Any text before this suffix will be taken and searched for using the logic in Question 4 (Is it a table?).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>---</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To recap, the platform will look at the following to answer those questions:</p>
<ul><li>sys_processor (using the <strong>path</strong> field)</li><li>sys_ui_page (using the <strong>name</strong> field)</li><li>File system (using the file name followed by .xml)</li><li>sys_db_object, sys_db_view (using the <strong>name</strong> field)</li><li>sys_db_object, sys_db_view (using the <strong>path</strong> field plus suffix0</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Taking the example of the &#34;incident_list&#34; URL, we will get a response like:</p>
<ol><li>Is it a Processor? <span style="color: #e23d39;"><strong>X</strong></span></li><li>Is it a UI Page? <span style="color: #e23d39;"><strong>X</strong></span></li><li>Is it a File-based Jelly form template? <span style="color: #e23d39;"><strong>X</strong></span></li><li>Is it a table? <span style="color: #e23d39;"><strong>X</strong></span></li><li>Is it a table with a suffix? <span style="color: #24a819;"><strong>✔</strong></span></li></ol>
<p> </p>
<p>If you&#39;ve got something in the URL that fails all these questions, in the end you will get the usual &#34;Page not found&#34; message:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-8 jive-image" style="width: 620px; height: 130px;" src="e9c85c46db989fc068c1fb651f9619da.iix" alt="page&#43;not&#43;found.jpg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Hello again)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There you have it. Some developers/consultants have created things further up in the list with the same name and end up in a situation where you can no longer access something further down, like a table. This is referred to as overriding and a typical scenario is to create a UI Page to override the File system check or they fail to check if something already exists with that name.</p>
<p> </p>
<table class="jiveBorder" style="border: 1px solid #c6c6c6; width: 100%; background-color: #c4c4c4;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 20px; padding: 6px;"><img class="image-4 jive-image" style="height: 19px; width: 19px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" src="ce077b79dbdcdfc0b322f4621f9619e1.iix" alt="qubodup-Cubikopp-smilies-7-300px.png" width="19" height="19" /></td><td style="padding: 6px;">If you&#39;re not careful, you could create a situation where users cannot get to the functionality/data that they need (like creating a UI Page called incident ).</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<p>However, if you have a situation where you&#39;re trying to find where that <strong>name.do</strong> belongs, you will have some places to look. For those who want to have a further in depth look at the logic, a while back, I put together a script that you can run in <strong>Scripts - Background (sys.scripts.do)</strong> for Customer Support to troubleshoot related issues (see attachment below). A quick note: I could not find a GlideScriptable function call for the file system check, so that bit is missing (there is a way to do it using undocumented Package calls, but that goes against my personal rule and I am purposely not sharing that to minimize risk).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, in the famous words of Porky Pig:</p>
