<p>Here's the dilemma of the day - you're developing applications on your DEVelopment instance, and you need to clone your PRODuction instance to your DEV instance to test the changes. But here's the catch - one or more of those applications are still in-development. What should you do?</p><p></p><p>Let's say you throw caution to the wind and start the clone anyway. When the clone is complete and you refresh your DEV instance (clone target) from PRODuction (clone source), you find that the in-development applications are completely missing or are the wrong versions on the target instance, post-clone. Arg! What happened? In this sixth installment of our best practices series, we look at three different ways you can preserve those in-development apps.</p><p></p><h2>What happens to in-development applications when you clone over the development instance</h2><p>After a clone, the target instance will have whatever version of the application the source instance had when cloned. For example, if the source had the latest version, the target will have the latest version post-clone. The source will still be a sys_app (sys_store_app applications are read-only) application, meaning it can be developed further. However, if the latest application version is 1.2 and the clone source has version 1.1, the post-clone target will have a developable application that is version 1.1, the same as the source instance. If the clone source has no version of the application installed, the target will, likewise, have no version of the application available post-clone.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Post-clone development best practices</h2><p>If you have applications in development on an instance that will be used as a clone target, before cloning to that instance, do one of the following with all of your in-development applications to allow continued post-clone development:</p><ul><li>Save the application to source control (<a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_SourceControlIntegration.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_SourceControlIntegration.html">git hub integration in Studio, available starting in Helsinki</a> ). Then restore the application to the target instance from the source control repository after the clone.</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="source_control.JPG" class="image-1 jive-image" src="d1ba910edbd813043eb27a9e0f961940.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 279px;"/></p><ul><li>Publish the application to an update set, and install it back to the target instance, post-clone.</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="publish_to_update_set.JPG" class="image-2 jive-image" src="7e86b0c2dbdcd704ed6af3231f96199c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 283px;"/></p><ul><li>Install the most recent version of the application to the source instance prior to the clone.</li></ul><p></p><p>Dilemma solved - Â  you can clone your PROD instance <strong><em>and</em></strong> keep your fledgling apps.
