It was great finally meeting so many of you.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; color: #373a3c;">Due to overwhelming demand, we are releasing the Presentation and Update Set for the theme we built during the breakout. To keep things simple, I've rebuilt the Update Set to not modify any of the out-of-box records and instead create new records. Also keep in mind this theme only styles the homepage and does not alter the content or layout.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; color: #373a3c;">Click here to get access to the theme: <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="https://serviceportal.io/free-service-portal-theme/" rel="nofollow" style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #3778c7;" target="_blank">https://serviceportal.io/free-service-portal-theme/</a></p>
