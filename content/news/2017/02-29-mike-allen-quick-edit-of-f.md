<p>Wanted to share a quick thing I stumbled upon recently.   People were lamenting the absence of the frames that UI15 had.   In attempting to open a record in a different tab, I inadvertently held shift instead of ctrl, and, lo and behold, quick forms:</p><p></p><p><img  class="image-1 jive-image" src="ec9be3f5db981fc03eb27a9e0f9619d9.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p></p><p>I have not had a lot of time to play with it, so I don't know what rules are around it, if you can change the view it uses globally, etc, but I thought it was something nice and thought I'd share.</p>
