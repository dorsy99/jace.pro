<p><strong>THIS WEEK!</strong> Special Knowledge17 edition!</p><p></p><p><img alt="k17_logo_cmyk_dates_OC_v3.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="61" src="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-knowledge/knowledge17/images/k17_logo_cmyk_dates_OC_v3.png" style="width: 269px; height: 60.7419px;" width="269"/></p><p></p><p>Knowledge is ServiceNow's premier event for customers for customers by customers. Approximately 15,000 attendees will be onsite for the event - with options to hear fellow customer stories at breakout sessions, make new connections at networking activities, go deeper into the product at labs, be inspired at keynotes (including one dedicated to customer service), <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">and</span> see product demos, partner solutions, and what ServiceNow has for the future in the expo hall. Offering a dedicated track for customer service with most sessions presented by customers, this is a great opportunity to learn from peers - not only in customer service practices but also to hear their journey with ServiceNow.</p><p></p><p>Let me go deeper into three top reasons people attend. If you didn't make it this year, after reading these you will want to mark your calendar for next year!</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Customer Service Showcased</span></h1><p>I mentioned that of the five available tracks at Knowledge17, customer service has its own dedicated track. The majority of the customer service track's breakout sessions are presented by customers telling their stories (more details on that in a moment). Labs demonstrate new ways to deliver highly efficient and lower-cost service to customers and the means of moving more of your customer service from a reactive mode to proactive style. The customer service keynote will also bring several customers onstage to talk about their customer service challenges as well as what led them to consider a service management approach to customer service.</p><p></p><p>What is a service management approach to customer service? You can get introduced (or get greater detail, if you're already familiar) to ServiceNow's unique solution for customer service, including hearing about new developments in ServiceNow Customer Service Management's portfolio of products. The expo hall will offer demos at the pavilion and partners with their solutions will also be present.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Customer-led Sessions</span></h1><p>When we say "customer-led," we mean it. Past Knowledge conferences have shown us what customers want to hear from their peers, and we work with our customer presenters on their presentations to cover such topics as:</p><ul><li>What problems existed in your customer service organization? What were the metrics that identified this?</li><li>What solutions did you consider?</li><li>What were your goals with adopting a new solution?</li><li>What challenges did you have in moving to a new customer service solution?</li><li>How did you get buy-in and acceptance from customer service employees, as well as the rest of your organization?</li><li>Where are you currently in your journey?</li><li>What goals have you realized (and how have your metrics improved) and what goals are you still working to achieve?</li><li>... and more!</li></ul><p></p><p>As you can see, these are issues not only related to the use of a solution but also the barriers in the business to providing outstanding service. The stories you hear might sound familiar to your own challenges and offer new ideas for solving them.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Networking Opportunities</span></h1><p>By the nature of events such as these, there is always plenty of time to converse with fellow customer service practitioners around tables at breakout sessions, working cooperatively in labs, sitting together at meals, and during the many social events occurring at night. Beyond these casual opportunities Knowledge17 offers a few formal occasions intended to get you connected and conversing with others:</p><ul><li><strong>TableTalks</strong> - Tables have been dedicated at lunch to discuss topics related to customer service, field service, and knowledge management. Moderated by ServiceNow employees, this is a great chance to discuss common customer service challenges while exchanging contact info. And you get your lunch earlier than others!</li><li><strong>SIG Bingo</strong> - You might win a prize playing Bingo at the customer service SIG (or "Special Interest Group")! Sit with customer service colleagues and enjoy three rounds of play, answering questions to mark out spots on your Bingo card for a chance to win while hearing how customer services problems were tackled.</li></ul><p></p><p>If you are attending the conference this week, make sure you register for these, as space is limited.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">See You Next Year?</span></h1><p>I hope I'll get to meet you this week in Orlando! If you didn't make it to Knowledge17 this year, there are many reasons above to consider attending next year. This is truly a great event to hear how real companies and their customer service champions are solving their challenges with a new approach to customer service. And whether you attended or not, it's not too early to start putting your case together to <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-knowledge/knowledge17/documents/Justify.Your.Trip.docx" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-knowledge/knowledge17/documents/Justify.Your.Trip.docx">justify the trip</a> next year!</p>
