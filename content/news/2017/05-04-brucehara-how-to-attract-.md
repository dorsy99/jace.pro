<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a title="w.enableps.com.au/products/" href="http://www.enableps.com.au/products/">Enable's product business</a> is launching 5 new applications for the ServiceNow store in time for K17 and we'll be showcasing these at booth number # 532 in the exhibition hall. </span></p><p></p><p>The first app we want to tell you about is Talent Enabler - it is disrupting the talent and HR tech space by combining streamlined recruitment processes with powerful talent analytics into one intuitive solution.</p><p></p><p>Is your technology helping you attract and keep top talent? Or is it just not working? If you are unsure, you are not alone! Thousands of organisations are using outdated, time consuming systems and processes to identify, screen and match talent for their roles. In the age of social media, cloud computing and advanced business applications, no-one can afford to stick with this approach.</p><p></p><p><strong>So, what are your main challenges?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1. Talent teams are using multiple sources of talent pools on any given day</strong></p><p>Most organisations have disparate systems<span lang="EN-AU" style="font-family: 'Corbel',sans-serif;">—</span>for example, external facing applicant tracking systems (like Taleo), internal RMS systems and HR ERPs, Seek talent pools, LinkedIn, Monster.com, and other talent and HR tools for sourcing and selecting talent. This scattered approach screams inefficiency and doesn't offer a true picture of the entire resource pool. It really just relies on an individual's tool preference, search skills and role priority. </p><p></p><p><strong>2. The speed and accuracy of matching mostly depend on human effort, and it's costly</strong></p><p>Talent teams most rely on human interactions and decisions to select, match and rank their talent. Inefficient, this approach can also cause ongoing issues around diversity and unconscious bias. </p><p></p><p><strong>3. Employee failure to launch is a risk</strong></p><p>Companies spend way too much money on recruitment processes and still have failed employee placements. Even more costly, recruitment does not guarantee the employee will work out for the company. </p><p></p><p><strong>Enter Talent Enabler … </strong></p><p>Imagine having one application that covers ALL your internal and external talent tools. The Enable <span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 8.0pt;"><a title=":/Users/bruce/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/V55TOEFQ/BLOGS%20-%20Enable%20Talent%20Enabler%20RD20170503.docx#_msocom_1" href="file:///C:/Users/bruce/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/V55TOEFQ/BLOGS%20-%20Enable%20Talent%20Enabler%20RD20170503.docx#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1">[RD1]</a> </span>team has the answer: Talent Enabler. This app integrates with your existing ServiceNow portal and HR modules, Taleo, LinkedIn, Seek and any internal databases that your organisation uses to identify talent.   </p><p> <img  class="image-1 jive-image" height="377" src="36d6494adb5497049c9ffb651f9619ec.iix" style="width: 490px; height: 376.713px;" width="490"/></p><p></p><p>At a click of a button, you can search ALL talent inside and outside the organisation based on clever APIs that directly link to candidates' or employees' external profiles. In other words, Talent Enabler removes the need for an administrator or individual to update employment and skill details on your internal system. </p><div>   <p><strong>Even better news</strong></p><p>So, the app gives you total visibility to the depth of talent available.
