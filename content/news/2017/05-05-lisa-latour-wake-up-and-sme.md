He has over 25 years of management and consulting experience in a variety of roles, including:   IT project management, professional services, product management, and account management; and is certified as a Project Management Professional by PMI. Brian specializes in continuous process improvement to deliver customer service excellence and has the uncanny ability to identify weaknesses and breakdown silos within organizations to increase operational efficiency, reduce costs, and increase accountability.</span> </span></p><hr/><p></p><p>I don't know about you — but I love coffee. And I drink lots of it! All day. Every day. But if I had to grind the beans, insert a filter, pour in the water, steam the milk, … I wouldn't have time to get much <strong>work</strong> done. Thank goodness, I have a Keurig machine that does all that work for me.</p><p>I've learned that the best way for me to get more things done—at home and at work—is to automate the mundane. And I spend most of my time seeking opportunities to automate. </p><p></p><p>Just prior to joining ScienceLogic, I led the efforts to automate Kellogg's IT Infrastructure Global Monitoring system, which included completing the global integration of ScienceLogic -&gt; ServiceNow -&gt; xMatters. My team delivered a complete solution for:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Automating events, creating and managing incident tickets, and alerting on business impacting issues to the right support groups—all without human intervention.</li><li>Expanding the capabilities of self-healing and mapping of on-premises infrastructure with all cloud based technologies</li><li>Creating an efficient and tight ITOSM ecosystem which ultimately saved Kellogg's millions of dollars per year.</li></ul><p></p><p>As the new Senior Solutions Architect and IT Operations and Service Management (ITOSM) Product Manager in the Office of the CTO at ScienceLogic, I'm tasked with the creation and continual improvement of our global ITOSM program. I'm also the owner of our Service Desk integration component that provides unparalleled capabilities for achieving a Service Assurance methodology.</p><p></p><p>Since this is the first Knowledge conference I'm attending, I will be immersing myself in all the best practices for IT configuration and asset management, and uncovering creative approaches for knowledge management. I plan on networking with as many people as I can to identify further opportunities for improving service delivery and learning how ScienceLogic can help more organizations get the job done.</p><p></p><p>Join me for two session this week:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>On Tuesday, May 9 from 6:45-7:00 p.m. at M20 in the Exhibitor Hall join me to hear how customers have benefitted by connecting ScienceLogic with ServiceNow in "How Five Customers Benefited From Integrating ScienceLogic with ServiceNow".</li><li>On Wednesday, May 10 from 5:00-5:50 p.m. in TheatreNow Hall D, join me and my colleague to learn how to avoid the pitfalls of automating IT service delivery in "10 Lessons Learned for Automating IT Service Delivery<strong>". </strong></li><li>And don't forget to visit the ScienceLogic booth #209 to talk with me and my colleagues about how to Accelerate &amp; Optimize IT Operations &amp; Service Management (ITOSM) with CMDB &amp; Incident Automation.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>The IT Challenge:</strong></p><p>It's Impossible to Automate with Inaccurate Data.</p><p></p><p>Modern cloud and software-defined technologies are radically altering the way companies do business. Services built with these technologies change by the second and it's impossible to keep pace using traditional approaches. That's why IT is looking for a solution that will allow them to discover everything they have—in real-time.</p><p></p><p>Without accurate data, IT lacks a complete view of the infrastructure. You don't know what you have, if it's working or needs to be fixed, or whether it is (or isn't) in use. It's also impossible to automate IT processes—event, incident, configuration, change, among others—and enable the business to move faster. Success begins with accurate data.</p><p>And a good cup of Joe!</p><p></p><p>Visit our website at <a title="w.sciencelogic.com/" href="http://www.sciencelogic.com/">www.sciencelogic.com</a> and follow me on twitter <a title="witter.com/Brian_A001" href="https://twitter.com/Brian_A001">https://twitter.com/Brian_A001</a></p><p>or on LinkedIn at <span style="color: #0084bf; background: whitesmoke;">linkedin.com/in/brianjamaro</span></p>
