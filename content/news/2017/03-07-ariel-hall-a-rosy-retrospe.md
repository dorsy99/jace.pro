<p>ServiceNow was honored to participate as a platinum sponsor at Pink Elephant's 21<sup>st</sup> Annual ITSM conference at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. It was an intimate show marked by lively discussions, educational sessions, great networking opportunities, and shared words of wisdom — from IT practitioners and motivational speakers alike.</p><p></p><p>There was a strong turnout from the ServiceNow ecosystem, and we were delighted to be joined by a multitude of customers and partners at the event. One such customer—Ohio State University—led a whopping 4 breakout sessions that ranged in topics from Incident and Problem Management to ITIL best practices. We also saw friendly faces presenting from Harvard University, Corning Inc., Brigham Young University, many more.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Bob Gribben_Ohio State_Incident_Problem Mgmt_Pink17.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" height="352" src="a8a7914edbd4d304b322f4621f961991.iix" style="float: right; height: 352px; width: 466.96px;" width="467"/></p><p></p><p>ITSM Product Marketing Manager, Gerald Beaulieu, and Solution Consultant, Ryan Fraser, kicked off the conference with an informative session on ServiceNow's CAB Workbench. The pair showed attendees how they can eliminate the hassles of manually scheduling and managing Change Advisory Board meetings by instead utilizing ServiceNow's automated, collaborative approach and single system of record. Features like automated scheduling, notifications and group chat result in maximized use of employee time, and improved CAB meeting efficiency.</p><p></p><p>On Tuesday, ServiceNow's Udi Gotlieb teamed up with Bob Gribben from Ohio State University for a "lunch and learn" discussion on leveraging ServiceNow to fuel long-term growth. Bob shared his organization's early service desk challenges, and how they used ServiceNow to not only solve those problems, but also push IT's impact and efficiency even further. Now, Ohio State could serve as a poster child for IT service management done right. Their services and processes are well-defined, understood by the customer, and aligned within IT staff. The biggest take away from the session? Never stop improving and get ahead of business demand. Delivering services is a never ending journey that must be met with Continual Service Improvement—an ITIL best practice. And it turns out that ServiceNow was exactly the right solution to help Ohio State achieve this.</p><p></p><p>We would also like to congratulate ServiceNow customer Stephanie Jambor-Trisket, IT Manager and ITSM Program Sponsor of Erie Insurance, for winning the Gold Award for <a title="ww.pinkelephant.com/uploadedfiles/About-Pink/PressReleases/Pink17-IT-Excellence-Award-Winners.pdf" href="https://www.pinkelephant.com/uploadedfiles/About-Pink/PressReleases/Pink17-IT-Excellence-Award-Winners.pdf">Pink Elephant's Practitioner of The Year</a>. This award recognizes an individual who has shown commitment to the principles of best practices, continuous improvement and quality.</p><p></p><p>On the expo floor at Pink17, ServiceNow ITSM experts met with current and potential customers to answer questions and give live theater demonstrations of how we are changing the way people work. Attendees gathered around the booth to learn about transforming the service experience, eliminating outages, improving insight with Performance Analytics, and deploying ServiceNow with ease using ITSM Guided setup up, and much more. A personal favorite was this demonstration from Solution Consultant, Ryan Fraser, about leveraging Visual Task Boards to manage every day work:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">   <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/AeEDu0TjaKM" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p>Perhaps one of the highlights of the conference was having front row seats to the Bellagio Fountain show during ServiceNow's private party at Hyde Nightclub for exclusive Pink17 attendees. ServiceNow customers, prospects, partners and employees joined for an evening of good conversation and fun as we closed out our time in Vegas.<img alt="Hyde%2BNightclub%2BPink17%2B022017.gif" class="image-2 jive-image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NitK-CF7O-Y/WKx4LLZEb2I/AAAAAAAABSg/kvrte5ymcsEBH6NESOTkHX4XDiP2WstagCJoC/w530-h297-rw/Hyde%2BNightclub%2BPink17%2B022017.gif" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>It was fantastic getting to interact with all who attended.
