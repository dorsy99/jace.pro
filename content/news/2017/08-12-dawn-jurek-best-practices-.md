<p>Did you know that the ServiceNow platform provides robust and easy-to-use reporting functions? Are you taking advantage of these features to get critical live data out to your managers, co-workers and project teams? In this installment of our <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/content?filterID=all~objecttype~objecttype%5Bblogpost%5D&amp;filterID=all~tag%5Bnowsupport+best+practices+series%5D&amp;query=nowsupport+best+practices" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">best practices series</a>, we look at best practices for creating and sharing reports.</p><pre __default_attr="info" __jive_macro_name="alert" alert="info" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_alert" data-renderedposition="61.97265625_7.98828125_1191_43"><p>Note that you must have the admin, report_admin, or itil role to create or modify reports.</p></pre><p>With the Jakarta release, we've enhanced the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/reference/report-types-creation-details.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/reference/report-types-creation-details.html">Report Designer</a> to make it even easier to create and share reports. Reports can be created from the <strong>Create New</strong> module under the <strong>Reports</strong> application, or directly from the dashboard. You can also create a report directly from a list by right-clicking on a column and selecting <strong>Bar Chart</strong> or <strong>Pie Chart</strong>.</p><p></p><h2>Choose clear and concise names for your reports</h2><p>You're probably creating reports with the intention to share the information with other groups and users, so be sure to choose clear and concise names to make it obvious to other users what data they can expect to see. Here are some examples:</p><p></p><dl><dt>Poor report name: <strong>2017 Incidents</strong></dt><dd style="padding-left: 30px;">This name is vague - it tells the user nothing about the incidents shown in the report, except that they occurred in 2017.</dd><dd style="padding-left: 30px;"></dd><dt>Better report name: <strong>Critical IT Incidents - January to June 2017</strong></dt><dd style="padding-left: 30px;">This name tells the user what type of incidents are in the report, the assignment group, and the timeframe.</dd></dl><p></p><h2>Create or use existing report sources as the source type for your reports</h2><p></p><p>When creating a report, you can use either a <strong>table</strong> or a <strong>data source</strong> as the <strong>Source type</strong>:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="reporting data source.png" class="image-9 jive-image" src="621d27f9db18dfc0b322f4621f96194c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 322px;"/></p><p></p><p>When using a <strong>table</strong>, you need to set the conditions for each report individually<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">—</span>even if the conditions are the same from one report to another.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="table_source_for_report_2.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7ea8a002db54dfc068c1fb651f96192c.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;">A better solution is to <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_ReportSources.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_ReportSources.html">create a report source</a><span style="color: #3d3d3d;"> (also called a <strong>data source</strong>; see note below) or use an existing one. A report source defines a standard set of conditions for querying a particular table, which can then be used in other reports.   An advantage to setting up report sources is that you can be sure users are always creating reports on the correct data set when they use a report source versus a table. As an additional benefit, you can edit a report source when a condition changes, and all the reports that use that source are updated as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><pre __default_attr="info" __jive_macro_name="alert" alert="info" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_alert" data-renderedposition="1182.91015625_7.98828125_1191_63"><p>In the <strong>Report Designer</strong> and <strong>Report Builder</strong>, <strong>report sources</strong> are called <strong>data sources</strong>.</p><p>You must have the <strong>report_admin</strong> or <strong>admin</strong> role to create a report source.</p></pre><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="data_source_for_report_2.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="d47908c2db509704ed6af3231f9619b5.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><h2>Enhance your reports with drilldowns and datasets</h2><p></p><p>In addition to using report sources, you can take advantage of <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_DrillingDownWithinReports.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_DrillingDownWithinReports.html">drilldowns</a> and <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_MultipleDataSets.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_MultipleDataSets.html">datasets</a> to further enhance your reports. While they may not be needed for every type of report, they allow you to provide multiple types of data in a report when applicable.</p><p></p><p><strong>Drilldowns</strong> add value to reports by providing additional visualizations, and they allow viewers to dive into sub-groups of data.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="reporting drilldown.png" class="image-10 jive-image" src="2ad19186db581b04ed6af3231f9619aa.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 328px;"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Datasets</strong> allow you to combine data from multiple tables in the same visualization. Here's an example of incident and problem data in one report:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="multiple data sets reporting.png" class="image-11 jive-image" src="0b303ccedb58dfc068c1fb651f9619a7.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 447px;"/></p><p></p><h2>Consider your audience when choosing the type of visualization for your reports</h2><p></p><p>When selecting the <strong>type</strong> of visualization (pie chart, bar graph, list view, etc.) for your report, choose the option that best communicates the data contained within the report. Oftentimes several different options could work equally well for presenting the information, so consider your audience and what they'll be using the data for when making this choice. We have 25+ types of reports for you to choose from. Here is a complete list and description of each to help you decide which one to use: <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/reference/report-types-creation-details.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/reference/report-types-creation-details.html">Report types and creation details</a></p><p></p><h2>Use the Configure and Style tab options</h2><p></p><p>The Configure and Style tabs allow you to further fine-tune your report visualizations. On the <strong>Configure</strong> tab, you select how the data is grouped. You also have the option to display table data.</p><p></p><p><span style="color: #3d3d3d;">The <strong>Additional group by</strong> option allows you to display multiple groupings in one report. The viewer can change the grouping displayed in the report via a menu. This option works great for widgets on dashboards.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="reporting configure tab.png" class="image-12 jive-image" src="18c3504edb141f048c8ef4621f96194e.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 327px;"/></p><p>On the <strong>Style</strong> tab, you can change the size, colors and other visual aspects of your report. Here, you can also choose to display data labels:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="reporting data labels.png" class="image-13 jive-image" src="39cd237ddbd893049c9ffb651f961964.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 367px;"/></p><p></p><h2>Choose the best method for sharing your report</h2><p></p><p>Once you've created a report and saved it, you need to choose a method for sharing it. Which option is best? That depends on how you want to use it. Here's the rundown on the <strong>Sharing</strong> options, starting with those considered best practice because the data is live, not static.</p><h2></h2><h3>Best sharing options</h3><ul><li><strong>Share </strong>— Allows you to share a report with different users and groups via the <strong>Report</strong> module, provided they've been given access to the data contained within the report.</li><li><strong>Add to Dashboard</strong> —<strong> </strong>Allows you to add the report to your dashboard where it can be displayed for easy viewing and access, without having to search for it.</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="reporting share options.png" class="image-14 jive-image" src="13b059cedb94130468c1fb651f9619d1.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 327px;"/></p><h3>Other sharing options</h3><ul><li><strong>Schedule</strong> — Allows you to run and share a snapshot of the report in PDF format at scheduled days and times.</li><li><strong>Export to PDF</strong> — Allows you to export a static copy of the report to print a hard copy, or to send as an email attachment. Keep in mind that this may be the least preferred method of sharing, as the data on this type of distributed report won't c<span style="color: #3d3d3d;">ontain live data, and could be outdated by the time the receiver views it.</span></li><li><span style="color: #3d3d3d;"><strong>Publish</strong> — <span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">C</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; background: white;">reates a URL that <strong>anyone</strong> can use to access the report, including people who are not users. When anyone navigates to the URL, the report is generated with current data from the instance; however, a user needs to be logged in to your instance to view individual records. </span>When you Unpublish a report, it breaks the link, making the report no longer visible to anyone accessing that URL.</span></li></ul><p></p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;">For more information, see:</p><ul><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_GenerateReports.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_GenerateReports.html">Getting started with reports</a></li><li><a title="TechBytes Episode 35: Reporting Tips and Tricks" __default_attr="6987" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="TechBytes Episode 35: Reporting Tips and Tricks" data-renderedposition="4413.28125_37.98828125_325_16" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=c28ce6e1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619d8">TechBytes Episode 35: Reporting Tips and Tricks</a></li><li><a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=IYnKE3E7qmg&list=PLCOmiTb5WX3oZW9-PaYGVojiEwVhQJdxi" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYnKE3E7qmg&amp;list=PLCOmiTb5WX3oZW9-PaYGVojiEwVhQJdxi">NowSupport YouTube playlist: Reporting</a></li></ul><p></p><p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #666666;">--</p><p></p><p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #666666;">Behind the scenes here at ServiceNow, the Knowledge Management and Multimedia teams work closely with subject matter experts to disseminate critical information to our customers.
