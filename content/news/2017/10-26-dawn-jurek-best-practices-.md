<p style="margin-left: .5in;"><em>Businesses suffer IT service disruptions every day — often resulting in lost revenue, reputation damage, and unhappy customers. To minimize the negative impact of these incidents, a combination of people, process, technology, and information is needed to help restore normal operations as quickly as possible.</em></p><p align="right" style="padding-left: 30px;">—<a title="ww.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/datasheets/ds-inc-prb-21030103.pdf" href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/datasheets/ds-inc-prb-21030103.pdf">ServiceNow Incident Management Data Sheet</a></p><p></p><p>ServiceNow <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-it-service-management/page/product/incident-management/concept/c_IncidentManagement.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-it-service-management/page/product/incident-management/concept/c_IncidentManagement.html" style="color: #954f72;">Incident Management</a> streamlines service restoration after an unplanned disruption. It aligns with the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework—the most widely accepted approach to IT service management. In this installment of our <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=6e7d6269dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619c0">NOWSupport best practices series</a>, you can learn more about incident management, including best practices for implementing a simple, industry standard approach to incident management in your organization.</p><p></p><p>First, check out this Incident Management Overview video on our <a title="ww.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo">NOWSupport YouTube channel</a>:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryxjWBOq3sQ?rel=0" width="640"> 
</iframe></p><p></p><p>Now, here's some best practices for implementing the Incident Management application in your organization:</p><p></p><h2>Use assignment rules to assign each incident to the correct support group</h2><p>The first step in handling an incident promptly is to make sure it's assigned to the appropriate group right away. An incident can be assigned to a support group based on contact type (for example, self-service, email, or call), category, location, configuration item (CI), and other conditions defined in assignment rules.</p><p></p><p>Identify the factors that should be used for incident assignment in your organization, and then use the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/task-table/concept/c_AssignmentRulesModule.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/task-table/concept/c_AssignmentRulesModule.html">Assignment rules module</a> to set up assignment rules. Here's an example of an assignment rule that assigns an incident to the Network group (specified on the <strong>Assign To</strong> tab) when the incident <strong>Category</strong> is <strong>Network</strong>:</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Incident Management-Network assignment rule.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="cdd3e0cadb50dfc068c1fb651f961904.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 341px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Link related incidents</h2><p>Starting with the Jakarta release, the <strong>Parent Incident</strong> field appears in the related forms section of the incident form, so that you can see which incidents have parent records.</p><p></p><p>A new plugin that provides alignment with proven ITIL practices was introduced in Jakarta: <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/administer/plugins/reference/r-jakarta-plugin-changes.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/administer/plugins/reference/r-jakarta-plugin-changes.html">Incident Management Best Practice</a>. This plugin in Jakarta (com.snc.best_practice.incident.jakarta)   is activated by default for new customers. Customers who upgrade from a previous release must request the plugin by <a title="ww.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.html">contacting Customer Support</a>.</p><p></p><pre __default_attr="info" __jive_macro_name="alert" alert="info" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_alert" data-renderedposition="1329.6875_7.997159004211426_1192_43"><p>See the Jakarta<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/incident-management-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/incident-management-rn.html">Incident Management release notes</a></span> for details on how this plugin updates the Incident form and functionality.</p></pre><p></p><p><img   alt="Incident Management-Child incident.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="995b88c2db1c1344e9737a9e0f961936.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 186px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>If you upgraded to Jakarta from an earlier release and chose not to request the plugin, you must configure the form layout to add the <strong>Parent Incident</strong> field to the Related Records section.</p><p></p><p>Using the parent-child functionality, an incident is designated as a parent incident and all other related incidents are linked to the parent using the Child Incidents related list. Work notes and comments updated on the parent incident are copied to the child incidents, which in turn keeps the stakeholders informed. When the parent incident is resolved, the child incidents are resolved and the resolution information is copied to the child incidents.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Incident Management-Parent incident.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="524f2bfddb189b048c8ef4621f96195f.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 253px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>If the Child Incidents related list doesn't appear on your incident form, you can add it by configuring the related lists to include Incident-&gt;Parent Incident.</p><p></p><h2>View related tasks</h2><p>While investigating and diagnosing incidents, support teams can find critical information by analyzing the following:</p><p></p><ul><li>Other incidents created for the same caller</li><li>Different tasks affecting the same configuration item and business service, for example, known errors and open change requests</li></ul><p></p><p>To identify related tasks, review these:</p><ul><li>Related incidents (click <img   alt="Incident Management-Show related incidents icon.png" class="image-4 jive-image" height="33" src="0f17d946dbd81b04ed6af3231f96196e.iix" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0px; width: 33px; height: 33px;" width="33"/> icon next to the <strong>Caller</strong> field)</li><li>Related Incidents list</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-it-operations-management/page/product/service-mapping/concept/c_UndestandMaps.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-it-operations-management/page/product/service-mapping/concept/c_UndestandMaps.html">Business service Maps</a></li><li>Other active tasks<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Cambria',serif;">—</span>click <img   alt="Incident Management-Other active tasks icon.png" class="image-6 jive-image" height="25" src="a55f6046db985f048c8ef4621f961941.iix" style="vertical-align: middle; height: 25px; width: 25.7143px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" width="25"/> in the business service map: <img   alt="Incident Management-Business service map.png" class="image-7 jive-image" height="71" src="d82f0cc6db105304b322f4621f961936.iix" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 0px; width: 106px; height: 70.4659px;" width="106"/></li></ul><h2>Use incident states</h2><p>Incidents should be tracked throughout their lifecycle to support proper handling and reporting.
