<p>A customer recently notified me that they were missing a lot of important updates to tickets.   The updates were expected to be delivered via an email integration.</p><p>Checking sys_email, I noticed a ton of new received-ignored messages with failure messages like this...<br/><img   class="jive-image" src="f6db7c42dbdcdfc068c1fb651f961965.iix"/><br/>The error string didn't provide any help, so I dug into the headers.   BAM!   All the failures had X-ServiceNow-Spam flags in the headers.   <img   class="image-1 jive-image" src="0ff0e54adbd8d304b322f4621f9619a3.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p>That's critical info because of this default sys_property:</p><p><img   class="jive-image" src="336b9486db585304b322f4621f9619ff.iix"/></p><p>What troubled me is why this suddenly became a problem.   I managed to find <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549426" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549426">KB0549426</a> which stated...<br/><span style="font-size: 10pt;">"<span style="color: #485563; font-family: SourceSansPro, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial;">Note that as of <span style="color: #e23d39; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>6/29/2017</strong></span>, SPF checks now factor more heavily into a mail's spam score.   In order to be flagged as spam, a message must have an aggregate score of 6.2 or higher.   A soft SPF failure will add 6.0 to the score, whereas a hard SPF failure will add 7.0 to the score (immediately flagging it as spam).   It is recommended to check and ensure that your company's SPF records are correct and up-to-date, or some messages may be inadvertently marked as spam."</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #485563; font-size: 10pt; font-family: SourceSansPro, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial;">So that explains why inbound email actions have been so unreliable for the past couple weeks.   I recommend everyone check their sys_email logs for anything with "received-ignored" state.   You could be in my customer's position with a *TON* of missing data.</span></p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #485563; font-size: 10pt; font-family: SourceSansPro, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial;">POSSIBLE RESOLULTIONS</span></h1><p>- So the KB article instructs you to "update the SPF records", but this is coming from another ServiceNow instance.   Does this mean all SN to SN mail integrations are now suspect?</p><p>- Remove X-ServiceNow-Spam-Flag:YES from the "Ignore mail with these headers" sys_property.</p>
