<p>When you look for information about how to use our products, you want to find the content that is most appropriate for the tasks you need to perform. You likely don't want to navigate to multiple sites to find the answer, right? The product documentation team at ServiceNow introduced a new landing page design for major product areas on docs.servicenow.com to help you find the answers you need faster.</p><p><img   alt="Discovery documentation landing page.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7743810edb9013043eb27a9e0f961936.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 211px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><h2>New product documentation landing pages</h2><p>You can find landing pages at the top level of a content area, for example Knowledge Management, Discovery, Customer Service, and many more content areas. The new landing pages are the jumping-off point for the most relevant information to get you up and running with the product.</p><p></p><p>We created categories to organize the information that is available for the product area, and to help you identify the content that best applies to your needs. For example, you'll find product overviews, key concepts, or release information under the <strong>Explore</strong> category, and information about initial activation, setup, and configuration under the <strong>Set up</strong> category. In the <strong>Administer</strong> category, you'll find information about ongoing maintenance or monitoring tasks an administrator performs, while the <strong>Use</strong> category focuses on tasks for the business user.</p><p></p><p>Under each category, we've included links to the most relevant content available â€” and not just in the <a title="cs.servicenow.com/" href="http://docs.servicenow.com/">product documentation</a>. You'll also find links to <a title="ww.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo">YouTube videos</a>, <a title="i.service-now.com/knowledge_home_launcher.do" href="https://hi.service-now.com/knowledge_home_launcher.do">Knowledge Base</a> articles, <a title="w.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification.html">training</a>, or <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/welcome">community</a> resources where it applies.</p><p></p><h3>Here are our most popular Product Documentation landing pages so far:</h3><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/other/r_ReportingLandingPage.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/other/r_ReportingLandingPage.html">Reporting</a></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/topic/p_KnowledgeManagment.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/topic/p_KnowledgeManagment.html">Knowledge Management</a></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-operations-management/page/product/discovery/reference/r-discovery.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-operations-management/page/product/discovery/reference/r-discovery.html">Discovery</a></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/performance-analytics/reference/r_PALandingPage.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/performance-analytics/reference/r_PALandingPage.html">Performance Analytics</a></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/dashboards/other/r_DashboardsLandingPage.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/dashboards/other/r_DashboardsLandingPage.html">Dashboards</a></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-service-management-for-the-enterprise/page/product/customer-service-management/concept/c_CustomerServiceManagement.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-service-management-for-the-enterprise/page/product/customer-service-management/concept/c_CustomerServiceManagement.html">Customer Service Management</a></li></ul><p></p><p>We've introduced over 20 of the new landing pages and have more on the way.
