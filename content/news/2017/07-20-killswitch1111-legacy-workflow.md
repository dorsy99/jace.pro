<p>Many people still like to utilize the out of box REST Message workflow activity when creating their workflows.   This activity has been deemed "deprecated" by the platform, and thus has not been updated. I ran into an issue (again) utilizing the Rest Message Activity with a Rest Message record this morning, and have noticed that this particular issue/workaround does not seem to be documented on the community as of yet.</p><p></p><p>The issue is this:</p><p></p><p>When you create a new Rest Message record (sys_rest_message) the platform used to create four functions (or resources) for you: get, put, post, and delete.   These function names directly related to the http method being used in the underlying RESTMessage script include.   The issue comes in that newer versions of the platform have updated this to have a second field on the HTTP Method (sys_rest_message_fn or Rest Message Function) table to explicitly choose the HTTP Method from a drop down.   This new functionality is utilized by the orchestration engine and newer Rest Message Activity Designer workflow activities that are shipped as a part of the Orchestration Engine.   Also, instead of creating all four Rest Functions (HTTP Methods) we only create one, with the name of "Default GET."   This is nice to show what something should look like when using the newer Activity Designer, but ends up causing havoc if you are trying to utilize the older Rest Message Activity.   If you use a Rest Message Activity with one of the Functions (HTTP Methods) that does NOT have a name of get, put, post, or delete, the workflow activity will throw an error of: TypeError: Cannot convert null to an object.</p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-19 at 9.00.37 AM.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="24edd40adb1c1f048c8ef4621f96191d.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 440px;"/></p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-19 at 9.00.55 AM.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="1231c946db1897041dcaf3231f9619d8.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 446px;"/></p><p></p><p>The simplest fix for this is to ensure that you change the name of the HTTP Method to one of the supported http methods, get, put, post or delete.   I will be also following this up with an update set that can fix this as well at a lower layer.</p><p></p><p>From this (when first created):</p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-19 at 9.36.24 AM.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="e480c4c2db941304b322f4621f9619d1.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 284px;"/></p><p>To this:</p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-19 at 9.36.34 AM.png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="75f62dc6db5cd304b322f4621f96192c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 288px;"/></p>
