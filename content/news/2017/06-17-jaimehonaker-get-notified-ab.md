<p>The ServiceNow Knowledge Base is a tool we use to house information and solutions to product issues in one location. There are two types of content you can search for: a standard Knowledge Base article and a Known Error article.</p><p></p><p>A standard Knowledge Base article is where you find information on resources, best practices, or customer support information. Known Error articles are created when customer-facing errors are found in ServiceNow products that might result in incidents. These articles are compiled into a database repository that makes them searchable and consumable based on the specified audience.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to Known Error articles, you don't have to wonder or wait to find out when one has been updated. Did you know you can subscribe to a Known Error article to receive notifications when updates are made?</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="bill nye.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="17c92335db1893049c9ffb651f961930.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><h1 style="text-align: left;">Why subscribe to a Known Error article?</h1><p>In order to stay current on the progress being made on a Known Error, you have the option to sign up for updates. When you subscribe to an article, we will notify you and send you updates whenever the article (or associated PRB) is updated with new information. What does this mean? You no longer have to open an Incident to get these updates!</p><p></p><p>Examples of when subscribing to a known error article might be helpful:</p><ul><li>You logged an incident with ServiceNow, the incident was classified as a product defect, a problem record was created, and an associated known error article was created, so you want to know the latest information and workarounds available</li><li>You received an email message from ServiceNow about a specific issue and the message contained a link to a known error article that will be updated as new information becomes available</li></ul><p></p><h2>How to receive notifications when a Known Error article has been updated</h2><p>To subscribe to a Known Error article:</p><ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Open HI at <span style="color: windowtext;"><a title=".service-now.com/" href="http://hi.service-now.com/" target="_blank">hi.service-now.com</a></span>.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Self-Service &gt; Knowledge</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Known Error Database</strong>.</li><li>Search for the known error article relevant to your issue.</li><li>Open the article.</li><li>Click the <strong>Subscribe </strong>button on the top right-hand side of the article.</li></ol><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="" class="jive-image" data-original-title="" hspace="" src="https://hi.service-now.com/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=0fec156f6f80c64056fb8e4c2c3ee467" style="color: #485563; font-family: SourceSansPro, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;" title="" vspace=""/></p><p>You can unsubscribe at any time by opening the known error article and clicking <strong>Unsubscribe</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, at this time, you are only able to subscribe to Known Error articles and not standard Knowledge Base articles.</p><p></p><p>By subscribing to Known Error articles, you'll be the first to know when an update has been made so you can address any issues you're experiencing as quickly as possible. This could include: when a workaround is updated, when a new fix is available, or when a problem state changes.</p><p></p><p>For more information on ServiceNow Known Errors, see <a title="britt.champeau" __default_attr="23178" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="britt.champeau" data-renderedposition="1429.96875_360.078125_114_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=c060d269db581fc09c9ffb651f961941">britt.champeau</a>'s blog post on <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=5ffca6a5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961983">Updates to ServiceNow Known Errors </a>or check out the KB article on <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549746" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549746">Subscribing to known error articles (KB0549746)</a>.</p>
