<p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The most common enhancement request I've received related to the Standard Change Catalog feature has requested a way to confirm the standard change template being requested prior to creating the change request record. Quite a few of you have relayed your users are selecting the wrong standard change template forcing the change management team to clean up invalid or orphaned records. As our greatest product stakeholders, we heard you and have responded. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Before we talk about Jakarta, let's refresh our memory of the current standard change catalog request behavior in Geneva, Helsinki, and Istanbul. Historically, when a standard change proposal is approved, a standard change template is exposed in the catalog. When a published template is requested, it instantly creates a corresponding change request without giving you the opportunity to catch yourself:   "No, that's not the one I wanted!"</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Jakarta introduces a new property called Two step which is now the second property listed in the Standard Change Properties module. For new instances provisioned on Jakarta the property will be true, by default. For customers upgrading to Jakarta, you will need to enable the property by clicking the check box as shown here:</span></p><p></p><p><img  alt="Standard Change Two Step.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="d0150cc2db581304b322f4621f96192b.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">When Two step is enabled, selecting a standard change template from the catalog will now re-direct you to the change request form. The template will populate the change request record with the appropriate template information as it always has, but the record will not be created until the user submits the record. To ensure your users recognize this, we've placed a helpful information alert in the header informing them of the need to click submit to commit the record.   </span></p><p></p><p><img  alt="Standard Change Request Two Step .png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="3fbf1b75db901fc03eb27a9e0f9619aa.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 412px;"/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Once the record is submitted, you're on your way. Now, get rolling and fulfill those low risk, pre-authorized standard change requests.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">The new Two step standard change process is available in Jakarta and it's all because of you.
