<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The Now Platform<sup>TM</sup> has some exciting new features in the Jakarta release to help you build business apps at lightspeed. We'd like to highlight three new products coming in this release that will help you increase productivity and improve user experience of your business apps.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #0070c0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Introducing MetricBase<sup><br/></sup></strong></span></p><p><img   alt="Predictive Intelligence.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="c70ad5cadb5c97049c9ffb651f9619fa.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 546px;"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">At Knowledge this year, we introduced the new name for the ServiceNow Platform, the Now Platform<sup>TM</sup>.   We're excited to announce<span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong> MetricBase </strong></span>as part of the Jakarta release, a new key capability of the platform   and part of the Intelligent Automation Engine that we announce during <a title="nowledge.servicenow.com/video-library.html?tab=busapp" href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/video-library.html?tab=busapp">Knowledge</a> to help you drive your business faster with better information and accelerated decisions and actions. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Organizations are challenged with an enormous volume of data metrics being collected continuously across an exploding number of internet devices. This creates huge volumes of time series data<sup>1</sup>. Traditional relational databases and instance-based storage cannot accommodate the scale, performance and high availability requirements for storing, aggregating and analyzing data points obtained sequentially at successive points in time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">MetricBase allows ServiceNow customers to collect, retain, analyze, and visualize measurable data from any source or combination of sources on the Now Platform. It consumes vast volumes of time series data and enables organizations to accelerate business decisions and actions with both historical perspective and predictive analytics. </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">MetricBase provides multiple policy-based storage frequency and retention options in a separate database accessed from your ServiceNow instance. High capacity throughput can achieve capture rates of up to 160k values per second or 14 billion data points per day.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Once captured, you can compare metrics over time by being able to chart and analyze the history of any measurable data while searching for events, trends, timelines, or other metrics across combined data sources using real time queries. APIs can also enable applications to insert and retain time series data. You can take immediate action on trends you identify and even automate specific actions based on static thresholds and triggers. Create near real-time dashboards and reports to monitor abnormal behavior and trends over a defined period of time. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">MetricBase requires separate provisioning and is for-charge. Please contact your account team for more information.   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #0070c0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Guided Tour Designer</strong></span></p><p><strong> <img   alt="GTD.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="b4493002db1097049c9ffb651f9619b9.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 281px;"/></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When you implement a new form, report, or app, it takes time for users to learn how to use it. Support requests can inundate IT and productivity is slowed while users spend time getting up to speed.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Guided Tour Designer eases the pain of learning how to use new forms, reports, and apps with integrated self-guidance that can be customized for specific roles. Create page-based tours with easy tour playback to educate users and onboard them faster. Prescriptive guidance gives users step-by-step instructions as they use the new form, report, or app for efficient, real-time help. Users can spend more time working on things that matter and less time submitting support inquiries.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #0070c0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Instance Security Dashboard</strong></span></p><p><strong> <img   alt="Instance Security Dashboard.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="15961006db989704ed6af3231f961945.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 246px;"/></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Decentralized security audit information makes it difficult for ServiceNow Admins to determine what remediation steps are needed. It takes time to figure out what is most effective and in that time, the instance is vulnerable to security risks. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The Instance Security Dashboard offers admins a quick, single view of the compliance levels of 11 security audit areas listed in the <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550654" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550654">Instance Hardening Guide</a> (HI credentials are required). A single compliance score makes it easy to understand the current status of an instance and allows for easy identification of security deficiencies. Guided recommendations for remediation steps help admins quickly mitigate application security risks.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #0070c0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Learn More</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Want to know more about this release?
