<p>I just stumbled over a new Security restraint that I never noticed before. I had a user that had the role "user_admin" so they could do some standard admin stuff. <br/>Now with the role, you have the "groups" module and in that, you can press "new". Here you put in your data and press save, unless you want to add a type.</p><p></p><p>Then this happens…<br/><img  alt="ACL 1.JPG" class="image-1 jive-image" height="316" src="aee10486db98d3049c9ffb651f961932.iix" style="width: 604px; height: 315.639px;" width="604"/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>That was kind of a bummer. But my guess was some kind of ACL so I put on my superhero cape and started to debug security.</p><p>I was expecting a page with at least ONE red row with ACL to confirm that I was right on track, but this is what I got.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="acl 2 all green.JPG" class="image-2 jive-image" height="327" src="79a4290edb90df048c8ef4621f9619ad.iix" style="width: 564px; height: 326.574px;" width="564"/></p><p></p><p>I see the "Security constrains prevent access to requested page". However, it is all green and after another look.</p><p>I can see that there is not any ACL at all. This should be your "red flag".</p><p>I remember the days when I took the sys admin course, going through ACL for the first time and it was VERY complex, and I never thought I would understand it.</p><p>Nevertheless, I got that if it could not find an ACL for the specific table, it go downwards to the wildcard one etc.</p><p></p><p>And I have this beautiful picture in my head =)</p><p></p><p><img  alt="Acl_matching.png" class="image-3 jive-image" height="569" src="f7ce30c2db909f048c8ef4621f96192a.iix" style="width: 448px; height: 569.187px;" width="448"/></p><p></p><p>Now, there is a * ACL, but it requires me to have the role admin to get access. But I do not see any red rows in my debug…</p><p>It all boils down to the Security settings. Default it has this setting under system properties-&gt; Security</p><p><img  alt="ACL 2.JPG" class="image-4 jive-image" src="4cb0e84adbdc9fc068c1fb651f961952.iix" style="width: auto; height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Meaning that if it doesn't have any ACL at all, it will be deny...<br/>and it didn't have any.<br/><img  class="image-5 jive-image" height="136" src="c7810c86db98d3041dcaf3231f9619ae.iix" style="width: 484px; height: 135.832px;" width="484"/></p><p></p><p>So to fix this, I created a ACL and put in the role I wanted to be able to get access to the type.</p><p>And here you can see with the ACL Execution plan that it adds it just like we want =)</p><p><img  class="image-6 jive-image" height="293" src="04f561c2db5cd304b322f4621f961916.iix" style="width: 497px; height: 292.589px;" width="497"/></p><p></p><p></p><p>And when the user now goes in and clicks on type, it shows up.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="ACL works.JPG" class="image-7 jive-image" height="309" src="5360490edb10130468c1fb651f961902.iix" style="height: 309px; width: 496.993px;" width="497"/></p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope this will help in the daily ACL work that we all love <span __jive_emoticon_name="happy" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="2866_367_16_16" src="/8.0.4.21bdc7e/images/emoticons/happy.png"></span></p><p></p><p>//Göran</p><p></p><p><img  alt="sn-community-mvp.png" class="image-8 jive-image" height="61" src="63ed94cedbdc17049c9ffb651f961993.iix" style="width: 171px; height: 60.8px;" width="171"/><img  alt="Symfoni Logo Color Box.jpg" class="image-9 jive-image" height="64" src="e2a4e54adb50d7049c9ffb651f96191d.iix" style="width: 220px; height: 64.2258px;" width="220"/></p>
