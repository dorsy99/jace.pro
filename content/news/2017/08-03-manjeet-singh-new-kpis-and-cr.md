<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"How are we doing?" or "How can I perform better" are common questions company leadership asks their IT professionals. Do the IT professionals in your organization have the right metrics to have a good conversation? Or is "We'll get back to you" the standard response?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">For organizations looking for a good peer comparison and baseline, the traditional benchmark reports cost thousands of dollars. The accuracy of such reports is questionable because data collected via manually filled surveys can be quite subjective. These benchmark reports fail to provide on-going, real-time trends and comparisons which mean that businesses need to pay consultants to implement and interpret these tools and reports. Overall, this is an expensive undertaking with unsatisfactory results.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We made the first version of Benchmarks available to ServiceNow customers during Istanbul release time frame back in October 2016. Since then, we have received an overwhelming amount of feedback from customers asking for more KPIs, more features, and flexibility to change KPI definitions to align their customized service implementation. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The wait is over now. In the Jakarta release, we have brought real time <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-it-service-management/page/product/benchmarks/reference/r_Benchmarks.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-it-service-management/page/product/benchmarks/reference/r_Benchmarks.html">Benchmarks</a> functionality into Instance. The Benchmarks App is available out of the box for ITSM and ITOM customers.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h1>4 business changing benefits of Benchmarks in Jakarta</h1><p></p><p></p><ol><li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>New KPIs: Here is the list of KPIs available in Jakarta release.
