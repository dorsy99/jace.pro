<p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">Recently I met up with a good friend (and fellow software industry person) for coffee to catch up.   After settling in and placing our orders she put her hands down on the table and with great excitement said she had something to share with me.   She was almost bursting with anticipation to share this news so I wondered what it was... a promotion at work?   a shoe sale at Bloomingdales?   When I asked what this exciting news was she said:   an app... about home insurance (queue the screech of a record player).   Home insurance?   What is so exciting about home insurance?   What I soon learned is it wasn't the product itself she was enthusiastic about, but the experience she had when obtaining a quote.   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">The company is a start up, Lemonade, that's taking market share from the traditional brick and mortar insurance companies - they do not have brokers or overhead and are able to quote individuals renters or home insurance after asking a series of questions - all based on their app and artificial intelligence engine.   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">Curious I downloaded the app and started conversing with "Maya", my Personal Insurance Assistant.</span></p><p></p><p><img   alt="image1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="432" src="8a55080adbd41344e9737a9e0f96194d.iix" style="width: 243px; height: 432px;" width="243"/><img   alt="image2.png" class="image-2 jive-image" height="429" src="89f26735db9c9f04e9737a9e0f961908.iix" style="width: 241px; height: 428.747px;" width="241"/><img   alt="image3.png" class="image-3 jive-image" height="430" src="d66c0542db9413043eb27a9e0f9619cf.iix" style="width: 242px; height: 429.906px;" width="242"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">Now, I didn't need home insurance but the experience was a little fun I must say, and I had a quote in less than 5 minutes.   <em>Go ahead and try Lemonade just for giggles.</em></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">Take this type of experience and apply it other service providers - like HR.     Imagine employees bubbling about the experience they had asking about Maternity Leave and then telling 10 of their colleagues.   What a great way to build HR's brand!</span></p>
