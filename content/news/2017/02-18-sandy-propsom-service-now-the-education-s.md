<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to teach our first Service Portal class. Karen Lazarenko did an amazing job creating this class! Just to give you a little background, this course was originally developed by Karen and Pamela Olomola for Knowledge 16. Sean McClean, Karen, Pamela, and I had the opportunity to teach it to two sold out rooms! Because of the great demand and success at K16 we are pleased to now offer it as a class anyone can take.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Here is a little more information about the class in case you are interested in taking it…</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">and enroll here... <a href="https://servicenow.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA1PRD0015/common/ledetail/ES-SN-PORTAL" title="https://servicenow.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA1PRD0015/common/ledetail/ES-SN-PORTAL">Saba</a> </span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="Picture1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="a67224c2db90d704ed6af3231f961938.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 344px;"/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A Service Portal quickly and easily creates requests, provides access to Knowledge and searchable information, and provides an effective, friendly way to complete tasks. The ServiceNow Service Portal application provides the features to design a Service Portal, and many of the ServiceNow applications are accompanied with customizable Service Portals.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Create new Service Portals, Themes, Pages, and Menus</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Understand how to create and use Widgets</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Reâ€‘use existing Portal components</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Navigate all aspects of the Service Portal application</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Configure other aspects of the platform to enhance a Service Portal </span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Participants achieve these objectives through the combination of labs, demos, lecture, group discussions, and instructorâ€‘facilitated interactive discussions (Tech Talks).
