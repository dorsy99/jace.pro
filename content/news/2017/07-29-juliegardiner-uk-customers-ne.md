<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">The HR Customer Success team hosted 13 individuals from 9 customers for an intimate event in London last week in the ServiceNow office. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">Customers were provided an opportunity to network with other HR professionals in their area, hear from the HR BU on its strategy and product roadmap, see a demo of Jakarta as well as get a sneak peak of Kingston themes. Participation in the HR Community, as well as the UK local SNUG was also highlighted and encouraged.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">Feedback from the group was that the afternoon was one of the more valuable meetings that they had participated in.   They appreciated the ability to dive into HR-specific topics, gather best practices from other customers using HRSD, and see what's coming in future HRSD deliverables.   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Interested in attending or hosting an HR Community event?
