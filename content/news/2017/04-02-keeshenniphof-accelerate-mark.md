I wrote about the first stage implementation <a title="eeshenniphof.com/2015/01/11/awesome-we-built-a-marketing-activity-planning-app-on-servicenow/" href="https://keeshenniphof.com/2015/01/11/awesome-we-built-a-marketing-activity-planning-app-on-servicenow/">here</a>. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Since, the app was further developed to include more functionality around budget allocation, procurement, approval and workflows, and reporting, and continued to permeate the ServiceNow Field Marketing organisation globally. Today, all geographies plan in MAPapp, which allows us to pivot and visualize our investments against business units, target audiences, activity types and projected contribution to sales pipeline.</span></p><p></p><h2><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Project Portfolio Planning for Marketing</span></h2><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Over the last 2 years, we've invested heavily in building out the Project Portfolio Management capability of the ServiceNow Platform. Today, we are confident we can compete with best of breed PMO software suites. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Hence, after activity planning and budgeting, we can now start using the out of the box Project Portfolio Management module in the ServiceNow platform for Marketing Management. By adopting a single system of record and common way of working across our marketing department, we expect to get even more done with the available resources. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">In April, the team will be trained on the inner workings of the ServiceNow PPM module (thank you, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=bda1126ddb981fc09c9ffb651f9619d3">Faez Ahmed</a> &amp; team!).</span></p><p></p><p></p><h2>General workflow for Marketing Activity Planning and Action</h2><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The general workflow will follow these steps:</span><br/><br/></p><ol><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">A planned Marketing Activity is created in MAPapp and submitted for approval.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Management approves the activity and investment.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Upon approval, and from within MAPapp, the Marketing Manager triggers the Purchase Request Orders for the vendors listed in the MAPapp record, against the planned budgets. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The Purchase Requisition workflow automatically runs through our Procurement and Legal departments and eventually puts out the Purchase Order which are needed to commence the work.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Depending on the type of activity, the Marketing Manager initiates the work in the Product Portfolio Management suite and manages it there until completion. Since we have onboarded our main contacts within our strategic vendors as employees, we can include them into our workflows, projects, visual taskboards, connect chats and notification emails. They are part of the marketing team.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Once the work is done and signed off, the goods are formally received within the system, the vendors send their invoices, which are being approved and processed for payment following the standard Invoicing workflow, and actual costs are transferred back into the initial MAPapp record for post-activity "planned vs actual" cost analyses.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Within PPM, the costs are being reported as part of the Project Portfolio financial analyses.</span></li></ol><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">This attempt at changing the way marketing works is just underway. It already spawned a host of questions and suggestions. I'll share some of them here, hoping to get some feedback from the Agile Marketing and PMO communities out there â€” both within ServiceNow and beyond. </span></p><p></p><p></p><h1>QUESTION #1</h1><h2>Are there customers or partners out there who use ServiceNow PPM for Marketing? Send me a note, as I want to host and moderate a community conversation on this topic at some point.</h2><p></p><p></p><h2>Managing the Work of Marketing on ServiceNow</h2><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">So how do we manage the work of marketing? Let's take a look at a classic demand generation setup and see how far we get in describing it from a PMO point of view.</span></p><p><img   alt="PPM4MKT_ServiceNow.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="406" src="7674e48adb9c5344e9737a9e0f961977.iix" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18.6666660308838px; line-height: 31.1111125946045px; height: 406px; width: 723.333333333333px;" width="723"/></p><h2></h2><h2><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Some observations</span></h2><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The smallest entity within the ServiceNow PPM module is the TASK, which designates the smallest unit of work. We have to think about what the smallest unit of work in marketing would be, in order to plan and manage the work at the right level of granularity.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">A classic way of structuring Enterprise Demand Generation breaks the work down into 6 main buckets: Programs (or: Initiatives), Campaigns, Projects, Programs, and Activities.</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">An "Initiative" (1) is mid- to long-term set of strategic programs, with a runtime of 3-5 years.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">A "Program" (2) is part of an "Initiative" and consists of a number of "Campaigns". </span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">A "Campaign" (3) is part of a "Program" and typically runs 6 to 12 months and is concerted sequence of integrated tactics or "Activities" under a common theme, like tradeshows, content marketing, Online content syndication and Inbound marketing, webinars, seminars, workshops, telemarketing et cetera. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">"Program" is in here twice, because we usually apply the term to both a number of related campaigns or projects, as well as for (4) a number of similar activities, like "the Webinar program" or "the Telemarketing program", with an assigned specialist manager overseeing all webinars or the entire Telemarketing investment for the GEO.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The term "Activity" (5) are part of a "Campaign" and refers to a single activity, like a webinar, a seminar, a call blitz day et cetera. We usually tick off a to do list to get activities done from head to tail. Our "Activities" and the funds they take are currently planned in MAPapp, but executed using email and spreadsheets, so outside of the ServiceNow platform.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">"Project" (6) is not in the illustration, because it falls outside of the running business of demand generation planning and execution. We usually refer to a "Project" when we are investing to innovate; when we create and pilot a new campaign or a new tactic, develop a new type of content asset, test a new scoring model in marketing automation. If successful, the output of such projects is then further developed and eventually integrated in the running business of planning and executing generic campaigns and activities. The development of MAPapp is another great example of a "Project". </span></li></ul><p></p><h2><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Mapping Marketing to PPM</span></h2><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Mapped to the structure provided in the ServiceNow Project Portfolio Management module, I expect the following management model to come out of our PPM training:</span></p><p></p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;"><li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Initiative.</strong> Owner: Global Go To Market Manager.

Our goal is to accelerate, not to slow the team down by forcing more admin on them. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The fact that the ServiceNow platform supports different PMO management models (Portfolio Management, waterfall planning, agile scrum planning) enables us to find the right system for Marketing at each level of planning and execution.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Look out for an update on this topic in about 2 months' time. Meanwhile, I'd appreciate any feedback and thoughts that could help me get this thing moving and done more effectively.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h1>QUESTION #2</h1><h2><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Given the setup of a classic Enterprise Demand Generation function and the way ServiceNow structures Project Portfolio Management; what is the best approach to Managing Demand Generation on the ServiceNow Platform?</span></h2>
