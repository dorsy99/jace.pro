<p>For several years enterprises have worked to implement IT Service Management to improve the delivery of IT services.   This journey to implementing common business processes on a common platform like ServiceNow for many customers have driven business value by improving service quality and consistency.   In addition, it has allowed enterprises to scale-out key services provided to their requestors by allowing them to standardize and automate solutions for common business processes.</p><p>So what drives enterprises from incremental business value to receiving transformational business value from Service Management?   Are the core capabilities that IT Service Management has been built on for years applicable to other departments like Finance and HR?</p><p></p><p>The quick answer to these questions is that the core capabilities that IT Service Management has been built on for years are the same core capabilities that departments outside of IT need as part of their Service Management strategy.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="Picture3.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="c14dc586db189f048c8ef4621f96193e.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 298px;"/></p><p>     </p><p>In the end, most departments are providers of a service that fulfill requests from requestors. Whether it is the HR process of on-boarding employees, IT process of provisioning employees laptops or the Facilities process of allocating office space, all departments have a service they provide and can benefit from the capabilities of service management for the enterprise.   Furthermore, the real business value that service management drives is when these departmental business processes become single enterprise process so that a single request from a requestor triggers standard business processes across departments on a single platform for maximum efficiency and delivery.</p><p></p><p>When multiple departments execute work on a single enterprise service management platform, the maximum amount of business value is returned to the business.   The real business value that service management drives is the ability for an enterprise to move from departmental or team delivery of services to enterprise delivery of services.   This provides the most productivity gains when it comes to providing service management across the enterprise.   In addition to productivity gains, enterprise service management drives the growth of a business by facilitating innovation or expansion into new markets. Finally, enterprise service management drives business value by providing risk management to the business.</p><p>In the end the business value that service management drives is only limited by the imagination of the enterprise.   On a single platform that facilitates the core capabilities of service management an enterprise can drive a lot of business value very quickly.</p>
