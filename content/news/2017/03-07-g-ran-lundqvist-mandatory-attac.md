<p>I've seen a lot of questions on the community where people would like to for example set a specific number of attachments as mandatory before the end user can submit the order.</p><p></p><p>Of course this can be done in more than one way, but here I'm showing a way where you as a sys admin or developer can leave the future configuration to the catalog admins. You don't need to do anything if they want to change the amount of attachment on an item or remove it. They can do it them self.</p><p></p><p>I basically just do 2 things:</p><p></p><p>1. Add a new field to the sc_cat_item table to handle the amount of attachment the limit should be.</p><p>2. I copy the widget SC Catalog Item and modify it to handle this functionality when the user submits.</p><p></p><p>So here is the video and I'm sorry about the quality, but I thought it was going to record in HD, but after I don't have time to record a new 30 min video <span __jive_emoticon_name="sad" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="218_957.953125_16_16" src="/8.0.4.21bdc7e/images/emoticons/sad.png"></span> But if there is anything you wonder about, just let me know.</p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/RRQUpYrlFnE" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p>Take care,</p><p></p><p>//GÃ¶ran</p><p></p><p><img  alt="sn-community-mvp.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="d015f375db9cdfc0b322f4621f9619e4.iix" style="width: auto; height: auto;"/><img  alt="Symfoni Logo Color Box.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="55" src="41261c42db145344e9737a9e0f96195b.iix" style="width: 189px; height: 55.2462px;" width="189"/></p>
