<p>Happy New Year to everyone! I know I said in the last <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/blog/2016/12/19/monday-musings-on-customer-service-december-19-2016">Monday Musings on Customer Service</a> I would not be back until January 9th. I also recognize today is Tuesday, not Monday. This morning, however, I came across an interesting article on <a title="br.org/2017/01/kick-ass-customer-service" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/kick-ass-customer-service">HBR.org</a> (see graphic from the article below) and felt compelled to write an entry today.</p><p></p><p>I like how the researchers organized their agent types into a single representative personality trait and the benefits (and costs) of each type. It took me back to an earlier time in my career, when I was managing technical support for a consumer software company. While not quite like HBR's personality-based approach, we had similarly identified a few key traits we looked for in people.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Solvers but not necessarily Technologists</span></h1><p>Because the technical support we were providing involved solving technical failings in software, you would think hiring the most knowledgeable candidates would have been our priority. Unfortunately, what was too often the case, was that the most technically skilled candidates often lacked the soft skills necessary - not only in working with customers, but even with colleagues.</p><p></p><p>After realizing our error with a series of bad hires, we changed our interview tactics and reset the bar. Rather than only interviewing candidates with technically-oriented resumes, we invited anyone with any type of service background in for an interview. Instead of asking questions related to solving common computer and software issues, instead we used a disabled car scenario: "You are driving down the road and your engine stops running. You pull over. Now what do you do?" The candidates whose first response was to call for assistance did not make the cut. Those that asked questions, such as "Do I have gas in the car?" or "Does it make any sounds when I try start it?" and similar inquiries were the applicants we were interested in. </p><p></p><p>How did we make up for the lack of technical knowledge? We ensured our baseline computer hardware, operating system, and company software training were sufficient to address our most common case types. After the initial training, agents went through technical training periodically as events like new software or operating systems were released and new common cases emerged.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Efficient</span></h1><p>Like The Controller from the HBR article, we looked for prospective technical support agents who would take charge of the situation. We prescribed a consistent approach customer issues: to "Acknowledge, Apologize, Act" (see prior <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/blog/2016/12/12/monday-musings-on-customer-service-december-12-2016">Musings</a>). While candidates weren't aware of this during the hiring process, we did test their ability to keep an interaction on track. When performing a mock call during the interview, did they see us taking the call off-course into unnecessary territory? How did they respond if we tried to introduce another issue while the first was still unresolved? Managing the call from start to end was critical to providing efficient service to the customer - after all, not only were we interested in keeping agents as productive as possible, but customers also appreciated fast solutions.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Defusers</span></h1><p>I saved the best and most important for last.</p><p></p><p>How well did the person I was considering to hire address the stress of an upset customer? Did they perform actions similar to the Acknowledging and Apologizing we expected of employees? If those initial actions they took did not change the trajectory of the call, what additional steps did they take? Yes, we tested candidates with one or more upset caller scenarios to determine how they would attempt to turn the call around without hanging up (yes, a few chose that route...) or elevating their own tone. Most applicants realized what we were doing and recognized they best not lose their cool; the follow-up to this mock call scenario was always a conversation Â  regarding how it might be possible more of their calls would be of this type - starting with an irate customer. How did they feel they could adapt to these calls, not carry emotions over into other calls, and ultimately feel at the end of the day?</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Your Ideal Agent</span></h1><p>While there were other characteristics we probed our candidates for, these were the most important to us at that time. We found if applicants scored better than average across these traits, they would very likely be successful in our environment. Considering what I shared and what the HBR article identifies, what do you look for in potential hires? Do you look at individual traits or have you identified distinct personality types?</p><p></p><p>Here's to wishing you a prosperous new year in customer service!</p><p></p><p><img  alt="HBR - rep types.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="538" src="9417a88edbd0dfc068c1fb651f9619e1.iix" style="width: 450px; height: 537.8225806451613px;" width="450"/></p>
