<p>The Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit in London has a bit of content overlap with its American cousin held this past June in Washington, D.C., including several of the same themes and some repeat sessions (meaning my <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=f98d6669dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619cd">previous posts</a> are still relevant). One big difference, however, is a focus on GDPR, the European General Data Protection Regulation. This regulation will start being enforced next May, but surveys presented at the summit indicate many organizations aren't yet prepared.</p><p></p><p>This regulation reaches far beyond Europe. Any organization that offers goods or services to the EU is affected--that means if you have employees, customers, partners, leads, and so forth in the EU, you will need to comply. GDPR covers individuals' rights to access and control their personal data. It also includes reporting requirements in the event personal data is breached.</p><p></p><p>There's a 72 hour notification window in the event a breach is discovered. This is meant to encourage communication and transparency. You've probably had information exposed as part of a data breach that actually occurred a year or more before you found out about it. Given that the average time to detect a data breach (according to the Ponemon Institute) is 191 days, you're still possibly looking at being notified 194 days after the breach actually happened, but it's definitely a shorter window than in some past breaches. Of course, that also means organizations need a good handle on what data they have and where it's stored to be able to know what may have been compromised in the event of a breach.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="FullSizeRender.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="2a76adcadb1053043eb27a9e0f961918.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 253px;"/></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><em>London's Canary Wharf as viewed from the Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit. <br/> Plenty of big names here who will need to comply with GDPR.</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>In his GDPR session, Bart Willemsen, a Gartner analyst focused on privacy, advised a deliberate approach to what data you collect and retain instead of collecting everything and keeping it forever "just in case." That's data minimization plus a considered data retention policy. In addition, that data retention policy needs to also apply to backups and third parties, as the data you don't have can't be breached (and you could be held responsible even if it were a third party that was breached).</p><p></p><p>Data privacy is a continuous process that also includes privacy impact and risk assessment, so you can see how GDPR is a hot topic for my Governance, Risk, and Compliance colleagues.</p><p></p><p>For further reading on GDPR, I recommend <strong><a title="ww.linkedin.com/pulse/gdpr-general-data-protection-regulation-quick-facts-best-manoj-patel/" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gdpr-general-data-protection-regulation-quick-facts-best-manoj-patel/">GDPR Quick Facts &amp; Best Practices</a></strong> and <strong><a title="ervicematters.servicenow.com/2017/04/11/gdpr-building-platform-data-breach/" href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2017/04/11/gdpr-building-platform-data-breach/">GDPR: Building a Platform Over The Data Breach</a></strong>. And if you're in London, we're hosting a <a title="fo.servicenow.com/Security-EN" href="http://info.servicenow.com/Security-EN">seminar</a> on how ServiceNow can help your compliance journey to GDPR in our Cheapside office this Wednesday, September 20th at 9am.</p><p></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><em><img   alt="IMG_1743.JPG" class="image-2 jive-image" src="9ad2600adb105f048c8ef4621f961929.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 399px;"/></em></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><em>The ServiceNow office at 150 Cheapside (lower right) as seen from the top of St. Paul's Cathedral. <br/>A lot of stairs were climbed for this photo.</em></p><p></p><p>In addition to learning a little about GDPR, I'm hitting sessions I missed at the previous conference, including one on security analytics from Gartner Analyst Anton Chuvakin. He defined security analytics as advanced analysis of data (not necessarily security data) to achieve a security-related outcome. Advanced analysis means going beyond traditional reporting or rule-based decisions into current hot terms like big data, artificial intelligence, or machine learning. A security outcome might include detection, alert triage, prioritization, response, or enterprise risk.</p><p></p><p>Build or Buy is often a key discussion for organizations when it comes to security. It's something we hear from current ServiceNow customers when it comes to security. "Should we buy a solution or build our own custom application that does exactly what we want?" There are arguments for and against, but it tends to come down to the work required to build and maintain a custom application versus buying something backed by a large team of dedicated developers.</p><p></p><p>The overall guidance from Chuvakin when it comes to security analytics was that organizations are more likely to succeed by buying with clear usage and tactical goals in mind. Why? Because building a security analytics solution from scratch requires significant time and money to achieve value. Building the logic for detection, triage, and prioritization can be difficult, whereas vendors in this space have more experience.</p><p></p><p>But it's also not so simple as buying a tool and getting great insights--you need people with the right analytics skillset plus the right mindset and culture to get value from the tool. And as perhaps my favorite slide of "The State of Security Monitoring and Analytics 2017" says, security data scientists are like unicorns. You may need to share resources and pair a data scientist who's not a security person with a security expert to get the combined skillset.</p><p></p><p>I've heard Chuvakin prioritize people and process over tools before in a session on building a modern security operations center. I think this is where the change in mindset is needed. Historically, companies have invested in tons of security tools (75 in the average enterprise) in hopes of protecting users and data. Tools alone aren't enough to be successful, as skilled people are needed to get value from the tools, and process provides a framework and direction for the people.</p><p></p><p>People with solid security skills aren't always easy to find. Several studies project this shortfall to continue or possibly worsen. So the correct processes and tools are needed to allow the people to be as efficient as possible. I think that's where ServiceNow Security Operations can make a differenceâ€”it's about using workflows and automation to make people more efficient.</p><p></p><p>Want to learn more about ServiceNow Security?
