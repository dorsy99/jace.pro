<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #303030;">The ServiceNow Global Services team and one of our partners recently worked with a leading comprehensive healthcare provider in the United States. By <strong>deploying ServiceNow ITBM in just 12 weeks,</strong> we helped them sunset their legacy solution, and</span><span style="color: #202020;"> take control of their apps, projects, and financials by giving them an operational view of their capacity utilization.</span></span></p><div class="section" style="background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);"><div class="column"><p><img   alt="health-banner.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="92a1a54edbd8d304b322f4621f961956.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 259px;"/></p></div></div><p><span style="color: #303030; font-size: 12pt;">As a national leader in healthcare, and constantly staying ahead in technology to maintain their leadership position, this organization is always looking for the best solutions to drive their business forward. As their EPMO Executive Director said, "we were suffering from death by a thousand manual spreadsheets and a lack of visibility across the portfolio". This led to the replacement of their current solution, with ServiceNow ITBM. With only weeks to go until their current solution was up for renewal, they reached out to ServiceNow Global Services and our partner to get the job done.</span></p><div class="section" style="background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);"><div class="column"><p></p></div></div><div class="section" style="background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);"><div class="column"><p><span style="color: #303030; font-size: 12pt;">Working closely with our partner â€” ServiceNow Global Services helped WellStar: </span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">Sunset their current system and successfully import 206 projects to ServiceNow</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">Go-live with 20 new users of PPM and Resource Management, and 549 new users of Time cards </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">Gain operational visibility into capacity utilization of resources vs. a task based view</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">Get more detailed visibility into projects, timelines, status and cost </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">Easily classify opex vs capex costs </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #303030;">Charge time to specific tasks for any given project </span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #202020;">For more information on what ServiceNow Global Services can do for you, visit our </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="https://www.servicenow.com/services/overview.html" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #3778c7;">page</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #202020;"> on Servicenow.com.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #202020; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica;">Learn how you can <a title="ww.servicenow.com/solutions/align-it-demand-to-business-strategy.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/align-it-demand-to-business-strategy.html">Take Control of your Apps, Projects, and Financials</a>.</span></p></div></div>
