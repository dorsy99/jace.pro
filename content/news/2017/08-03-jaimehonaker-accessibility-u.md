<p><span style="color: #3d3d3d;">With the Jakarta release, we have made</span> <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/accessibility-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/accessibility-rn.html">accessibility updates</a> <span style="color: #303030;">throughout the platform in relation to 508 compliance and WCAG 2.0 A and AA standards. While basic accessibility is included as part of the platform, these enhancements are meant to make the system more available and understandable to all users.</span></p><p><img   alt="10937399ecba071fe55abddebac4d774.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" height="302" src="05019086db949704ed6af3231f961919.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 403px; height: 302.25px;" width="403"/></p><p></p><h2></h2><h2>What is Section 508 and WCAG?</h2><p>Before jumping into the accessibility enhancements in Jakarta, here's a little background on why we have them in place. <a title="w.section508.gov/" href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> was signed into law in 1998, allowing for equal access to electronic and information technology. This means that a system is operated in a variety of different ways, not relying on a particular sense or ability of the operator. This expanded the previous Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as a result of the invention of the Internet, ensuring accessibility to web content. The <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/reference/r_VPAT.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/reference/r_VPAT.html">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> are a set of guidelines organized under four principles: websites must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Our goal in following these guidelines and principles is to make sure the interface is accessible to users with disabilities.</p><p></p><h1>What accessibility enhancements were made in Jakarta?</h1><p>We made several changes to accessibility throughout the platform. Here is a quick overview of each, but you can find more information for feature-specific changes in the corresponding documentation.</p><p></p><h2>Contrast UI theme</h2><p>New in the Jakarta release, the Contrast UI theme provides more options and accessibility for those who have a hard time distinguishing colors with low contrast levels. You can even make these changes yourself. The theme is one of the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/navigation-and-ui/reference/r_UI16BannerFrame.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/navigation-and-ui/reference/r_UI16BannerFrame.html">system settings for the user interface</a> that you can easily customize. I'll show you how to enable the Contrast UI theme in the next section.</p><p></p><h2>Color and style accessibility improvements</h2><p>In addition to the Contrast UI theme, these <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/concept/color-style-accessibility.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/concept/color-style-accessibility.html">color and style changes</a> make the platform more accessible:</p><ul><li>Improvements to alert color and font styles to make them more visible.</li><li>Switch any color-heavy graphics, such as charts or graphs, to use patterns in addition to colors.</li></ul><p><img   alt="Accessibility enabled charts.png" class="image-4 jive-image" height="387" src="0fee277ddb1c1fc03eb27a9e0f9619df.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 562px; height: 387.156px;" width="562"/></p><p></p><h2>Keyboard accessibility improvements</h2><p>These <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/concept/keyboard-accessibility.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/concept/keyboard-accessibility.html">keyboard accessibility</a> features allow users to navigate the platform using a keyboard:</p><ul><li>Tab order is consistent with expectations.</li><li>Button labeling.</li><li>Improved access to different UI elements.</li><li>Consistency for fields and UI elements that have hints (or tooltips).</li><li>Tab-through and arrow keys move items around in a slushbucket.</li><li>When focused on tabs, right and left arrow keys switch between tabs.</li><li>Arrow keys work within menus to navigate between entries.</li></ul><p></p><h2>Improvements for screen readers</h2><p>These <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/concept/screen-reader-accessibility.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/concept/screen-reader-accessibility.html">screen reader accessibility</a> improvements make the platform accessible to screen readers:</p><ul><li>Screen readers announce when a page reloads.</li><li>Add alternative text to styles. For example, you can add alternative text to the VIP style icon so that screen readers can call it out.</li><li>In Connect, screen readers inform users when a member leaves a conversation, when a user is added or removed from a chat, and when uploads complete or fail.</li></ul><p></p><p>For a full list of features in Jakarta that support WCAG to make the interface accessible to users, view the product documentation here: <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/task/t_SetUpSect508ComplianceFeature.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/accessibility-508-compliance/task/t_SetUpSect508ComplianceFeature.html">Accessibility features</a></p><p></p><h1>How to enable accessibility in the platform</h1><p>For accessibility within the platform, no additional configuration is needed and users just need to enable a user preference to make it more accessible. This turns on tabbing for each page, including every item, with the option to skip to different places on a page.</p><p></p><p>Use the gear icon, which is located within the banner frame, to display the system settings pop-up window (shown below), and the system settings are organized by tab. Those users with an admin role see the <strong>Switch to UI15</strong> button if UI16 is activated.</p><p></p><p>To enable accessibility:</p><ul><li>Users can enable this option from the <strong>system settings menu &gt; General tab</strong></li><li>Admins can do this on behalf of users by navigating to <strong>User Administration &gt; User preferences</strong>, and searching for the preference <strong>glide.ui.accessibility</strong></li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   class="image-1 jive-image" height="329" src="9043b442db5097041dcaf3231f96195e.iix" style="max-width: 800px; max-height: 600px; width: 688px; height: 328.52px;" width="688"/></p><h3></h3><p>This is just a small sample as to what is available with the release of Jakarta.
