<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14.6667px;">Please join me in the CreatorCon HackZone area at Knowledge this year for some ServiceNow Lego train automation madness!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Calibri;">Submit your order for Lego 'cargo' via the Service Portal and track your Item through all Stages of fulfillment in the instance. You'll see your train get dispatched to the rail yard, loaded with Lego bricks, and then return to the station for delivery. And if cargo operations is not your fancy, you can instead request a train ride over to the fairgrounds for a ferris wheel ride!</span></p><p></p><p><img   alt="IMG_0328 (1).jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="0c40a84adb9057041dcaf3231f961919.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 333px;"/></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14.6667px;">Technical details -&gt; for this project we are leveraging NodeJS on two Raspberry PIs coupled to 'BrickPI' motor control devices. A Scratch program controls multiple sensors and motors for handling train motion and track switching, as well as the cargo loading process and ferris wheel movement. The PIs are running Mid Servers which poll for jobs and update the ServiceNow Instance with the status of fulfillment - even uploading a photo to the Item showing the loading process live in the Activity Log. Finally, we have an Analytics Dashboard with a live cam and counters to help oversee train operations.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14.6667px;">Anyhow please stop by and chat. With any luck the train will work - and if not we can fix it together!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14.6667px;">--Ian</span></p>
