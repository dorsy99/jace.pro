<p>We're excited to be at Knowledge17 this year to show how the Actian hybrid integration platform can connect ServiceNow to your existing data sources, including on-premise and cloud-based applications. The ServiceNow model can define, structure and automate the flow of work within your enterprise, but only if you can connect to other applications and data supporting IT, human resources, facilities, field service and more. You certainly don't want to hand code your connections and map every field shared with Workday, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP and NetSuite.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Servicenow-Infographic-Build1.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="361" src="da372d46db58d7041dcaf3231f9619d3.iix" style="height: 361px; width: 763.891px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="764"/></p><p></p><p>Actian provides pre-built, certified integration connectors that map most of the commonly used fields across those popular applications and more. Actian also allows you to customize additional integrations through a drag-and-drop graphical user interface. How much time and effort could you save and how much faster could you start getting more value out of ServiceNow? Â  In our experience, the average time and cost to implement decreased by 50%, and there's minimal ongoing maintenance.</p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>With Actian DataConnect, you can orchestrate service transactions within a single service model</li><li>You can create and share a single system of record for service transactions that is instantly reflected back into other applications and services</li><li>Actian enables you to achieve the scale, reliability, and flexibility needed to rapidly grow adoption of the ServiceNow platform</li></ul><p></p><p>To get that 'lights-out, light-speed' experience through the ServiceNow enterprise cloud, you need invisible integration with existing applications and data across the enterprise.
