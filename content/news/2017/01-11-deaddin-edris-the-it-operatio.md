<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As someone who works in IT, I'm sure you can relate to the fact that you must always be available to address any issues that come up as they relate to your job.   In the same way, enterprises must always remain "on" and prevent service interruptions which can ultimately impact revenue, company reputation and customer satisfaction, while also providing their employees with the tools needed to do their jobs.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The ServiceNow <strong><a title="w.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/datasheets/ds-ServiceWatch-Suite.pdf" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/documents/datasheets/ds-ServiceWatch-Suite.pdf">ServiceWatch Suite</a></strong> provides enterprises with the ability to prevent service outages and manage cloud sprawl. We start by discovering business services and mapping to their associated infrastructure dependencies. This helps companies answer the tough questions, such as what services are affected if a certain server goes down? Or, how will our scheduled database maintenance affect the services provided to end-users? Additionally, ServiceWatch Suite solutions such as Event Management help reduce the noise from thousands of events from across all things IT, into a few actionable incidents giving teams the ability to prioritize and speed time to resolution. To keep their end users productive and embrace the agility of the cloud, ServiceWatch Cloud Management solution helps enterprises provide an easy self-service way for their developers to access cloud resources, without having to compromise on security or compliance, which ultimately helps manage cloud sprawl with the elimination of shadow IT, and out of control budgets. </span></p><p></p><h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What's New in Istanbul</span></h3><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Istanbul release, we have continued to innovate and focus on helping enterprises become service-aware by making it simple for them to perform key tasks. Here are some of the new additions to the ServiceWatch suite in this release: </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><a title="w.servicenow.com/products/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database.html">CMDB Query Builder</a></strong>: In Istanbul we have added the ability to query your CMDB for reports without having to write any code, giving enterprises an accurate, "at-your-fingertips" view of the IT environment. </span></p><p><span style="color: #eb7a3d; font-size: 10pt;"><em>(click image to enlarge)</em></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="CMDB Query Builder.png" height="388" src="6bee3006db901b04ed6af3231f9619bd.iix" width="781"/></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><a title="w.servicenow.com/products/discovery.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/discovery.html">Pattern Based Discovery</a></strong>: We added pattern-based Discovery so you can identify IT infrastructure with out-of-the-box discovery coverage and codeless custom discovery.   Codeless pattern-based discovery makes customized discovery easy, unifies patterns for both horizontal (infrastructure) and top-down (service map) discovery, and dramatically extends discovery coverage by introducing Service Mapping patterns. Discovery provides broad coverage out-of-the-box, including new technologies previously only discovered with Service Mapping, and an easy way to extend coverage further without coding.   </span></p><p><span style="color: #eb7a3d; font-size: 10pt;"><em>(click image to enlarge)</em></span></p><p></p><p><img  alt="ITOM-istanbul-launch-discovery.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="314" src="c803c50adbdc9304b322f4621f961921.iix" style="height: 314px; width: 683.088px;" width="683"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><a title="w.servicenow.com/products/service-mapping.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/service-mapping.html">Service Map Planner</a></strong>: Helps guide you through the process of building service maps with easy step by step instructions.
