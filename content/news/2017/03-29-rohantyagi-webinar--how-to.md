The formal definition of TTV is the time period between a business request and the initial delivery of the value requested. Simply put, it answers the question: "How long will it take to start adding value to my business?" For every CIO, TTV is one of the key performance indicators and any acceleration in TTV can have a major impact.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #3d3d3d; font-size: 10pt;">With this webinar, you will get a better understanding of the request management process and how Service Catalog should fit into your overall business.
