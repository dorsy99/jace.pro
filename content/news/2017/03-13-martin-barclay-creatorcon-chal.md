<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;">It was 140 days between the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="http://www.servicenow.com/company/ventures/creatorcon-challenge.html" rel="nofollow" style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: #3778c7;" target="_blank">CreatorCon Challenge</a> announcement on Sept 28th, 2016 and the entry deadline of February 15th, 2017.</p><p></p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;">Reaching out to startups in both the existing ServiceNow partner and developer ecosystem as well as outside to ISVs and developers on other platforms, with a call to action to transform their business on the ServiceNow platform, was a lot of fun and in the end, very rewarding for me personally and the broader ServiceNow team that made this possible - including senior execs CTO Allan Leinwand , SVP DevOps and Platform BU Pat Casey, VP of Finance and Corporate Development Dominic Phillips (who heads ServiceNow Ventures, the major sponsor of this competition), and Avanish Sahai (VP Worldwide ISVs and Technology Alliances).</p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"></p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;">But most importantly, the goal for the CreatorCon Challenge is that it be incredibly rewarding for the ISV startups that took on the Challenge and put forth tremendous innovation and effort in creating their apps and entry materials that were required in those seemingly really fast/blurred 140 days. I suppose that's a testament to the fact that you really can build high-impact, platform services-rich business apps really really fast on the ServiceNow platform (Ok, at Lightspeed). I'm sure we could put together a mathematical formula that could take the # of lines of Javascript and Angular JS code, # of workflows, # of   tables rows, # of API calls, # of orchestration activities, etc. etc. and divide by 140 to reach the magic number of 186,000. But I have better things to do.</p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"></p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;">Suffice to say, the Shortlist Startups with awesome leadership teams all built their revenue generating, high business impact delivering,   large and growing total available market-addressing, competitively differentiating and sustainable competitive advantaging (think moat), deep and wide platform service-using, technical viability-evidencing apps in just 140 days. That's pretty awesome.</p><p></p><p>To throw some meta-numbers on the board, we received 226 entries that completed at least the Personal/Company profile. 37 of those also completed the App profile and submitted App Materials (investor and/or on-screen app demo video).   Out of those 37, 17 met all of the by-design strict/high-bar eligibility criteria for both entity and entry eligibility.   And of those 17, 9 were selected to the Shortlist.</p><p></p><p>So without further adieu or to do, here are "The Nine", in alphabetical order.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.atlanticpuffin.io/"><img   alt="atlantic_puffin.PNG" class="image-1 jive-image" height="202.4" src="f1d189c2dbdc9344e9737a9e0f961973.iix" style="width: 424.4px; height: 202.272px;" width="424.4"/></a></p><p>Skillmix is an intelligent spatial management software.

From there, the execs will determine the three finalists that will be on-stage in the CreatorCon Challenge finale, immediately following the CreatorCon keynote on Thursday, May 11th in a general session in front of a few thousand <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/">Knowledge17</a> attendees. The finale will be a "shark tank" style event and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners will be determined by the <a title="ervicematters.servicenow.com/tech-legends-judge-clouds-biggest-contest-spring/" href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/tech-legends-judge-clouds-biggest-contest-spring/">"Legends of Tech" judging panel. </a> The winners will receive their share of <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=26fc66a5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961936">$500K in cash investments from ServiceNow Ventures, plus over $300K worth of marketing and business development prizes.</a></p><p></p><p>All nine of the above companies will get free trips to Knowledge17 (flight, hotel, transport to/from the airport/hotel) for two people from each company, plus full Knowledge17 passes and demo space in a sweet part of the centrally-located (smack dab in-between the ServiceNow Pavilion and the ExpoNow floor) <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/creatorcon.html" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/creatorcon.html">CreatorCon</a> Developer Hub (sweet = premium location, high foot-traffic).</p><p></p><p>The three winning apps will all be published to the <a title="tore.servicenow.com/" href="https://store.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow Store</a> on the Istanbul or Jarkarta release by the end of August for delivery to all ServiceNow customers globally.

There were some really awesome apps that didn't make the shortlist but that we have identified and called out to the ServiceNow partner sales team twho will be in contact with them about go-to-market planning and sales engagement as we fully expect that ServiceNow customers will want to see those apps on the Store as well.</p><p></p><p>Stay tuned to hear who the three finalists are - they will be announced on April 12th!</p>
