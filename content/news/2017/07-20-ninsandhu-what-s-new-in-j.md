Â  </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">And enhanced capabilities like <strong>Assisted Migration</strong> to <strong>Scoped Product</strong>, <strong>Bulk Case Creation</strong>, <strong>Personalized PDF</strong> and <strong>Signed Document</strong>.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="; color: #7030a0; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Enterprise Onboarding and Transitions</strong></span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Onboarding.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="3d3d048adb509fc03eb27a9e0f9619e1.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 350px;"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In this release, we recognized that consumerizing the employee service experience just doesn't stop at what happens with HR, it's so much more than that. ServiceNow's new Enterprise Onboarding and Transitions application now orchestrates and automates employee onboarding, offboarding, relocation, leaves of absence and other processes that begin in HR but span multiple systems and departments such as IT, security, facilities, finance and legal. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For many employees, getting onboarding and other services fulfilled from HR has been a time-consuming and frustrating process. But now, HR can finally give employees that complete consumerized service experience they deserve with a single destination for all their onboarding and other HR service needs, all while drastically improving their own efficiency in the process! </span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"><img   alt="Onboarding ESC.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="56caa73ddb1893041dcaf3231f9619b4.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 394px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></span></p><p></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"><a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=BHyfslFhkeA&t=1s&list=PLtPPHGXv_JplZtVzMmObTFNEk5MijTx6k&index=37" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHyfslFhkeA&amp;t=1s&amp;list=PLtPPHGXv_JplZtVzMmObTFNEk5MijTx6k&amp;index=37">Watch the Demo</a></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">If you didn't get a chance to attend our Knowledge 17 conference event this year, re-live some of the Enterprise Onboarding and Transitions launch highlights </span><a href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/video-library.html?tab=hr"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">here</span></a><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Other new Jakarta highlights include:</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #7030a0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Assisted Migration to Scoped HR Service Delivery Product</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Stay current with all the new HR features and functionality moving forward.

Whether you're onboarding/offboarding multiple employees or need to fix a payroll run issue, with bulk case creation, HR can now easily select a group of employees and automatically create a case for each, with just one click.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong> <img   alt="bulk case creation feature.png" class="image-8 jive-image" src="d1de6406dbd857049c9ffb651f961913.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 259px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><br/></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #7030a0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Personalized PDF and Signed Document</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Go Paperless and streamline communications with editable, personalized PDFs and electronic signatures.
