<p>The second and final day of the Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit in London was a bit more quiet. Perhaps people were exhausted after day one, which clocked in at 12 and a half hours! Today in the interest of learning something different, I attended two sessions by Gartner Research Director Christie Struckman, who focuses on organizational change and business transformation.</p><p></p><p>Security tends to focus on technology of some sort, whether that's tools or threats. However, people are at the core, from security analysts and IT to engineers who build the tools to hackers and everyone else in between. Often these people are in conflict, which is the basis of drama, which is at the heart of a good story. A story without conflict would be pretty boring.</p><p></p><p>You might be wondering why on earth I'm talking about stories in a security blog. That's because one of these people-focused sessions was about using storytelling to enhance risk and security awareness.</p><p></p><p>We tell stories all the time in the security industry. Generally they're cautionary tales about some company who was breached and suffered, and therefore we should do something different so the same thing doesn't happen to us. Sound familiar? Struckman challenged the audience to think about telling security stories in a different way lest we all sound too much like the boy who cried wolf.</p><p></p><p>First, let's take a quick detour and talk about why stories are important. Think of your favorite book, movie, or TV show. I bet you could easily tell someone about the plot or characters even if you haven't read or watched it in ages. Stories stick with us. In fact, Struckman showed how stories activate different parts of the brain, such as the motor, auditory, visual, and olfactory cortexes. Compare that to facts and figures, which primarily impact the language processing and comprehension centers.</p><p></p><p>In addition, stories can affect behavior. The key is finding the correct motivator and getting your audience to empathize. Plain facts and figures are open to interpretation, but you can use a story to control the interpretation of data in order to influence your desired outcome.</p><p></p><p>Let's take the oft-cited Ponemon Institute numbers as an example. In 2015, it took organizations on average 201 days to identify a breach. In 2016, it took 191 days. If I just give you that data alone, you might not be certain what the point is. Maybe I'm trying to tell you the general trend is improving or maybe I'm trying to say those numbers are much too big and are holding fairly steady year over year. You need more context and direction.</p><p></p><p>Instead, I could say that security teams have toiled long hours trying to deal with thousands of security alerts from dozens of disparate tools. These often understaffed teams work hard to keep their organizations safe but are bogged down with manual tasks that consume too much of their time. This has led to long detection times averaging over six months when a breach occurs.</p><p></p><p>Sure, it required a lot more words, but aren't you now sympathetic to these overworked teams? Would you like to do something to help them decrease the alerts and manual tasks that are leading to these long detection times? Maybe my example was a little more dramatic than you'd use in a business setting, but I think you see the point.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img  alt="2526909_orig.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="8de91486db185304b322f4621f96192d.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p>Remember this standard story structure you learned in school? Even if you never had any dreams of becoming a playwright or novelist, it's still applicable in your work. However, Struckman recommended the resolution ending on more of a cliffhanger. Security is a journey rather than a destination. This won't be the only story you tell, so you need to leave room for part two (or more).</p><p></p><p>Which brings me to my own part two: strategic thinking. "How to Teach Your Organization to Think Strategically About Security" focused on a different kind of conflict: decision making. Often we hear statements like "that's not how it works here" or "we can't do that" when trying to create or implement something new. Struckman reviewed three methods of strategic thinking to challenge the don'ts and can'ts.</p><p></p><p>The Socratic Method is all about asking questions to challenge assumptions and stimulate critical thinking. Let's assume you'd like to create a new process to enroll users who click on links in phishing emails in a new training. You might achieve resistance but can start questioning it to dig deeper. Why? Maybe they tried it before and it wasn't successful. Why wasn't it successful? Through this questioning, you can uncover the source of the resistance and come up with ways to make it work.</p><p></p><p>The next method is termed "debate club." Like on a school debate team, people argue for and against an issue and present rebuttals to those arguments. It requires people have a good understanding of both sides to present solid arguments. This might be better suited to the next phase of your project or initiative. Socratic Method got you to the what or the planning phase, and debate can get you to the how or the build phase.</p><p></p><p>The last method is an educational framework called Bloom's Taxonomy. Struckman primarily focused on the "understand" through "evaluate" phases of the diagram below. This can be used in the run phase.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="29428436431_170dc675d7_o.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="1dda7c8edbd89304b322f4621f961928.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;"/></p><p></p><p>The end goal is to achieve well-thought decisions that are likely to stick. It requires more work upfront, but ultimately you save time by (hopefully) revisiting decisions less frequently.</p><p></p><p>That wraps my highlights from this year's conference. The crew is now dismantling all the exhibitor booths with amazing efficiency. I'm in London through the end of this week to check out our GDPR seminar tomorrow, and then I'm off to the Splunk user conference in Washington D.C. September 25-28. Come visit booth G11 if you're attending.</p>
