<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In an emergency, how do you check the location of every staff member and every visitor to your work site? If you don't have a plan, that's an issue. Even if your organisation prints forms for your fire wardens to cross-check by hand at the evacuation point, that's still an issue—who's using the printer during a fire or an earthquake?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span lang="EN-AU">The team at <a title="w.enableps.com.au/products/" href="http://www.enableps.com.au/products/">Enable</a> </span><span lang="EN-AU"> </span><span lang="EN-AU">is taking the worry out of site evacuation with EvacuApp—an intelligent app powered on the ServiceNow platform.

On any given day, your staff may be in a variety of locations, and you may have hundreds of visitors on site. In an emergency, it can be impossible to alert, track and protect everyone. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">But EvacuApp tracks the location of every person and allows them to indicate their wellbeing. It not only improves efficiency in an emergency, but increases your site's safety — you quickly know who needs help and where to find them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span lang="EN-AU"><a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=WDi-zNmRYlg&t=170s" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDi-zNmRYlg&amp;t=170s">Watch this video</a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> </span><span lang="EN-AU">to learn how the app works</span></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span lang="EN-AU">Then, do a </span><a title="tore.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/search?q=enableps" href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/search?q=enableps">free test drive of EvacuApp</a><span lang="EN-AU"> Even better, come see the Enablers at booth #532 at Knoweldge17</span></span></p>
