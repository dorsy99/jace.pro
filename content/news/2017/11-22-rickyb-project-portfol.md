<p>At ServiceNow we use a very different clich√© than "eat our own dog food", instead we say we "drink our own champagne". And rightfully so, ServiceNow's IT products are saving enterprises millions of dollars so it's only logical that we implement our products and reap those benefits. The first product to be adopted internally was IT Service Management with Performance Analytics. Having the information that Performance Analytics provides IT, was able to make fast and effective decisions. Leveraging the power of the platform Tomer Mekhty, Senior Director of IT, saved the company 1.6 million per year in operating costs by automating over 50 processes and 200 tasks and provided a better experience for ServiceNow employees. The details of that success can be found here: <a title="ervicematters.servicenow.com/2017/06/05/now-now-servicenows-journey-lightspeed-enterprise/" href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2017/06/05/now-now-servicenows-journey-lightspeed-enterprise/">https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2017/06/05/now-now-servicenows-journey-lightspeed-enterprise/</a></p><p></p><p>Next up IT focused on its project work. They took a long, hard look at how they gathered demand, managed resources and projects and decided to go all-in with Project Portfolio Management. Taifa Harris, director of IT Business Operations led the transition, and now every aspect of ServiceNow's Global IT Project Portfolio including idea, demand, portfolio, project and resource planning is driven from ITBM.</p><p></p><p>With full use of ITBM for Project and Portfolio Management, we've realized the following key benefits:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>20% acceleration in time-to-value from project approval to capability delivery</li><li>60% reduction in average time to screen and approve projects</li><li>4,342 hours saved per year through real-time reporting and dashboards</li><li>$354,900 saved each year in project management costs</li></ul><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">For all the details on this Now on Now success story, take a look at a recent blog post by Chris Bedi, ServiceNow's CIO at:</p><p><a title="ervicematters.servicenow.com/2017/11/10/servicenow-uses-itbm-accelerate-project-delivery-20/" href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2017/11/10/servicenow-uses-itbm-accelerate-project-delivery-20/">https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2017/11/10/servicenow-uses-itbm-accelerate-project-delivery-20/</a></p><p></p><p>For more information on PPM and the entire ITBM product suite visit: <a title="ww.servicenow.com/products/business-management.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/business-management.html">https://www.servicenow.com/products/business-management.html</a></p><p>Isn't time for you to get your own bottle of champagne!</p>
