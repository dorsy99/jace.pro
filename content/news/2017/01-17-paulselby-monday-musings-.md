<p>The annual Consumer Electronics Show (or CES) recently concluded. Didn't make it to the show? That's okay - the <a title="w.dailyherald.com/article/20170114/business/170119469/" href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20170114/business/170119469/">Daily Herald</a> (via AP) summarized nine top trends at CES. Including the Â  Internet of Things (or IOT) on its list, they said "This year, manufacturers are keen on connecting even the most seemingly mundane objects to the Internet," highlighting such new devices as connected coffee makers, mirror, and even a hairbrush in the article.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a hairbrush.</p><p><img  alt="9U3A1946.0.0.jpeg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="131" src="d8a23b35db9c1fc068c1fb651f9619a4.iix" style="width: 196px; height: 130.56129032258065px;" width="196"/></p><p></p><p>As more and more such "mundane objects" are connected to the Internet, companies and consumers are reaping new benefits from being connected. As a company, though, it also creates new opportunities to improve product quality and service.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Collecting Information</span></h1><p>Connecting a device like a mirror used to get ready in the morning to the Internet seems odd at first, until you consider benefits like up-to-date weather information ("Should I use that stronger gel due to the humidity?") and current travel time to work. The right details delivered in a timely manner in the context of using your product can be incredibly useful to your customer. For your company, this also creates the opportunity to better understand how they are using your product: perhaps customers struggle with a certain feature or some features go unused. This type of telemetry is incredibly beneficial in ongoing product development.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when collecting any information from customers, make sure you are honoring their privacy. Notify them in a user agreement or other disclosure of the fact that information is being gathered and for what purposes it is being used.</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Monitoring Performance</span></h1><p><span style="color: #303030;">In addition to understanding how customers are using your products, you have the ability to track performance. Are things running within the expected tolerances for speed, temperature, humidity, time-of-day, or any other parameter relevant to the product and its usage by the customer ? Similar to collecting customer usage information, the product performance can also help drive future improvements.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #303030;">More importantly, you can monitor if the device is heading towards a problem. Are there any indicators that something could be about to go wrong? Or have things have stopped working completely? If there's a breakdown, that leads us to...</span></p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Delivering Fixes and Enhancement</span></h1><p>When you've identified things might be going wrong or that they have gone wrong, IoT devices also make it possible to address those issues with reduced reliance on the customer. Software/firmware fixes can be delivered directly to the impacted device without any intervention by the customer. Not only is this convenient to the customer, but it also minimizes impact on your service center when a call, email, or chat is other avoided because, ideally, the customer never experiences the failure. What about fixes that don't require a software update? In those cases, customers can be called or emailed to inform them of the instructions they should follow to ensure the product doesn't experience any issues.</p><p></p><p>An example of this type of ongoing problem avoidance and product improvement is the car maker Tesla. Not only do they address issues with the vehicle's onboard systems and software, they also deliver new features. The release of their self-driving features (as well as ongoing updates to it) have rolled out in this manner - all without requiring the customer to bring the car to the dealer or even to perform any manual steps directly with the car's onboard systems, a huge savings in time for the customer as well as the dealership.</p><p></p><p>While it's not clear what kind of fixes "over the air" a hairbrush might need, it's still possible!</p><p></p><h1><span style="color: #e23d39;">Your Offerings</span></h1><p>Connecting products to the Internet can create newfound benefits, both for customers and your business. Are you already utilizing IoT with your products? In what manner? What types of benefits are you seeing? </p>
