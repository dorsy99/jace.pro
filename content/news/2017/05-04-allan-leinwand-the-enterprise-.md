<p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">In this episode of The Enterprise Cloudcast, I discuss the very complex topic of data sovereignty. Understanding this topic in some depth is required for many groups within the enterprise, including: application development and architecture, security, legal, compliance and others. We need to understand and appreciate many aspects of data sovereignty as we move to put more workloads to the cloud.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">How do we think about the regularity and compliance needs of the many data sovereignty laws across the world while using cloud computing to drive our company forward? </span><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Are data sovereignty and cloud computing at odds with each other or can we make them work together?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">In this podcast, I talk about one strategy to think about when discussing with data sovereignty. Please bear in mind that this podcast is just an introduction to this topic - but hopefully a useful and relevant one in the world of Brexit, FedRAMP, GDPR and more!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><a __default_attr="6735" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="The Enterprise Cloudcast: Episode 9: Data Sovereignty by Allan Leinwand" data-renderedposition="251_8_411_17" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=4faca625dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96199b" modifiedtitle="true" title="The Enterprise Cloudcast: Episode 9: Data Sovereignty">The Enterprise Cloudcast: Episode 9: Data Sovereignty by Allan Leinwand</a> </span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Please let me know if you have any comments!</span></p>
