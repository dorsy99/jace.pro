<p>As a ServiceNow consultant for almost 5 years, I am thrilled with the capabilities the platform brings to the table and the way we are able to transform our client's environment leveraging its potential to the fullest. This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> ServiceNow conference and Infosys is a 'Platinum' sponsor this year, all set to showcase path breaking solutions at the Expo, in booth 107. </p><p>As we all know that this is the best time for networking and demonstrating the power of the ServiceNow platform with takeaways being learnings to solve the business problems of your customer at light speed. Almost in every industry and space we are seeing the presence of automation, robotic learning, intuitive user experience, mobility and a zeal to make it even better day in day out. </p><p>It's to cater to this upcoming need, we have developed some cool solutions which will be on display at our booth. The key showcases include: Enabling <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Artificial Intelligence on ServiceNow</strong> platform, along with a couple of exciting dashboards such as <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Event management dashboard</strong> - displaying what are the key business services impacted and whether the issue in hand has worsened or bettered, and keep track of the progress of the same, and a <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-service dashboard</strong> —   Helps analyze how users in your organization are using self-service, knowledge articles, service catalog and what you need to do, in order to effectively measure its success. </p><p></p><p>Another area of interest which is growing today is on embarking on a <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">journey beyond ITSM.</strong> How do I capitalize on the new capabilities which ServiceNow is innovating in? Some of the answers such as what should be my <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">upgrade strategy</strong>, how frequently should I upgrade, and what are the common pitfalls to watch out for, during and after the upgrade. We have also developed an HR portal which will take the HR services to the next level ensuring a great user experience even before the employee joins the organization.   </p><p>Watch out for live demos of these solutions and take part in an exciting gaming challenge at our booth to win some cool goodies.</p><p></p><p>Apart from all these exciting showcases, we are also having <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">2 TheaterNow sessions</strong> — one is focused on Artificial Intelligence and the other one on the journey beyond ITSM. We will innovate ideas and display how you can employ these solutions in your enterprise to '<strong>Reimagine Service Experience with Purposeful AI'</strong>.</p><p></p><p>I look forward to meeting you in Orlando, as the fun begins in a few days and I'm sure together, we'll set the fire blazing for the future at Knowledge 17. </p><p><img  class="image-1 jive-image" src="1f5b0006db1c1344e9737a9e0f96193c.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p>
