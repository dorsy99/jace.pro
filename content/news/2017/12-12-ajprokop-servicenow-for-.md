<h1 class="Heading">An Imperfect Word</h1><p class="Heading"></p><p>Software crashes.   Electronic components overheat and burnout.   Mechanical systems fail.   Shipments get lost.   Customers become irate.   In short, no matter how much disaster planning we do and how many fail-safes we implement, issues, problems, and/or disasters will always be a part of day-to-day business life.</p><p></p><h1 class="Heading">Growing Pains</h1><p class="Heading"></p><p>As organizations grow, add new product lines, hire employees, expand into new regions, and generally carry on the day-to-day business of staying in business, incident management becomes a daunting task.   It is imperative to assign the right resources to the most pressing problems in a timely manner while preventing "fire drills" that interrupt and stifle productivity.   The failure to properly manage incidents can lead to reduced customer satisfaction, overworked employees, safety issues, product flaws, and a loss of revenue.</p><p></p><p>To solve the problem of incident management, enterprises are turning to ServiceNow.   Not only do ServiceNow applications consolidate incident reporting into a single, highly available database, but they track those incidents from cradle to grave.</p><p></p><h1 class="Heading">Avaya Breeze Integration</h1><p class="Heading"></p><p>The Avaya Breeze<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> platform is an integrated environment providing capabilities that extend across both the Unified Communications space and the Contact Center space to allow Breeze Snap-Ins (i.e. Breeze applications) to be built in a way that reflects real business processes and customer requirements, rather than technology silos.</p><p></p><p>Arrow Systems Integration (Arrow SI) has developed software that allows the benefits of ServiceNow to be easily integrated into Breeze Snap-Ins.   Snap-In developers simply drag the ServiceNow tasks onto the Engagement Designer palette to create workflows that add ServiceNow incident reporting (create, retrieve, update, and delete) to Breeze's existing toolkit of web services, telephony, SMS and email notification, decision logic, database access, and work assignment services. </p><p></p><p>Combined with Arrow SI's Internet of Things (IoT) tasks, enterprises can now create extremely powerful solutions that blend communications workflow management with ServiceNow cloud incident reporting.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="ServiceNow.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="0fd9c40edb1c1304b322f4621f9619e6.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 251px;"/></p><p></p><p class="Heading"><strong>Use Cases</strong></p><p class="Heading"></p><p>The use cases for incident reporting within a Breeze workflow are nearly infinite.   Examples include:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Data access failures</li><li>Error conditions from cloud services</li><li>Communications failures</li><li>Abnormal conditions detected by IoT sensors</li></ul><p></p><p>Using Incident Reporting from Arrow Systems Integration, problems can be reported, technicians dispatched, contact center agents engaged, etc.   The ultimate result is that issues are automatically detected, reported, and managed.   This leads to quick resolution times with minimal to no loss of service.</p><p></p><h1 class="Heading">Arrow Systems Integration</h1><p class="Heading"></p><p><span style="color: black;">For more information on the Arrow Insight Breeze Incident Reporting Services or Arrow Systems Integration, contact us at </span><a title="visoryservices@arrowsi.com" href="mailto:advisoryservices@arrowsi.com">advisoryservices@arrowsi.com</a>.</p><p><span style="color: black;">855-732-7769</span></p>
