<h2>System Administrator</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As most new ServiceNow administrators that I meet, I started with the 3 days &#34;<a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/system-administration.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>ServiceNow System Administration Training</strong></a>&#34; ($2100), that you can pass with ServiceNow or one of its official certified training partners. As an alternative you may also consider this Udemy 7 hours online course &#34;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/servicenow-101-administration/" rel="nofollow"><strong>ServiceNow 101: Administration</strong></a>&#34; as an economic alternative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, how do you improve on your technical knowledge of the platform, and what steps could you apply to assert your experience?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After this introductory course, you&#39;re expected to gain experience in the field, while administering your instance. Many administrators stop their curriculum here, but you many opportunities to improve. Let me present you some possible next steps…</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Certified System Administrator</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>After 3-6 months of experience, you may confirm that you&#39;re no more a rookie by passing the &#34;<a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/certified-system.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>ServiceNow Certified System Administrator</strong></a>&#34; certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This <a title="w.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/other-documents/training/ServiceNow-Sys-Admin-Exam-Specs.pdf" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/other-documents/training/ServiceNow-Sys-Admin-Exam-Specs.pdf" rel="nofollow">exam&#39;s scope</a> is mapped to the three days ServiceNow System Administration Training.</p>
<p><img class="image-1 jive-image" style="width: 620px; height: 124px;" src="e65a7bb9db14d3041dcaf3231f961949.iix" alt="Sample-Question-ServiceNow-Certified-System-Administrator-.png" /></p>
<p>The 60 minutes&#39; exam contains 65 multipleâ€‘choice questions and cost USD $150.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Developer Portal tutorials</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some nice<strong> <a title="eveloper.servicenow.com/app.do#!/training/landing?v&#61;helsinki" href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/training/landing?v&#61;helsinki" rel="nofollow">tutorials on the Developer Portal</a></strong>. You can follow them to learn a few new tricks to add to your belt.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Scripting in ServiceNow</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I plan to publish a dedicated article on the great online courses I found to learn and progress as a JavaScript developer. As for ServiceNow, if you need help to progress on the scripting and Javascript side, there is a 3 day &#34;<a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/scripting-in-servicenow-training.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Scripting in ServiceNow</strong></a>&#34; course ($2100). I did not take this one, so I invite other readers to post their feedback as comments.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Certified Implementation Specialist</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>After 12-36 months of experience, for Services Partner Implementation Specialists, or anyone who wants to follow a path to becoming an Implementation consultant, you may want to confirm that you&#39;re an expert by passing the &#34;<a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/certified-implementation-specialist.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>ServiceNow Certified Implementation Specialist</strong></a>&#34; certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exams could be quite difficult because the scope is often wider than most admin encounter when they manage a single instance. You&#39;ll need to be familiar with all scripting options, JavaScript, workflows, application security, Scrum for SDLC, LDAP integration, CMDB, web services, and many processes with their best practices… So, depending of your experience and the instances you managed, you may have to learn and experiment with a number features that you are not familiar with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To prepare for this exam, most administrators register for a five days&#39; <a href="http://www.servicenow.com/services/training-and-certification/implementation-bootcamp.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Implementation Bootcamp</strong></a>. The boot camp is not mandatory, and if you&#39;re good at self-studies, you may skip it and aim directly for the exam, like I did in 2013.</p>
<p><img class="image-2 jive-image" style="width: 620px; height: 148px;" src="2d5c5106db5c1b04ed6af3231f9619ec.iix" alt="Sample-Question-ServiceNow-Certified-Implementation-Specialist-.png" /></p>
<p>The 90 minutes&#39; exam contains 65 multipleâ€‘choice questions and cost USD $200. You can have a look at the <a title="w.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/other-documents/training/ds-certified-Impl-Specialist-Blueprint.pdf" href="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/other-documents/training/ds-certified-Impl-Specialist-Blueprint.pdf" rel="nofollow">exam blueprint</a> to check example questions and requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Keeping up to date with Technical Consultant Accreditations</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>For registered technical partners and ServiceNow&#39;s employees, the &#34;<a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://partnerportal.service-now.com/portalapp/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0010104" rel="nofollow"><strong>ServiceNow Learning Portal</strong></a>&#34; provides some very nice interactive trainings who grant Technical Accreditations over more than a dozen subjects in the Services Enablement section. Those include Incident Management, Change Management, Project Portfolio Suite, Performance Analytics, Service Portal, Human Resource (HR) Management, Technical Best Practices… The quality of the training is sometimes irregular, and configuring an Amazon AWS account is quite complicated, but the interactive implementation simulators (SPLI) you&#39;ll get are great tools to learn new domains, and kept your knowledge up to date with the latest releases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Implementation Simulator consists of a series of project implementation components. Tasks that are part of each component will be presented to the learner within a dedicated ServiceNow instance. Once each task is completed and submitted, the task is automatically assessed for accuracy and completeness, which provides the learner immediate feedback on the work that was done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The interactive trainings will take from 3 hours to 2 days each, and you only have to pay the few dollars required for the Amazon hosting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After you complete the simulator and an online exam, you&#39;ll be granted a Technical Accreditation on a specific domain, valid for about two years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If ServiceNow were to allow this outside of its Partner program, it would be a great boon for customer&#39;s administrators. In the meantime, you could try to convince your company to sign the ParterNow agreement to <a title="ww.servicenow.com/partners/become-a-partner.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/partners/become-a-partner.html" rel="nofollow">become an official ServiceNow Partner</a>.</p>
