<p>Don't Panic!   The words written on the cover of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - It's a good thing, too, because the sheer volume of information required to hitchhike across galaxies would be pretty massive.   Overwhelming.   In fact, Panic Inducing. </p><p></p><p>(If you are wondering about the Hitchhikers Guide, then run, don't walk, your fingertips to download and read Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker series - no need to thank me, and no worries, I'll wait while you finish… finished? Know where your towel is? Good.) </p><p></p><p>It occurs to me that Don't Panic is a great motto for Security Operations too.   Not because it isn't panic inducing (it absolutely is), but because the security world is an overwhelming mass of potentially confusing and sometimes seemingly conflicting information, from an enormous mass of different sources. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, like the 'Guide, there is a potential single source to collect, organize, prioritize all of this different information into useful bits - the ServiceNow platform and the SecOps suite.     </p><p></p><p>Now I'd tell you that this can be a fun space, and you'll need to have this fish in your ear.   But then I'd have to send you back to the Hitchhikers Guide, and you'd probably be a bit confused. </p><p></p><p>So instead I thought it might be good to have a starting place to get an overview understanding both of the Security Operations Applications, and some of the basic tasks / skills you will need to understand to manage and administer those applications. Something like, well this training class... </p><p><a title="ervicenow.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA1PRD0015/common/ledetail/ES-SN-OPS" href="https://servicenow.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA1PRD0015/common/ledetail/ES-SN-OPS" style="color: #954f72; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">https://servicenow.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA1PRD0015/common/ledetail/ES-SN-OPS</a></p><p></p><p>I hope to see you there, but just in case I'll let you know to keep an eye out for more of these posts - I'll be collaborating with a few others (like <a title="benforrest" __default_attr="58901" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive-link-profile-small jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-id="58901" data-objecttype="3" data-orig-content="benforrest" data-renderedposition="427_899.46875_83_16" data-type="person" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=fb9e022ddbd41fc09c9ffb651f961975">benforrest</a>, <a __default_attr="39264" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive-link-profile-small jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-id="39264" data-objecttype="3" data-orig-content="steevquayle" data-renderedposition="427_990.03125_94_16" data-type="person" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=adb01aaddb581fc09c9ffb651f9619f9" modifiedtitle="true" title="steevquayle">steevquayle</a>, <a title="diane.cunningham" __default_attr="3120" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive-link-profile-small jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-id="3120" data-objecttype="3" data-orig-content="diane.cunningham" data-renderedposition="448_8_134_16" data-type="person" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=c3a212addbd81fc09c9ffb651f961954">diane.cunningham</a>, and others)   to post some more information both about SecOps and about some of the more administrative components common to this and other applications… so stay tuned!   And Don't Panic! </p>
