<p>The <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/concept/c_ServiceCatalogManagement.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/concept/c_ServiceCatalogManagement.html">Service Catalog</a> is one of the most popular applications in ServiceNow. Being able to to automate and process orders seamlessly just makes our lives a hundred times easier. Alas, in certain patches of Geneva and Helsinki (mostly Helsinki though), your Submit Request, aka Order Now, button can go *poof* missing. This causes a huge gap in your workflow as your end users can't order what they need to onboard or be efficient.</p><p></p><h1>Missing Submit (Order Now) button in a Service Request</h1><p>This issue can look like a completely missing Submit button in the Service Catalog or having it disappear before you are able to submit the request. When your <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0621186" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0621186">cart layout doesn't function correctly</a>, your organization can't function correctly. This blooper happens when Price, Quantity or Subtotal are unchecked in the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/task/t_ConfigOTMAndShopCartWidget.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/task/t_ConfigOTMAndShopCartWidget.html">Item Ordering Widget</a>.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="missing order button1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="600a49c2db1c97041dcaf3231f96198d.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 237px;"/></p><p></p><p>If you navigate to the <strong>Maintain Cart Layouts</strong> and open the <strong>Shopping Cart Widget</strong>, and see that <strong>Visible and save</strong> is unchecked, this may be the culprit for you missing Submit button. Next, hop down to <strong>Item Ordering Widget</strong> and double check to see which components are checked and unchecked. If your price, quantity and subtotal are unchecked, simply switch them to checked -- and you should be good to go.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="order now button 1.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="e0f9ec02db1857049c9ffb651f961971.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 253px;"/></p><p></p><p>This should be fixed in Helsinki Patch 9, Istanbul Patch 3, and in Jakarta!
