You may be missing out on the larger picture. What about those bothersome incidents that just seem to keep popping up in the queue day after day? Yes, they may be easy to fix with a simple reboot of the machine, but perhaps there's a bigger issue going on. These recurring incidents are often tied to one another via more systemic issues (aka "problems") that may need to be solved soon before other services can be reliably restored. Otherwise, you're prone to not only have the same incident occur over and over again, but run the risk of it leading to a bigger issue. Plus, who really wants to live Groundhog's Day?</p><p></p><p>For sanity's sake, consider adopting problem management as part of your IT process portfolio. ServiceNow Problem Management makes identifying the commonality between connected incidents easier by using structured problem analysis methodology. Features such as Root Cause Analysis allow you to correlate problems with recent activities (like changes), and achieve remediation sooner. Additionally, role-based reports and dashboards included with Problem Management help you communicate active and resolved problems to larger teams, and provide real-time transparency into operations.</p><p></p><p>Does this sound like like something your IT organization could benefit from? <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=49bc6a25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619ac">Join us</a> for a live webinar on July 5<sup>th</sup> to learn what the problem management process is all about, the value it brings to your organization and how you can get started with ServiceNow Problem Management today.
