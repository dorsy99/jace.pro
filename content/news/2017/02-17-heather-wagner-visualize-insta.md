<p><span style="color: #505050;">On the</span> <a title=".service-now.com/hisp" href="http://hi.service-now.com/hisp">HI Service Portal</a>, <span style="color: #505050;">you've always been able to check your instance's availability for the past 90 days on the Real Availability dashboard. Systems availability, or "uptime" as some call it, is an important indicator for many businesses. Many of our customers told us that they would like to be able to see more than 90 days of instance availability, in order to evaluate their overall systems availability to their users. Some have said they want to be able to export the information, so it can be included in regular reports to leadership, or so they can design their own report. Up to now, the way to do that has been to contact your account manager or call support to ask for the information- and even then it was limited to one month at a time. What a hassle!</span></p><p></p><h1>New ways to visualize instance availability in the Real Availability dashboard</h1><p><span style="color: #505050;">We've developed a new page for our Real Availability which allows YOU to decide how much information you'd like. You can easily pick set date ranges, or customize your own.</span></p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2017-02-14 at 10.53.55 AM.png" class="image-13 jive-image" src="3972e48edb9057049c9ffb651f96190c.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 157px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>View preset time ranges 90 days, 120 days, and 180 days past in calendar form</h2><p><span style="color: #505050;">Sometimes it's difficult to really see which days may have been impacted by an outage when you're looking at the chicklets. To help with this, when you click on "more details" for an instance, you'll be taken to a new page where you can See up to 12 months of availability information in an easy-to-read and mobile friendly calendar.</span></p><p><span style="color: #505050;">We've already set time ranges for 3, 6, and 9 months (90, 120, and 180 days) to make those easy to select, as those have been some of our most frequent requests.</span></p><p></p><p><img   alt="time range real availability.jpg" class="image-17 jive-image" src="03e14842db541344e9737a9e0f961995.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 406px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><h2><span style="line-height: 1.5;">View a custom time range to see a year of availability or just this week's</span></h2><p><span style="color: #505050; line-height: 1.5;">Sometimes you need a much shorter range of information; and sometimes you want longer. Perhaps you'd like to see how your availability was the week you were on vacation. Just want to see since the beginning of the year? You can do that! If there's any impact to your instance shown, you'll be able to see those incidents right on the page.</span></p><p><img   alt="Instance availability status.jpg" class="image-18 jive-image" src="43a469c2db1053043eb27a9e0f9619ac.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 398px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Share instance availability with your team by exporting PDF, Excel, or CSV files</h2><p><span style="color: #505050;">Export it in the format that works best for YOU. If you want to share what you see on the screen, export to a PDF. Want to get the information on your issues and make your own chart to show what happened when your network was upgraded? Export to CSV or EXCEL. </span></p><p><img   alt="Export instance availability.jpg" class="image-19 jive-image" src="01de7c02db9c9344e9737a9e0f961979.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 257px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p><br/> If you need some help navigating the new pages, just activate the tour in our<strong> HI Help</strong> menu and we'll walk you through the page.
