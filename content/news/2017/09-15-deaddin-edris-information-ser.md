<p><span style="color: #303030; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Recently, our Global Services team - along with one of our partners - had the </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">pleasure</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of working with <span style="color: #303030; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">a member of the Forbes Global 2000 list. This company is a leader in the information services space, boasting over $4 billion in annual revenues, and has more than 15,000 employees around the globe. </span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #303030; font-size: 16px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Traditionally, they managed their IT infrastructure with multiple legacy systems, from a number of different vendors, and many homegrown tools. Faced with manual processes, disconnected systems and high costs, the company needed to transform the way it delivered IT services. That's why chose ServiceNow to deliver a comprehensive, 24x7 cloud-based management solution across 38 countries — setting an aggressive deployment target of just 9 months. To ensure a successful deployment, they engaged ServiceNow Global Services and our partner to get the job done.</span><img   alt="info-srvcs.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="284" src="2bb49c8edb145304b322f4621f9619c6.iix" style="width: 427px; height: 283.748px; float: right;" width="427"/></p><pre __jive_macro_name="quote" class="jive_macro_quote jive_text_macro" data-renderedposition="183_8_1192_224" modifiedtitle="true"><p></p><p style="margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #21199d; font-size: 18pt; font-family: Calibri;"><em>"Though the deployment of secure and effective technology, we have improved business performance and therefore enabled a superior customer experience."</em></span></p><p style="margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #505050; font-size: 14pt;">Vice President of Global Service Excellence</span></p><p></p></pre><p><span style="color: #303030; font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Earlier this year, they began a staggered go-live of 14 ServiceNow applications — including Service Mapping, Discovery, Vulnerability Response, Incident, Problem, Change, Knowledge Management, and HR Service Delivery.
