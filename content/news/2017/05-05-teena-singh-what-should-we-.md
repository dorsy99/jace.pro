The HI Online Customer and User Experience team manages, customizes and designs your experiences on HI. Our New Year's resolution was to gather as much customer feedback as possible in 2017 to understand how we can best deliver on this. Through your online customer feedback and meeting many of you at <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=1e295a2ddbd897c068c1fb651f9619ca" style="font-family: Arial;">local SNUGS</a>, we heard that you wanted to have a consistent, intuitive and seamless online customer experience. <em>Guess what?</em> We used your valuable customer feedback to make some changes to HI!</p><p></p><h1>Changes we made to HI so far</h1><p style="text-align: left;">Ta-da! You have probably noticed that we redesigned the navigation framework for the HI Service Portal. This new framework includes a more structured left navigational menu, improved homepage widgets for at-a-glance information on your open incidents/open change requests, and updated user menu options.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #303030;"><img   alt="HI home page .png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="f1d504c2db5c5fc068c1fb651f9619bc.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 538px;"/><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: #303030;">Homepage Charts coming soon.</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p><span style="color: #303030;">Additio<span style="font-size: 10pt;">nally, we have a new n</span>otification preferences page for Express and Enterprise customers, accessible from the user menu. On this new notification preferences page, you will have both visibility and flexibility to control your HI email notifications. <strong>Partners, don't fret, your notifications are coming soon!</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #303030;"><em><strong><img   alt="Notification Preferences_Screenshot_x1.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="c4190c86dbdc5fc068c1fb651f9619e4.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 538px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></strong></em></span></p><p style="margin-left: 64.0pt; text-indent: -64.0pt;"></p><h2><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #505050;">How these changes are consistent, intuitive and seamless (oh...and better performance, too!)</span></h2><p><span style="color: #303030; font-size: 10pt;">From our feedback and conversations with customers, we understood that it was important for you to have an experience on HI that matches how you currently interact with other ServiceNow products. Therefore, we provided you with a left navigation panel that is more consistent with that experience. Additionally, we highlighted key details (like the status of your incidents/changes) so you could intuitively navigate to information that is meaningful to you and your organization. We heard loud and clear you wanted greater awareness and control of your HI notifications - within the notification preferences page, you will have the ability to view, subscribe and unsubscribe from notifications. Finally, we <strong>improved performance</strong> using updated Service Portal code.</span></p><p></p><p>As we move forward, this redesign will enable the HI team to scale and expand the HI Service Portal as new functions and features emerge. We hope as you complete your critical tasks in HI that this new HI navigational framework is usable and enables you to be more productive and effective in your role.</p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #505050;">The future of HI in 2017</span></h2><p>The HI team is customer focused.
