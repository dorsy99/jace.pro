<p style="text-align: left;">The <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/security-incident-response/reference/sir-landing-page.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/security-incident-response/reference/sir-landing-page.html">Security Incident Response</a> application has been a big hit since it was introduced in the Geneva release. (See the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/security-risk/blog/2015/11/12/introducing-the-new-security-incident-response-application">blog post </a>I wrote for more details!) Since then, our development team has been working hard to expand our offerings within the world of <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/planning-and-policy/concept/c_SecurityManagement.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/planning-and-policy/concept/c_SecurityManagement.html">Security Operations</a> and provide the functionality that our customers have requested, including <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/vulnerability-response/reference/vuln-landing-page.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/vulnerability-response/reference/vuln-landing-page.html">Vulnerability Response</a> and <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/threat-intelligence/reference/threat-intel-landing-page.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/threat-intelligence/reference/threat-intel-landing-page.html">Threat Intelligence</a>. In the Jakarta release, we are pleased to offer the new <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/trusted-circles/reference/trusted-circles-landing-page.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/trusted-circles/reference/trusted-circles-landing-page.html">Trusted Security Circles</a> application.</p><p></p><h2>Don't suffer through security attacks alone</h2><p><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/trusted-circles/concept/trusted-circles.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/trusted-circles/concept/trusted-circles.html">Trusted Security Circles</a> enables you to anonymously share information about security issues with people you trust. This is a big deal. Companies and organizations in all different types of industries face serious security threats. For starters, think about attacks on governments, financial companies, healthcare organizations, and airlines. Companies have traditionally handled security attacks on their own because nobody wants to admit they are facing or suffered an attack. That is bad for business, reputation, brand, and stock price. Case in point - the folks at Yahoo, LinkedIn, Target, Sony, NARA, and Anthem sure would like you to forget about the large security breaches they experienced in recent years.</p><p></p><p>Rich Reybok, head of engineering for Security Operations here at ServiceNow, describes Trusted Security Circles in a succinct way. Rich says that the bad guys are collaborating and that Trusted Security Circles allows the good guys to safely collaborate and not face threats alone. If I am a security analyst and I have a whole community of like-minded people sharing information with me, I can simply identify and address attacks faster.</p><p></p><p>Here is an overview of how the Trusted Security Circles application works using a central, cloud-based instance to anonymously link senders and recipients that are sharing information.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="trusted-circles-eco.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="cd3dc08adb509fc03eb27a9e0f961969.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 222px;"/></p><p></p><h2>Getting started with Trusted Security Circles</h2><p>When you <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/trusted-circles/task/activate-trusted-circles.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-security-management/page/product/trusted-circles/task/activate-trusted-circles.html">activate the Trusted Security Circles plugin</a>, a profile named "anonymous" is created automatically. Your profile is a representation of how other members of the circles you join see your Trusted Security Circles instance. You have control over your profile and can edit the settings at any time. You can also create multiple profiles with different settings.</p><p></p><p>Next, determine the people that you want to share security information with. What is your company, your industry, your specific vulnerabilities, or the geographic locations in which you are interested? Maybe you are a bank in London and you want to collaborate with other financial organizations in Europe. Alternatively, you could be a movie studio in California and want to see threats against others in the entertainment industry around the world.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="join-circle.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="b5caa3bddb581fc03eb27a9e0f961905.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 203px;"/></p><p></p><p>After joining one or multiple circles, you'll really see the value of Trusted Security Circles. Within the circles, you can see the indicators of an attack, such as IP addresses and the URLs used to deliver attack payloads. If you see that others in the circle are experiencing an attack, you can search for those indicators on your systems and see if the same attack is happening to you. The sharing is bi-directional, so as you learn about the attack and tackle it, you are providing more information to the circle. Another neat feature is that a security incident can be automatically opened in ServiceNow Security Operations if the number of sightings hits a certain threshold. This all helps the good guys win! And, remember, all of this sharing is happening anonymously.</p><p></p><h3>Additional information about the Trusted Security Circles application</h3><p>This is just a brief introduction to Trusted Security Circles.
