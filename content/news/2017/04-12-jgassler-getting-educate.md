My start in IT wasn't in ServiceNow, but in the mobile solutions practice. But one thing to note about the mobile industry is it isn't <em>purely</em> mobile. It's more productivity and improving efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Typically, anyone looking for a mobile app is looking for a way to improve their efficiency. We were trying to see how we could automate a lot of the steps that a   mobile app connects to on the backend — things like APIs, which programs the app will hand information off to, and the like — so that holistically if you want to do something good productivity-wise, it will not be limited just mobile component itself. There needs to be a backend to automate a lot of processes, workflows that run smoothly, information that's aggregated all into one place and not having to hand over that information to several different systems. The ServiceNow platform fits perfectly into all of this as it can be the platform that can act as centralized automation engine, and that's how I got started with it.</p><p></p><p>Last year was my first year attending Knowledge. We were just starting to get into ServiceNow and came in with a lot of assumptions about the tool, how people were using it, who the main people who used it were, and so on. Attending the conference validated these assumptions. On top of these validations, as a customer we were exposed to many new features as well as how others are solving the same problems that we have operationally and how best to implement ServiceNow to resolve those issues not just as a tool but as a platform. The icing on the cake was being able to listen in on some of the keynotes, especially some that focused on ServiceNow's strategic direction going forward.</p><p></p><p>This year we really want to let our offerings shine and learn as much from the conference as we can. We specialize in third party integrations, custom apps, CMS-based dashboards, and reporting along with standard ITOM and ITSM implementations. Some of the special, more advanced skillsets that we worked last year are custom mobile integrations and chatbots for the ServiceNow platform.   Come see us at booth 613 to learn more about what we offer and try your hand at mini golf!
