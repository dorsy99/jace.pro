<p> <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi all,</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">We're looking for some companies interested in helping beta test the integration between our asset discovery tool and   the ServiceNow CMDB. Our agentless discovery tool finds a large number of asset types (i.e. servers, network, applications, web sites, endpoints) and device attributes out of the box and there are user-customizable probes to find even more. It pulls asset info from cloud providers and there's also a Windows agent for real-time monitoring of server config changes or endpoint tracking over the Internet. Too many features to list.   The tool has successfully discovered customer environments of all sizes, including thousands of servers and supporting infrastructure.   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Anyway, now we want to test the integration with ServiceNow with real-world deployments. Lots of perks for those who participate so drop me a note if you're interested.   </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Thanks in advance,</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Keith</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:Kfinger@virima.com">Kfinger@virima.com</a><span> </span></span></p>
