<p>ServiceNow is the center of many organization's IT Service Management and fast becoming the center of all of Service Management. This means a huge amount of data gets created and sent into ServiceNow. This data is vital to the understanding of an organization's processes, trends in operations, business services, and customer success. Tableau is a tool used to analyze this sort of data and provide reports back to the leadership. Too many times the data provided to Tableau is limited and dated, because extracting the data from ServiceNow can take time and have an element of complexity.</p><p><strong>Perspectium Replicator provides a native UI in ServiceNow that allows the customer to share any table in ServiceNow to a database automatically creating the data schema in the database in real time.</strong></p><p><img  alt="Screen Shot 2017-04-29 at 7.37.42 AM.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="dcc40842dbd41344e9737a9e0f9619ed.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 303px;"/></p><p>There is no need to write code, manually setup the database, and wait for the data to get updated.</p><p></p><p><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Native Application in ServiceNow.</strong></p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2017-04-29 at 7.34.07 AM.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="27b264cedb10dfc068c1fb651f9619de.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 371px;"/></p>
