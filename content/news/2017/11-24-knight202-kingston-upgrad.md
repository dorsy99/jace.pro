<p>Community!</p><p></p><p>Ran across the link to the Kingston Upgrade Planning Checklist within the Release Notes. It was tucked-away at the bottom of the page, so, I thought it might be a good idea to post the link. From experience, I've seen several man-hours consumed creating custom checklists. Hopefully, this will reduce the time and amount of resources required to upgrade!</p><p></p><p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/upgrades/upgrades-planning-checklist.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/upgrades/upgrades-planning-checklist.html">Upgrade planning checklist (Kingston)</a> </p>
