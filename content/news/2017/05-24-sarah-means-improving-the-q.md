<p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">With K17 behind us, it was great to see the level of interest and engagement we had from both prospects and existing customers on leveraging the HR application. Some of the savings in both cost and productivity has been amazing. It got me thinking, for customers already using HR, what else can they use to continue to bring value?</p><p></p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">One thing that came to mind is a ServiceNow platform application called Coaching loops. Now I imagine, many of you haven't even heard of this application - but the great thing is its one of our platform features and is should be available in your environments for no extra cost. A great opportunity to expand your HR footprint within the environment, while getting some value out.</p><p></p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">First, let me explain what Coaching Loops does. The application was built to assist managers or supervisors of any department to provide coaching opportunities to their service center agents geared toward improving the quality of work that is being done. This gives managers the ability to stay in close contact with new agents or anyone that may be on a probationary period to be sure they get the assistance they need to better themselves and in turn improve employee satisfaction.</p><p></p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Lets explore an example use case to illustrate some of the functionality in Coaching Loops; A benefits supervisor can use coaching loops to help a new member of their team get up and running fast while providing feedback on their performance. Lets say this person is not only a new member to the team, but fairly new into the HR workforce so we want to be sure we review all the cases they work on for their first two weeks. Notifications are sent when a case is competed to the supervisor, and they are able to see exactly transpired between their new agent and the employee they were supporting by using a case snapshot. This can include things like: what emails were exchanged back and forth? Did they use the knowledge base, if so did they send this employee the correct articles based off their plan, location etc? Did they follow the fulfillment instructions appropriately? Did they escalate as needed?</p><p></p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Supervisors can use this to provide constructive feedback on how they can improve their performance so next time the agent can provide better support for a great experience. They can also make notes internally to the management team so they have a full record of this employees coaching history and improvements over time. See photo below for an example of a supervisors view and recorded notes.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Screen Shot 2017-05-22 at 12.43.00 PM.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7323e182db50d7049c9ffb651f961914.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 315px;"/></p><p></p><p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">To enable this functionality all you need to do is turn on the Coaching Loops plugin if its not on already. Please check out the documentation site for additional setup information.</p>
