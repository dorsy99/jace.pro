<p>Disclaimer: <em>This is not MY tip. It was provided to me a while back by the Performance Analytics development team.</em></p><p></p><p>I am occasionally asked about using condition logic in a formula indicator, so here is the structure of using IF logic in a Performance Analytics formula indicator.</p><p></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a simple example but should give enough information to work with.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Structure: Â  &lt;EVALUALTION&gt; ? &lt;OUTCOME IF TRUE&gt; : &lt;OUTCOME IF FALSE&gt;</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Example: Let's say I want to know the average length of time it takes to review implemented changes. One challenge, however, is that if the denominator of a formula is 0, it will calculate as a null value in the scores. A way to work around that is to include a condition in the formula. In this example, when the number of implemented changes = 0, I want the entire formula to evaluate to 0 instead of null.</span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">[[Number of implemented changes]] == 0 ? 0 : [[Summed duration of change review period for implemented changes]]</span><span class="s1"> / [[Number of implemented changes]]</span></p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the example, each item inside of the [[ ]] is a defined indicator. It could be an automated indicator, a manual indicator, or another formula indicator.</span></p>
