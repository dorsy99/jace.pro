This article will address those benefits, using ServiceNow, the leading HR Service Delivery case management &amp; knowledge management platform as an example.   </p><p></p><p>First, an analogy.   If you store your knowledge in a system that is separate from your case management system, it's like going to your neighbor's house for water every time you want to have a drink, wash dishes, or shower. This is the equivalent to what we call "swivel-chairing" when you have to navigate between two separate systems to complete a job.   Wouldn't it be easier and faster to just turn on the faucet in your own home?</p><p></p><p>Number one:   By using one system for case and knowledge, HR agents have knowledge results directly in the case at their finger tips for faster resolution and a better employee service experience.   HR Agents are able to view their own <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unfiltered</span> Knowledge embedded in the case form, with the option to attach relevant knowledge, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personalized</span> and filtered for the employee's profile so it's correct, with one click.   </p><p></p><p>Secondly, Knowledge content is available for the agent to speed case resolution in a Chat interface too, which can be shared with the employee via a drag-and-drop interface. Feedback loops are built in with the ability to create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">draft</span> knowledge content from cases or chat conversations.   So when the HR agent detects a trend (e.g. this is the fourth question about our new benefit I've answer this week), they can become of part of improving the experience for the employees.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="Screen Shot 2017-03-14 at 7.59.31 AM.JPG" class="image-2 jive-image" src="743ddc8adbdc17041dcaf3231f96199a.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 365px;"/></p><p></p><p>Third, agents can see a history of the employee's knowledge viewing directly in the case, so the agent has more insight and context with which to provide better service to the employee.   "Oh, I understand you have a question about reading your pay stub, but I can see you've never read our article that explains how to do that.   Let's start by me sending that to you."</p><p></p><p>Fourth, an employee can create a case directly from a knowledge article, which also tells the agent what article the employee was looking at when he or she generated the case. This context and insight also allows the agent to provide faster, better service to the employee.   It's like having a crystal ball.</p><p></p><p>Finally, ServiceNow allows you the option to embed fulfillment instructions, in the form of a knowledge article, directly within the case.   So for specific types of cases, HR agents have all the information they need right in front of them to help complete the transaction correctly, accurately, and fast without having to swivel-chair into another system to get directions or answers.   That is a good service experience.   </p><p></p><p>I hope this will help you make your decision by describing the advantages of housing your case and knowledge management in a single platform.   I have included a summary below.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="Screen Shot 2017-03-14 at 7.53.40 AM.JPG" class="image-3 jive-image" src="ac1bbfb5db90db048c8ef4621f9619cf.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 273px;"/></p>
