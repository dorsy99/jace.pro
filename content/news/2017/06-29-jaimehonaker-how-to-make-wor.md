<p>Currently, when viewing a ticket, the <strong>Additional Comments</strong> field is the default, which is customer-facing. But what if you want to specify what your employees see first and limit what customers might accidentally see? Fortunately, changing the default view of Additional Comments to internal-facing <strong><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/state-flows/concept/c_WorkNotes.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/state-flows/concept/c_WorkNotes.html">Work Notes</a></strong> is easier than you think.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="paperman1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="721e914edbd8130468c1fb651f9619ff.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;">Wait, what?</p><p></p><p>Yes, you heard that right. When you are viewing a ticket, you are able to make <strong>Work Notes</strong> the default view, instead of the (customer-visible) <strong>Additional Comments</strong>. While the yellow indicator is a cue to let employees know they are posting public vs private notes, setting up the <strong>Work Notes</strong> as default is another way to prevent fellow employees (barring human error) from posting employee-intended information in the customer-visible <strong>Additional Comments</strong> field by mistake.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: left;"><img   alt="work notes default view.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="22ab9006db1c9fc068c1fb651f9619aa.iix" style="max-width: 620px; height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>There are actually two user preferences to help make the Work Notes and the Additional Comments a single field: expand them to show both, or default to Work Notes.</p><p></p><p>From sys_user_preferences:</p><ol><li>Remove the user name</li><li>Change the System field to true (checked)</li><li>Insert and save the new record</li></ol><p><img   alt="work notes.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="23797c4edbd89344e9737a9e0f9619a7.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 62px;"/></p><p></p><p>That's easy, right?</p><p></p><p>You can also set this up as the default for users. Keep in mind, this does not prevent users from changing it back the way they prefer it or want to see it - for example, if a user prefers a collapsed view and comments first.</p><p></p><p>Another thing to note is that this does not automatically change all tables. Since there is an <strong>incident </strong>in the preference name, adjust this setting for each table (change_request, problem, etc.) where the combination field occurs.</p><p></p><p>Looking for the original post?
