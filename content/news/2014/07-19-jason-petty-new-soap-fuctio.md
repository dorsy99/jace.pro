<p>I was on a call with a customer the other day showing them how to use the SOAP Message object as a SOAP client to test their connection.   When I had to make 20 parameters manually I started thinking of what a pain it was right there on the WebEx to have to do this.   I created this tool to allow me to quickly click a button and just have it make them for me.   What a time saver!</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Here is the link to the tool out on <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/ef4008302b4225004a1e976be8da1563/overview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Share</a></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Enjoy.</p>
