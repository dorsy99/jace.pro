<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Hi everyone!</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">My name is Jonas í…kerman and I have the honor to be the new leader of the Swedish SNUG. I work at the partner Advania and we are at the moment also implementing ServiceNow, so soon we will also be users by definition. But I would like to point out that this is a forum for all you users and that I as a partner will only facilitate the User Group as long as I have your full trust and support. And that also goes for you other partners out there who I know also contribute to making the User Group valuable for all ServiceNow users.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">I have been in the IT business for twenty years and have been working mainly with ITSM for the latest ten. Since we only have been working with ServiceNow since 2009, I have most of my experince from working with other vendors. And that's where I also have some experince from managing a very successful User Group.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">I am really looking forward to meeting you all at the next meeting and to get the opportunity do discuss with you on how we together can bring as much value as possible from the User Group and the meetings.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">See you soon!</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Jonas í…kerman</span></p><p><span style="mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: SV; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Business Developer at Advania</span></p>
