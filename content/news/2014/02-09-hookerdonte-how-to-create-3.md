<p>In playing with containers I was able to accomplish having 3 variables on 1 line. To create this you must create two containers. For the first container(with 2 alternating sides), make sure your first variable is after the first container start. Immediately following the first variable create the second container start (with 2 alternating sides). Then place the two remaining variables you want on the same line after the second container start. Finally, create 2 container end variables and you are complete. See example below.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="" class="image-0 jiveImage" src="28b2ab71db9c9f04e9737a9e0f961911.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p><img  alt="" class="image-2 jiveImage" src="c07ac54adb90d304b322f4621f9619ff.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p>
