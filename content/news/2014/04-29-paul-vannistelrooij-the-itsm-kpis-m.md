But as I showed in my previous </span><a _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/blog/2014/04/24/lagging-performance-leading-indicators"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">post</span></a><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">, it is not always straightforward to understand which indicators will give you the insight you're looking for in order to run IT.
