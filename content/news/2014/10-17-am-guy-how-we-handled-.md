<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Expectations</strong></p><p>This is not a general BCC Solution.   It is a very targeted solution used in a specific circumstance.</p><p></p><p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</strong></p><p>We had a requirement where we needed Service-Now to deal with BCC emails from one email address and the email be routed a certain way.   The emails were confidential in nature and so had to be handled properly.</p><p></p><p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Environment</strong></p><p>We use Exchange and setup email in-boxes to forward to Service-Now.   Our Service-Now rules process the email, usually based on the recipients field.</p><p></p><p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Issue</strong></p><p>When we BCC the email address in question, Service-Now has no way of knowing the email address because BCC information is not included in the recipients.   Therefore we don't have a way of knowing the email was sent to this address.</p><p></p><p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Solution</strong></p><p>We changed the forward rule on the email inbox to be an inbox rule as opposed to our normal back-end forward.   When the email is received in Service-Now, we look in the header for "<em><span>Resent-From: &lt;</span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:address@company.com">address@company.com</a><span>&gt;"</span></em>.</p><p></p><p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional problems caused by this setup</strong></p><p>If we send an email to two addresses that forward to Service-Now, Service-Now still receives only 1 email.   Because we changed the forward on this one particular inbox to an inbound rule, Service-Now started receiving two emails and processing two tickets.   See examples below.</p><p></p><p><em>Normal Example</em></p><p><span>Assume I email </span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:test1@company.com">test1@company.com</a><span> and CC </span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:test2@company.com">test2@company.com</a><span> and both forward to Service-Now.   Service-Now logs one email and will create 1 ticket according to the inbound email actions.</span></p><p></p><p><em>Our BCC Example</em></p><p><span>Assume I email </span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:test1@company.com">test1@company.com</a><span> and CC </span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:test2@company.com">test2@company.com</a><span> and </span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:test2@company.com">test2@company.com</a><span> has the email forward setup as an inbox rule instead.   Service-Now logs two emails and needs to be setup correctly to handle the emails.</span></p>
