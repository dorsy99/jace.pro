Despite numerous efforts to address this over the last decade, organizations continue to spend the majority of their time on activities that don't contribute to innovation. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 0.25in;">In this session, you'll learn how Mike Carraway and the IT organization at Red Hat have worked to shift IT priorities and focus on innovation in the following ways:</span></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Stop playing defense and falling into reactive mode. With every major technology shift, we make this play — and lose.</li><li>Stop spending time on administrative tasks that, although meant to address the issue, actually make it worse.</li><li>Get serious about automation - really, this time.</li><li>Embrace the self-service opportunities that come from cloud capabilities, consumer tools, and the BYOD movement.</li><li>Build the skills and credibility required to play — and stay — in the "innovation" space.</li></ol><p></p><p>See you there!</p><p></p><p><strong>Connect with us &amp; stay informed! </strong></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Follow <a title="witter.com/servicenow" href="https://twitter.com/servicenow">@ServiceNow</a> on Twitter</li><li>Chat using the <a title="witter.com/hashtag/gartnersym" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gartnersym">#GartnerSYM</a> and <a title="witter.com/hashtag/servicenow" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/servicenow">#ServiceNow</a> hashtags</li><li>Post a <a title="witter.com/hashtag/servicenowselfie" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/servicenowselfie">#ServiceNowSelfie</a> when you visit the booth — you might just make the <a title="ww.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152557514047573.1073741839.70876467572&type=3" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152557514047573.1073741839.70876467572&amp;type=3">Facebook album</a>!</li></ul>
