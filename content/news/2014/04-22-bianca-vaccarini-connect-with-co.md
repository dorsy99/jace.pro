<p>During Knowledge14 you are going to be doing a lot of chatting, collaborating, and networking. I expect everyone to come prepared with a stack of business cards to pass out and be ready to leave the conference with a wealth of knowledge and ton of new friends.</p><p></p><p>The best way to connect with your new-found Knowledge14 network is to do a community search. So take out that stack of business cards you received at Knowledge14 and let's start connecting with community members that attended Knowledge14.</p><p></p><h2>How you can search for your new Knowledge14 friends and connect with them:</h2><p></p><h3>1. Search the community</h3><p>Using the community-wide search bar, located in the top left corner of every community page, you can find people using key words such as their first name, last name, company or location.</p><p></p><ol><li>Navigate to the search bar in the top-right corner of the community</li><li>Type in your search word (first name, last name, company etc.)</li><li>Wait for the list to populate with relative threads, people and content</li><li>If you do not see the person you are looking for, Click the "Show_ more," "See all people results," and "See all place results"</li></ol><p></p><p>For example, I used <a title="Lawrence Eng" __default_attr="3372" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro_user jive_macro" data-orig-content="Lawrence Eng" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=5c009ae1db581fc09c9ffb651f961975">Lawrence Eng</a> in the search to show you what information you can get by searching first names, last names or key words on the community.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="search by name.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="b07d9546db5cd344e9737a9e0f9619eb.iix" style="height: 430px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h3>2. Search <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/people">people on the community</a></h3><p>The difference between searching the community and searching <em>people</em> on the community is that it is a more specific search. Where in the example above, the search bar gives you Content, People, and Places, searching just the people on the community will only give you community registered users.</p><p></p><ol><li>Click on <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/people">People</a> in the top-right corner, in between Browse: and Places</li><li>In the drop down menu in the top navigation bar of the People page, select what factor to sort by. The options are: relevance, first name, last name, newest joined, and oldest joined.</li></ol><p><img   alt="servicenow community search people.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="e5a9f446db101b04ed6af3231f96190c.iix" style="height: 344px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><ol><li>Add text to filter by, this will include key words like the ones mentioned in point 2. This includes keywords like first names, last names, company etc.</li><li>You also have the option of adding an additional filter. You can sort your text filter by other properties such as tag, title and location.</li></ol><p><img   alt="servicenow community filter people by.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="8aba10cedb185304b322f4621f961939.iix" style="height: 351px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>No matter which way you go about finding your new network, I am sure you will find something useful on the ServiceNow community. Make an impression by<a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/edit-profile!input.jspa?targetUser="> filling out your profile</a> before you start connecting. It's always good to put a face to a name, especially when reconnecting with people online that you met in person.</p>
