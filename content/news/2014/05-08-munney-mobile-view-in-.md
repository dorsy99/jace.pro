<p>I thought this might be useful for someone developing their mobile interface.</p><p></p><p>Rather than testing everything on a mobile device you can add a /$m at the end of your instance URL in your desktop browser.</p><p></p><p>e.g. your-instance.service-now.com/navpage.do/$m                   ***note make sure to place the /$m after the /navpage.do***</p><p></p><p>Cheers!</p>
