<p>Hello,</p><p></p><p>I wanted to share this great On-Call Application developed by Drew West at Henry Ford Health System.</p><p></p><p><strong>Here's the Description:</strong></p><p></p><p>"This is an On-call application we built for scheduling On-call resources.   It was very important to us to know who to call and what there phone numbers are and who to escalate to if the resource did not answer.   So we built out this application.   A few of its features are: - Groups to assign schedulers that update and maintain On-call schedules for the group. - On-call resources can update and maintain contact phone numbers - Service Desk can simply click to see the phone number information for a groups On-call resources and management escalations for the group the ticket is assigned to. - Managers and Schedulers can maintain a Groups On-call information on there own - The system shows an On-call resource an icon when they are on-call that when clicked will allow them to see what groups they are on-call for along with links to update there information."</p><p></p><p>For your convenience here's the link to download the application:   <a href="https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detail/1ebece1e870355008bf84b0b0e434d07" title="https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detail/1ebece1e870355008bf84b0b0e434d07">ServiceNow Share</a></p><p></p><p>I have also attached a pdf file that describes the capabilities with screen shots, also available from the ShareNow site.</p><p></p><p>Thanks,</p><p></p><p>Dave</p>
