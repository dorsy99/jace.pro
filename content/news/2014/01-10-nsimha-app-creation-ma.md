<p>There are so many new   features to support custom application creation in in Dublin to get excited about.   I am going to highlight the top three</p><ul><li><strong>Team Development</strong> — This is the first native, distributed version control system natively built into the platform.   There is no need to integrate with any external source code control system. This new feature, which works alongside the update set framework, radically simplifies how a team of developers can work together to build a new application, work on patches to an application while working on the next release and supporting the dev-&gt;test-&gt;prod cycle.</li><li><strong>Javascript Debugger</strong> — Dublin bring rich IDE type debugging experience to your browser. With the Javascript debugger you can   set breakpoints, inspect variables and more for server side Javascript all from your browser.</li><li><strong>Enhanced App Creator </strong> — Calgary introduced AppCreator that made creating an application a breeze.       Dublin enhances it further — turn on   live feed on any table with a single click, create a service catalog entry for any table by configuring the fields you want.</li></ul><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Get started by watching these video on   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0IURiCvvWY"><span style="color: #0000ff;">team development</span></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4XrTxjBEsQ"><span style="color: #0000ff;">debugger</span></a>. </strong></p><p></p><p>Finally, be sure to check out the <strong><a href="https://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Dublin_Release_Notes"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dublin Release Notes</span></a></strong> for all the other exciting new features!</p>
