<h3>Unprecedented level of integration between ServiceNow and Nagios plugins</h3><p></p><p>What if you could run nagios plugins, manage their thresholds, view metric graphs, and send alerts directly from ServiceNow? This would totally eliminate the need for a separate console, and all your Nagios data would reside alongside your ITSM data.</p><p></p><p>Well, you can. With the latest release of the Evanios Monitoring solution, you can now run any Nagios plugin from the Evanios Agent and manage the configuration all from ServiceNow. All you have to do is to copy the plugins to the targeted server or the Evanios Agent server, then use our ServiceNow application to configure and manage it. Configuring a plugin to run from ServiceNow is extremely easy, no coding is required.</p><p></p><p>You can even capture the result of the script and set metrics value based on that result. For example, if a plug-in returns "<em>Processor Time = 20.84%</em>", you could create a metric called "utilization" and have the value be the utilization value (in the case above 20.84%).</p><p></p><p>Run as many Nagios plugins as you want, whether it's a plugin that will collect the local CPU utilization or a plug-in that will monitor an Oracle database remotely.   Monitor basically anything, and choose from over <a title="change.nagios.org/directory/Plugins" href="http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins">4000 Nagios plugins available.</a></p><p></p><h3>Why would I want to run Nagios plugins from Servicenow?</h3><p></p><p><strong>1. Central configuration. </strong>Configure thresholds, alert settings, scheduling, and where each plugin will run directly from ServiceNow. This provides an unprecedented level integration with other ServiceNow applications.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.evanios.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nagios-alert.jpg"><img alt="nagios-alert" class="size-full alignnone jiveImage wp-image-1199" height="264" src="http://www.evanios.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nagios-alert.jpg" width="631"/></a></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>2.
