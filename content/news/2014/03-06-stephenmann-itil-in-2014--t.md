<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The annual Pink Elephant conference was a busy time for AXELOS. Not only did it announce <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.axelos.com/?DI=639593" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new staff</a> and a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.axelos.com/?DI=639512" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new cybersecurity offering</a>, AXELOS also ran two sessions: one on the ITIL* roadmap and another about how they have been engaging with the IT service management (ITSM) community on the future of ITIL.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">This blog concentrates on the latter. Or, more specifically, the results of a community-based survey undertaken late last year. I offer a selection of the results below, the full survey will be issued by AXELOS is due course. **</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Awareness of ITIL</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Firstly, the similarities and differences across geographies are interesting. The circa 10% of respondents who have heard of ITIL but not studies it ** is nigh on uniform across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. As is the circa 40% that, while they have studied ITIL, have yet to gain any certifications, interestingly bar North America which is at a lowly 20%. A reflection on the importance of certification in North America?</p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2866-8465/Ax1.png"><img  alt="Ax1.png" class="jive-image image-2" height="341" src="7a9e80cadb5417049c9ffb651f9619c0.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="377"/></a> AXELOS considers North America to be its largest market for ITIL which is reflected in the percentage of respondents that have achieved ITIL certifications. Albeit with the smallest number of post-Foundation certifications. We could speculate as to why this is but that would be purely speculation — for instance we could jump to the conclusion that Foundation level is seen as good enough, but it requires further analysis as to why people in North America aren't moving forward with harder-to-get certifications (other than the fact that they are harder to get of course).</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>The value of ITIL by role</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The survey also looked at the perceived value of ITIL, which is pretty consistent across roles. That it is valuable to IT organizations. What is most interesting though is the C-level enthusiasm relative to other IT roles.</p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2866-8466/Ax2.png"><img  alt="Ax2.png" class="jive-image image-3" height="341" src="7c77e7b9dbd41fc03eb27a9e0f9619bd.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="417"/></a>Again we could speculate as to the reason(s) — that the most senior of IT management have inflated expectations as to the potential of ITIL or that lower-level staff have been worn down by the trials and tribulations of adopting ITIL beyond incident, problem, and change. Or maybe even the upheaval from a decade or more of changing ITSM tools in the pursuance of improved operational performance and greater ITIL adoption has caused discontent with what is ultimately a best practice framework not a miracle cure.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Some might consider it evidence that C-levels are somewhat divorced from operational reality or that they are blissfully unaware of the difficulties of adopting the less common ITIL processes (beyond incident, problem, and change). But again it requires further analysis for us to be certain.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>ITIL's continued importance in light of cloud and agile</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">As with the previous data set, there is a consensus about the value of ITIL going forward. And again the C-level and similar roles have the greatest expectations of, and faith in, ITIL. With other IT roles twice as pessimistic in choosing the "ITIL is not valuable or is marginally valuable" and "ITIL is somewhat valuable" options. But 62%, so nearly two-thirds, of lower-level roles still see ITIL as very or exceedingly valuable for future IT operations.</p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2866-8467/Ax3.png"><img  alt="Ax3.png" class="jive-image image-4" height="341" src="58a3958edb10d7041dcaf3231f9619ab.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="418"/></a>The reason(s)? I can only give you my personal opinion. It's similar to the previous speculation but this time I think we need to look at the multi-dimensionality of this. That there is the suitability of a best practice framework to help, and then there is the ability of people to use that best practice in anger. Having the fastest car in Formula 1 doesn't mean that you will be world champion, but it has to help.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">But there are other dimensions too: how ITIL has been sold to organizations and individuals (as the proverbial silver bullet) and whether people understand its power and limitations (and possibly the time and money that needs to be invested beyond the certifications). Successful ITIL adoption is about so much more than exam certificates and, dare I say it, having the best ITSM tool(s). Sadly we come back to that age-old chestnut of people, culture, capabilities, mindsets, performance measurement, and the like.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>In summary</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Firstly, good on AXELOS for living up to its promise of taking a global approach to the future of ITIL. You might have also seen them on the road as they appear at the majority, if not all, of the annual itSMF chapter conferences.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Secondly it's great that ITIL is still seen as valuable to IT professionals. Albeit with a disconnect between the opinions of top management and other IT roles that needs to be addressed as part of reselling ITIL with a greater foothold in reality rather than as the previously too prevalent miracle cure to all of IT's ITSM woes.</p><p align="center" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em>Well that's as far as this blog goes.
