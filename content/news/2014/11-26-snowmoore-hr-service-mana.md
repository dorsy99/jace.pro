Topics within Core would include: security/access (Users, Role/Groups); and Service Catalog.</li><li><strong>Definitive Data (w/ possible Integration)</strong> — I purposely separate data elements such as Personnel (i.e. Employees), Organizational Departments (i.e. Cost Center); and Geographical Locations. While the data is important and can be classified as 'core,' the source of the data is critical. As an example, it is common for HRSM systems to be directed to pull data from existing Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) which SAP, Oracle, Workday, and even legacy mainframes are examples. The take away here is to determine where the definitive data resides and plan to establish rules for consumption by the HRSM and updates by the HRSM (if it is even allowed).</li><li><strong>Knowledge</strong> — "Knowledge, Knowledge, Knowledge!" This cannot be stressed enough with the HR Service Management deployment. A successful HR Department will focus upon release articles and information that will increase Level 0 (Self-Help) resolution stats to free up HR Personnel to manage the knowledge and focus upon organizational improvement.</li><li><strong>Service Catalog Forms</strong> — As mentioned above<ins cite="mailto:Noel%20Talluto" datetime="2014-11-13T16:41">,</ins> specific data will need to be captured depending upon the specific forms that would be deployed.

The original plan was to tear down the massive structure in 1909 (once the twenty year ownership contract of Gustave Eiffel expired).   However, the Paris Government realized the value of the structure and decided to keep it.<a href="file:///C:/Fru%20Business/EVENTS%20AND%20CONCEPTS/2014_10_xx_ServiceNowBlog_HR%20(IN%20PROGRESS)/2014_10_xx_HR_Blog_5_v1.0/2014_11_xx_HR_Blog_5_v1.2.docx#_ftn5" title=""><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">[5]</span></a> The same holds true with planning and executing a proper Human Resource Service Management (HRSM) solution.
