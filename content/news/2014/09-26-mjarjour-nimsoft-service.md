<p>Nimsoft is one of the most popular monitoring tool with a very large install base.   It has a large variety of monitoring plug-ins available (VM, Physical, Applications...). Although it may lack some bells and whistles, by pairing it with a solid Event Management solution it can be very effective.</p><p></p><p>The Nimsoft Event Integration for Evanios Operations and Integrations allows Nimsoft to send events to ServiceNow. Once in ServiceNow the events can be deduplicated, changed, correlated, analyzed, enriched ... and used to trigger meaningful incidents or corrective automation.</p><p></p><p>The integration architecture is relatively simple. Nimsoft can run a script (when an alarm occurs) through it's Nimsoft Alarm Server (NAS) which is a service probe at Nimsoft infrastructure. Evanios provides a Lua script that will be called by Nimsoft. This Lua script will package up script variables, and submit the event in a defined format to the Evanios command line client, which will handle submission to Evanios Operations or Integrations.</p><p></p><p>With the out of the box integration, the following Nimsoft fields will get mapped automatically to ServiceNow:</p><p></p><p><img   alt="NimsoftFields.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="3df52942db501744e9737a9e0f96193d.iix" style="height: 452px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p>For more information on how the integration works, and to learn how to set it up, see our<a title="w.evanios.com/mwiki/index.php?title=CA_Nimsoft_Packaged_Integration" href="http://www.evanios.com/mwiki/index.php?title=CA_Nimsoft_Packaged_Integration"> integration documentation wiki</a>.</p><p></p><h3>Why integrate Nimsoft to ServiceNow <strong>through</strong> Evanios?</h3><p></p><p>Evanios Operations is an event and operations management solution that runs directly on the ServiceNow. It acts as a "manager of managers", collecting event data from all monitoring solutions. Evanios Integrations provides a framework for rapid integration of enterprise events into ServiceNow Incident Management or the new ServiceNow Event Management application released with Eureka.</p><p></p><p>By putting an Event Management layer between the monitoring systems and ServiceNow's incident application, it provides an effective way to eliminate the creation of bogus tickets in the service desk, and create smarter, more meaningful incidents. There are lots of other reasons to implement Event Management — the Event Management process <a href="https://www.ucisa.ac.uk/%7E/media/Files/members/activities/ITIL/service_operation/ITIL_Introducing%20Service%20Operation%20pdf.ashx" title="ITIL Service Operation Intro">defined in ITIL v3 Service Operation is a good read</a>. </p><p></p><p>Here are some information that can jump start your Nimsoft integration with ServiceNow:</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.evanios.com/site/evanios-operations/" title="Evanios Operations">Get more information on Evanios Operations</a> (and see a quick demo)</p><p><a href="http://www.evanios.com/site/download-evanios-operations/" title="Download Evanios Operations">Download and deploy Evanios Operations now</a></p><p><a title="w.evanios.com/site/downloads/" href="http://www.evanios.com/site/downloads/">Download the Nimsoft Event Integration for Evanios Operations</a></p><p><a title="w.evanios.com/mwiki/index.php?title=CA_Nimsoft_Packaged_Integration" href="http://www.evanios.com/mwiki/index.php?title=CA_Nimsoft_Packaged_Integration">Read the documentation</a></p>
