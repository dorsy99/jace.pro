<p class="p1">Marc Andreessen, internet wunderkind of Netscape fame who deserves credit for making web geekery cool, <a title="line.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460" href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">famously claimed</a> in 2011 that <em>"software is eating the world."</em> He cited that in a decade, the cost of delivering internet-scale web services has decreased two orders of magnitude and continues to fall.</p><p class="p1"></p><p><img   alt="andreessen.jpeg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="e76a814adb941b04ed6af3231f961941.iix" style="height: auto; float: right;"/></p><div> </div><p class="p1">The future of technology - no, the future of globalization - is now controlled by a small number of application creators. They define <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">the architectures, interfaces, and experiences that transform industries and define how we relate to the world. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>At ServiceNo</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>w, we ce</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>lebrate them, connect them, enable them.</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> We're proud of our role and even more proud of their accomplishments.</span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">To help quantify the impact they're having, we're re-launching the Index of PaaS Activity (IPA) as the <em><strong>Application Creation Index (ACI)</strong></em>. The shift is less a change in name and more a change in philosophy that reflects how customers use our platform.</p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"><a title="w.servicenow.com/customers.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/customers.html">Customers</a> like Red<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Hat, Land O'Lakes, and Tommy Bahama inspire us with stories about how they're fundamentally changing the nature of service delivery b</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">y empowering small teams with great app dev tools. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">The new name recognizes that the value application creators deliver isn't derived from the cloud services they consume but from their innovation - an</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">d the value metric for innovation is apps. </span></p><p class="p1"></p><p><img   alt="ACI January 2014.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="d132ec8edb10dfc03eb27a9e0f961906.iix" style="height: auto; float: right;"/></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">We'll calculate the index based on a weighted average of objective industry criteria that track the app dev movement. We'll take into account publicly-available data like stock prices, social media activity, and job postings plus our own data about custom application volume, trends</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">, an</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">d u</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">sage pat</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">terns. </span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>The index begins January with a score of 100</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">.

We'll alway</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">s invite feedback, particularly insights that challenge our assumptions and conclusions.</span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">In 2013, enterprise software re-emerged as the epicenter of technology innovation. In 2014, as an industry we'll finally acknowledge that application creators deserve the credit. Above all, we realize <strong>PaaS is pass√©, controlled by platform operators tasked with KTLO activities</strong>. By contrast, application creation is vibrant, controlled by doers defining the future of enterprise computing.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><strong>Software is eating the world. And we're hungrier than ever.</strong></p>
