<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="mountain-man-ron-kebic.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="271" src="ac01e4cedb5057049c9ffb651f961924.iix" style="height: 271.025641025641px; width: 182px; float: right;" width="182"/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some friends of mine that live in the oil fields of northern Canada recently expressed frustration at the lack of quality social interactions living so far out. I tease them for living 12 hours from civilization, and let them know that living in a city would offer more friend choices than grizzled ex-motorcycle gang oilmen. But in some ways it reminds me of the early days of IT. There were only a few vendors or suppliers available in a great many market segments. We were basically stuck with overpriced and overcomplicated, or forced to develop our own solutions. We simply couldn't be that selective since there weren't many selections to begin with.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The advent of online services changed the world, and ubiquitous network access now provides a much broader range of choices. Both of these have allowed ServiceNow has become the de facto standard for ITSM. But what's next?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The Customers!</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our customers constantly show us new and exciting ways to leverage the ServiceNow platform, and are passionate about providing feedback to strengthen the product. And the best ways to connect with a veritable metropolis of like-minded ServiceNow friends are the annual Knowledge conference, on now in San Francisco and next year in Las Vegas, and the Share and Community sites.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Knowledge</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/">Knowledge conference</a> connects customers from various industries across the globe with each other so that they can share their innovations, strategies and results. Each year, ideas are formed, taken away, executed, and eventually shared the following year. This cross-pollination creates a virtuous cycle of innovation year after year.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some of my favorite #know14 stats:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;">~6,000 IT pros and ServiceNow experts</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">~200 breakout sessions spanning CIO to Developer topics</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More than 100 labs</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ServiceNow customers deliver over 90% of sessions</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But not everyone can make it… for those that can't, and for those that need a daily ServiceNow fix, we offer much more!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Community</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The new <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/">ServiceNow community site</a> is a great place to connect with the same Knowledge attendees and content, and an even broader range of internal ServiceNow staff. There are hundreds of pieces of content, as well as a wide variety of topics to help you learn, develop, implement and support the product. This ranges from high level guidance to the dirtiest details. For example, <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I just learned multiple ways to </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=e8e14ba9db98dbc01dcaf3231f961974" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;">change the hint on an inherited field</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.</span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Share</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But what if you want to get beyond ideas, labs, and talks and you want the goods? You want the code, the scripts, the app extensions, the integrations, and most importantly the update sets.
