<p>The community is your hub for all of your Knowledge14 needs. Everything from the ever buzzing Buzzhub, to discussion areas, and Knowledge14 recaps and alerts can be found in the Knowledge14 spaces.</p><h1></h1><h1>Here are the two Knowledge14 spaces to follow:</h1><h2></h2><h2></h2><p></p><h2>Knowledge User Conference space</h2><p>The <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference">Knowledge User Conference</a> is the community's space to share all things Knowledge-related. You can start Knowledge the conversations in this space using the "Start a discussion" tool in your action box. This is the place to discussion sessions, speakers, share your wisdom from previous Knowledge conferences, and connect with other users who are attending Knowledge14. I encourage you to do start all your discussions and as your questions in this space, as it will allow all community users to see your content.</p><p></p><h2>Knowledge Registrant Exclusive Content space</h2><p>The <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/knowledge14">Knowledge Registrant Exclusive Content</a> space is only open for full pass holders. In this space you will find documentation and materials from the sessions and presentations. Like I mentioned above, it is better to post all your commentary and ask all of your questions in the public Knowledge User Conference space, rather than in the exclusive space.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With so much going on, how will you ever stay on top of the latest news, events and alerts that are being posted on the community? Don't worry, we have you covered. Getting alerts from the Knowledge14 spaces is easier than ever. All you have to do is click on "Follow" in the top-right corner of each space and assign it to the appropriate stream.</p><p></p><p>I went ahead and created a new stream called "Knowledge14." Any new posts or new activity in the Knowledge User Conference space will go into this stream.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-10 at 12.27.55 PM.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="ecbcff79dbd0db048c8ef4621f961993.iix" style="height: 351px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><img   alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-10 at 12.35.06 PM.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="c91cd1cadb1cd344e9737a9e0f9619f5.iix" style="height: 288px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;">You can adjust your email and inbox notifications in your account <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/user-preferences!input.jspa">preferences.</a> A blog post on how to set up your email inbox alerts will be coming soon.</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">You may also find these community threads helpful:</p><p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Tips - How to organize yourself on the community?" __default_attr="162514" __jive_macro_name="thread" class="jive_macro_thread jive_macro" data-orig-content="Tips - How to organize yourself on the community?" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=c8bf8765dbdcdbc01dcaf3231f96193e">Tips - How to organize yourself on the community?</a></p><p style="text-align: left;"><a title="How can I get updates and receive email notifications about the new activity occurring in User Groups that I am a part of?" __default_attr="162341" __jive_macro_name="thread" class="jive_macro_thread jive_macro" data-orig-content="How can I get updates and receive email notifications about the new activity occurring in User Groups that I am a part of?" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=bd81136ddbdcdbc01dcaf3231f961944">How can I get updates and receive email notifications about the new activity occurring in User Groups that I am a part of?</a></p>
