<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Ever wonder the process in which an Instance undergoes to be upgraded? ServiceNow upgrades are fully automated. They are handled in a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://hi.service-now.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HI</a> change record with the appropriate workflow being triggered. Here is a 3-tiered look at how the Upgrade process works when upgrading your ServiceNow instance.</span></p><p class="p4"></p><h2 class="p4">Upgrading an Instance:</h2><p></p><p class="p3"><strong>1. Submit the Upgrade Request</strong></p><p class="p3">When the Upgrade Change Request is submitted using the Service Catalog in Hi, the instance record will be updated to the WAR version value the customer intends to upgrade to. A<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> scheduled trigger job, "Upgrade," checks Hi hourly and compares the assigned version with the WAR version installed on the instance.</span></p><p class="p3">If there is a mismatch, the Upgrade will be triggered, and the instance will download the new WAR file from <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://install.service-now.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">install.service-now.com</a>.</p><p class="p4"></p><p class="p3"><strong>2. Sys Trigger Job "Upgrade" and How to Force It</strong></p><p class="p3">The above mentioned scheduled job runs once per hour. If the job runs at 21:40, and a change request ticket which updates the WAR version in Hi is scheduled for 21:45, you<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> would need to wait until 22:40 when the instance checks Hi again for the upgrade to be triggered.</span></p><p class="p4"></p><p class="p3">You can manually trigger the upgrade by setting the "Next Action" value to a value in the past, for example an hour earlier, and click the update UI Action. The instance will then run the scheduled job right away as it is passed trigger time.</p><p class="p4"></p><p class="p3">This job runs on an hourly basis because of its impact on performance and the fact that the instance will need to access Hi.</p><p class="p3">Running all jobs at the time of the change request could cause severe performance issues on Hi or your instance. Â  As upgrades are a planned exercise, it is not necessary to shorten the interval.</p><p class="p4"></p><p class="p3">It is important that there is no node value assigned in "System ID" in the sys_trigger job. If the node entered there was retired or redeployed, the upgrades would not trigger, as the "Starting Node" expected would not be available.</p><p class="p4"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-3644-15591/A7166BE1-D0DA-4BF1-912C-957EF7F18B9C.png"><img   alt="A7166BE1-D0DA-4BF1-912C-957EF7F18B9C.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="899" src="0c4e9406dbd85304b322f4621f9619be.iix" style="height: 351px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="1587"/></a></p><p class="p4"></p><p class="p4"></p><p class="p3"><strong>3. The Actual Upgrade</strong></p><p class="p3">Once the job is triggered, the instance checks <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://install.service-now.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">install.service-now.com </a>node by node and downloads the WAR file. T<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">he instance is upgraded one node at a time, so no downtime is expected except from each node restart after being upgraded. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Thereafter, the instance checks into Hi once more, changing the value of the installed WAR version and closing out the change record.</span></p><p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">For a video tutorial on how to schedule an update see <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="1147" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="3698" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=b90deaa5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961912">How to Schedule an Upgrade</a><br/></span></p>
