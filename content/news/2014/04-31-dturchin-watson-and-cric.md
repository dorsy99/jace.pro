Fred, Jedi Master of innovation, reminded us of that in his keynote and shared what's ahead with Visual Task Boards, favorites, tags, and WebRTC. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He reminded us why we love being on this multi-year journey to app dev nirvana with him. Reflecting on the journey... </span></p><p></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In 2011, we learned the power of a right click. Show matching, personalize, pie chart… configuration bliss.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In 2012, we discovered there's an entire platform beneath those apps. "Hey...this isn't just for IT!"</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In 2013, we realized others had done what we were doing and asked for help.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In 2014, we can now tap the hive mind. We think it will improve the app dev experience at least as much as "Show matching" in 2011.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Today <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/blog/2014/04/30/watson-and-crick-we-see-your-double-helix-and-raise-you-share">we announced ServiceNow Share</a>. It's alchemy for apps. Catnip for Creators. A simple, intuitive way for app developers to post what they've built, download content from the community, and get inspired. It's a great way to accelerate development but its significance goes far beyond that. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA. 50 years later in 2003 we sequenced it which finally made it possible to apply that knowledge broadly to diagnose genetic diseases. For 50 long years we understood the structure of DNA and couldn't use it commercially. For 50 years we were educated but not empowered. Then theory and practice collided and the world expanded. Minds expanded. Lives changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We didn't sequence the genome and we're pretty sure alleles are from that '90s legal sitcom with the skinny actress… but what we did do that has similar impact for Creators is launch ServiceNow Share. It lets them discover everything from… </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">App extensions like automated SLA timers to </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Scripts that replicate data across forms to </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Discovery probes for CIs we don't find to </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">CMS templates for your industry to </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Whole apps that automate procurement or pharmaceutical compliance or property management. </span></li></ul><p style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You can subscribe to content and get notified when it's updated then rate and review it and search the whole library by category, popularity, author, or rating. It's as easy to publish your work as it is to find and download from others. Share is available now. And it's just the beginning of a massive investment we're making to help you learn, collaborate, and discover.</span></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We realize that when you didn't know where to look you were guaranteed to not find what you need. Like an Escher or Magritte painting, Share makes the world both bigger and smaller at the same time.</span></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I'm inspired by what has already been shared…but even more inspired by your reactions. The best Share quote I've heard at Knowledge14 came during yesterday's Creator meetup: <em>"…You just made me smarter! I haven't been this excited about work since we banned Clippy!"</em></span></p>
