<p>On the 17 June ServiceNow publicly announced its Eureka release. If you are full of interest but short of time then this blog is for you.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>To quote from the official press release: </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><em>"The products and features in this new ServiceNow release give IT the ability to create a new service experience for business users and improve the framework on which IT can deliver those services across the enterprise.   For example, business users can use Service Creator to independently create and deliver services that automate mundane tactical activities typically managed in spreadsheets and email.   For larger projects, IT can use ServiceNow Demand Management to easily assess the demand from each business function and then use the new CIO Roadmap to drive conversations with business stakeholders about IT investment decisions. Services can be automated with applications that are purpose-built to solve specific business challenges.   These applications can be custom created by users or are offered as complete and customizable applications built by ServiceNow, such as ServiceNow Facilities Service Automation. And the underlying infrastructure can be managed with a comprehensive set of technologies, including ServiceNow Event Management, that enable fast remediation of the issues that could cause business interruptions."</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3183-10920/1402992556413.png"><img  alt="1402992556413.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="369" src="56a53c86db9c5f048c8ef4621f96196a.iix" style="height: 311px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="736"/></a></p><p>For more detail, please read on …</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Service Creator</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/custom-application-development/service-creator.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Service Creator</a> empowers non-technical business users to quickly build applications on the ServiceNow Service Automation Platform. Individuals request the services provided by these new applications in a service catalog. Service Creator provides a simple drag-and-drop experience that enables business users to create or modify applications without programming knowledge or experience.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Facilities Service Automation</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/shared-services-applications/facilities-service-automation.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Facilities Service Automation</a> automates the request and delivery of facilities information and services. Requests are automatically assigned to designated facilities specialists or teams using configurable rules. Integrated reporting provides insights into volume, types of requests and individual workloads so that facilities teams can optimize resources, improve preventative maintenance cycles, align services with company priorities, and demonstrate impact to the business.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Event Management</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/event-management.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Event Management</a> automatically creates actionable alerts from events captured by third-party monitoring tools. A configurable dashboard provides a consolidated view of all service-impacting events, including a list of current active alerts, impacted services, and associated incidents. In order to generate qualified alerts, events are processed through filters that normalize and de-duplicate the incoming stream. Alerts are then mapped to configuration items (CIs) in the ServiceNow Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and rules may be applied to trigger automated actions.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Demand Management</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/demand-management.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Demand Management</a> centralizes strategic requests from the business to IT and streamlines the investment decision process for new products and services — or enhancements and defect repairs to existing products and services. Demand Management enables the generation, development and communication of new ideas — supporting corporate initiatives to drive and grow the business. The application provides the ability to assess, manage and accurately forecast demand for products and services.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Visual Task Boards</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9gfRhtuC2U" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Visual Task Boards</a> are a new feature to organize services and other tasks using kanban-inspired boards that foster collaboration and increase productivity.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>CIO Roadmap</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBX6MOiCkzM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CIO Roadmap</a> is a new timeline visualization feature that displays prioritized investment decisions across business functions.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Field Service Automation</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>As mentioned in a previous <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="3146" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=844d6ee5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619c6">blog</a>, ServiceNow Work Management has been enhanced and rebranded as <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/shared-services-applications/field-service-automation.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Field Service Automation</a>.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Want to read more?
