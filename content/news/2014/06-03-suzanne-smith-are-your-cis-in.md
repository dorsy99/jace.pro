<p>Do you need an automatic method of checking that certain CIs are in a particular state?   For example, ensuring that servers have at least a specified minimum amount of RAM and disk space or that critical business services have a manager, support group, and approval group assigned? For an easy way to tackle these tasks, try the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Desired_State" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Desired State</span></a></span> application. This application performs scheduled or on-demand audits of specific CMDB data.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>You have complete control over the CIs and states to analyze. Follow these steps:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol><li>Create a filter to identify the CIs to certify. You can create as many filters or variations as you'd like and activate the ones to use.</li><li>Create a template that defines the desired state for the CIs.</li><li>Using the template, create an audit. The audit identifies the target CIs that do not match the specified desired state.</li><li>Run the audit.</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Because the application has done the work to identify the discrepancies, you can focus your time on resolving the discrepancies. For example, in these audit results for the critical business services example, several failures are identified because the support group field is blank. Contact the right people to determine the support groups for those business services.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3139-10482/DS_blog_post.png"><img  alt="DS_blog_post.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="218" src="6cd2b40edb5c57049c9ffb651f9619e1.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 167px;" width="807"/></a></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Give the Desired State application a try and let us know the creative ways you are using it to efficiently manage CIs.</p>
