Whatever food-related metaphor you prefer, there's a lot of credibility to be gained from taking advice you've given to others. Especially if that advice has proven helpful to those others. After all, to torture yet another culinary metaphor, what's sauce for the goose is often sauce for the gander. As they say.</p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">KPMG has been in the business of giving good advice to enterprise leaders since it began life as an accounting firm in the late 1800s. Today, KPMG LLP, a US-based "audit, tax and advisory firm," is the US member of an international cooperative of more than 145,000 professionals operating in 152 countries.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Among its advisory service offerings is a CIO advisory practice. And that practice had advised numerous KPMG clients to adopt ServiceNow as a platform for transformation of IT, and provided integration services to optimize the business value of those ServiceNow investments. Or as KPMG itself puts it, "KPMG teams with ServiceNow to help enterprises find and sustain value in their IT spending. We help clients cut through complexity to turn knowledge into value."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">It's an approach that's working for those clients. ServiceNow is one of only 12 companies with which KPMG has forged strategic alliances. In May of 2013, KPMG was named ServiceNow's first Sales Partner of the Year. And KPMG has graciously supported the Knowledge13 and Knowledge14 conferences as a Premier Sponsor. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">More recently, the KPMG-ServiceNow relationship has deepened further. As reported on July 31 by <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2358178/kpmg-opts-for-servicenow-workflow-after-being-advised-by-client-facing-cio-advisory-board" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Computing</a>, KPMG's usually customer-facing CIO advisory service has recommended ServiceNow to another client: KPMG itself. A primary impetus of that recommendation? Modernization of KPMG's legacy IT infrastructure. ""We have started working more with the business in the last 12 months, and a lot of that is to do with the credibility of our people because our technology was so old [before] that we had no credibility with the business, and now they've started to work with us," said CIO Edel McGrath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Another positive transformation taking place at KPMG? "I have seen my role change significantly because we've gone from being a backend plumbing service provider to partnering with the business," McGrath added. A survey conducted by KPMG and ServiceNow at Knowledge14 found that more than 93 percent of respondents are seeing the same transformation taking place at their own enterprises.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">The power of the ServiceNow Service Automation Platform has enabled KPMG to help multiple enterprises to transform IT service management and to improve business-critical processes within and beyond IT. The adoption of ServiceNow by KPMG for its own IT infrastructure is strong validation of the business value enabled by the ServiceNow Platform, in combination with the process expertise and deep experience of KPMG's advisory professionals. KPMG can now hold itself up as a premier example of how to turn "knowledge into value" with ServiceNow. The company can also leverage its successes with other clients to drive further improvements to its own service delivery and management efforts, and bring what it learns internally to its external clients as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">IT leaders everywhere should follow KPMG's example here. If you and your team believe in the tools, processes and services you use to support others, demonstrate your belief by using them yourselves. And do whatever it takes to be able to hold up your efforts as examples of the business benefits of doing so. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">To see how we're eating and thriving on our own cooking at ServiceNow, check out Chief Operating Officer and Senior VP Dan McGee's Knowledge14 Day Three keynote, "<a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcu1LpjfcjY&amp;list=UULukrOQYSgsHUR_NSiVZndQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Running the Service-Oriented Enterprise</a>."
