<p>Gung-ho old school developers and coders alike are always happy until it comes to two points:</p><p></p><ol><li>Testing</li><li>Documentation</li></ol><p></p><p>I have always thought that Service-Now could provide a solution to the second.</p><p>I mean, it's all there. Â  Customer updates, details, description on most of the items, dependencies, references, table relationships and many other resources.</p><p></p><p>I would think that by now some service provider would have developed a module or app that went into Service-Now, gathered all these customizations, and spat out a nice, eloquent, fancily formatted document that you could then easily update with final touches, export and store as "documentation".</p><p></p><p>Would that be asking too much?</p>
