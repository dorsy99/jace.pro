<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Not considering Discovery for a bit, most organizations seem to take one of two basic approaches to build out their configuration management capabilities: top-down or bottom-up.   Let's talk about each of.</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We didn't define "IT Services" in our first post, so lets do so now.   IT Services are those capabilities provided and supported by IT that enable their users to accomplish business goals.   ITIL goes into considerable depth discussing costs and risks, service hierarchies, IT vs. business services, etc. but we can dispense with that complexity for now.   Service CIs are the upper, logical layer of the CMDB and a top-down approach means first understanding the services IT provides to the business (and sometimes external customers), and then looking at where those services "link" to the physical infrastructure. If, for example,   we define   "Communication via Email" as a service IT provides to the business, then the likely link point between the service and the infrastructure would be the Exchange or Notes application.   As we build out our understanding of the IT services provided, we can start to link things like incidents and changes to those services.   </span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">A bottom-up approach flips this understanding.   We first identify and categorize all the IT infrastructure we can including hardware, software, etc. Then we eventually use that information as the starting point to define the services provided.   That discussion frequently focuses on software applications supported, as once again they are the interface between IT and the business.   So for example, I learn all about the server that SAP runs on, and I then can define the SAP Human Resources "service" that it supports. Similarly, as we build our understanding of the IT infrastructure, we learn how it supports those services.   In our example, that might be databases or web servers that enable Notes or Exchange.</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In both cases, it is considered good practice to build a future model of the expected CMDB class structure (services and infrastructure) in order to understand "where we want to be" when the CMDB is mature.   The model will almost certainly change over time.   ServiceNow's CMDB structure is a good starting point, and for some customers requires very little, if any, modification.   Also, either approach is severely limited without a thorough understanding of the relationships between the configuration items, whether services or infrastructure.   A CMDB without relationships is only a list.</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Listed are some pros and cons of each approach:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><br/></span></p><table border="1" class="jiveBorder" jive-data-cell="{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;#575757&quot;,&quot;textAlign&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;padding&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;backgroundColor&quot;:&quot;transparent&quot;,&quot;fontFamily&quot;:&quot;arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;,&quot;verticalAlign&quot;:&quot;baseline&quot;}" jive-data-header="{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;,&quot;backgroundColor&quot;:&quot;#6690BC&quot;,&quot;textAlign&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;padding&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}" style="border: 1px solid #000000;
