We hosted an event before the Brewers-Cubs game at Miller Park. Before I could enjoy my first liquid manna (PSA: please support MillerCoors - excellent ServiceNow customer, fine brews) I got distracted by a group of customers huddled in the corner having an animated conversation. It resembled one of those <a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=4tYXr_VsQKY" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tYXr_VsQKY">heated debates in Parliament</a> without the powdered wigs. I arrived just before punches were thrown.</p><p class="p2"></p><ul><li><strong>The topic</strong>: how to manage demand from the business for new ServiceNow apps.</li><li><strong>The debate</strong>: how much is too much of a good thing.</li><li><strong>The context</strong>: word got out that IT could replace SharePoint apps and the flood gates opened. Opportunity or problem?</li></ul><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">I was mesmerized. Inspired. Excited. I felt like Wayne and Garth at an Aerosmith concert. These were my brethren geeking out about the one thing that will re-define the identify of IT.</p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">I bit my tongue. I tried to not dominate the conversation. Then when it devolved into third graders sharing baseball cards on the playground I jumped in. We spent the first inning exchanging ideas for apps and demonstrating our wares on smartphones. I must admit Taylor's learning management system for tracking employee training put most of mine to shame.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">We came to a few conclusions about how best to accommodate demand:</p><ol><li><strong>Establish a model for app ownership and support</strong>. Before committing to the business, answer these three questions:<ul><li>Who owns the feature backlog?</li><li>Who takes first-line support calls?</li><li>What will it cost to deliver the service and who is paying?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Require a dedicated business sponsor from the line of business</strong>. Develop requirements with the business, in scrum-style sprints where possible, and treat the business sponsor as your product owner. Each story (requirement) must have clear acceptance criteria from the business.</li><li><strong>Focus on the end-user experience</strong>. Before defining requirements, white board the lifecycle of an interaction from the perspective of the user. Then recruit a power user and have him/her provide feedback during the development process.</li></ol><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">The Brewers lost. My new friends barely noticed. Taylor and Warren, you're bigger geeks than me. And that's the highest compliment I can pay.</p>
