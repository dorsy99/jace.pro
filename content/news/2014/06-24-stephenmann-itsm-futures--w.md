<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In a previous blog — <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2811" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=814ee2addbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96199d">What&amp;#8217;s The Future Of ITSM?</a> — I listed 15 elements that will potentially contribute to the future of IT service management (ITSM). I also promised to return to some of these 15 elements at a later date. It's definitely a lot later, but this is the first — a blog that looks at my opinion that <em>"IT will need to redefine its role before it becomes an IT service delivery 'bit player.'" </em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em> </em>  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Where:<em> </em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em> </em>  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em>"A bit player has a small or unimportant role in something." </em>Source: <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/bit+player.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/bit+player.html</a> </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3196-11094/6099160908_2b1855986b_z.jpg"><img  alt="6099160908_2b1855986b_z.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="315" src="63142d8adb1cd304b322f4621f96199d.iix" style="height: 305px; width: 620px;" width="640"/></a></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The big question for me is whether your average corporate IT organization (and its people) has really adapted with the times or whether they have just adapted with the technology. And, because of this singular focus on the technology, whether they understand the predicament that they are potentially in. That is whether they understand what "delivering IT as a service" (as per ITIL in particular) really entails, whether they understand the "laws of supply and demand," whether they have noticed a loss of their IT-monopoly, and whether they understand the concept of customer or service experience.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Ultimately, like the <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">frog-in-boiling-water anecdote</a>, whether they have blissfully bathed-on unaware of the temperature rising around them.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Increased perplexity from the additional complexity</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In my opinion, the changing business and IT landscapes have jointly made being the "preferred supplier" and then delivering the required IT services more difficult than ever been. There are many challenges and opportunities to consider and address, which include: </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><strong>The need for increased speed of change</strong> — the enterprise needs innovation, that's business innovation not just IT innovation. It needs to be ahead of the competitor pack in how it operates, in terms of both front and back office activities, and how it delivers products, services, and customer or service experience. It can't afford to wait for the internal IT organization to deliver. It won't wait.</li><li><strong>The impact of consumer IT experiences</strong> — consumer IT has changed dramatically over the last ten years. And with it employee and customer expectations of hardware, applications, services, and the associated service experience. For any service provider, the failure to deliver on <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2772" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=ec8c66e1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961921">service experience</a> is one step closer to irrelevancy.</li><li><strong>Increased reliance on outsourcing and multiple third-party service providers</strong> — with <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="1354" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=62bc2e25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96198f">the need to manage these disparate service providers</a> in terms of quality, cost, and innovation. It's difficult, and cannot be done effectively using just personal productivity tools and email. Instead, a formal model and mechanisms are needed to manage the relationships with the service providers and to ultimately provide seamless IT service delivery.</li><li><strong>The increased adoption of cloud</strong> — which not only removes much of what the IT organization has traditionally done, in terms of managing the infrastructure, but again also adds to the need to effectively manage third-party service providers and the services they deliver.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I could go on, and I deliberately didn't mention "<a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2850" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=eebdeaa9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96195f">Shadow IT</a>," but hopefully this has you thinking about the relevance of "traditional" IT functions, their operations, their mindsets, and their behaviors. Importantly, we can no longer <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDMacGAoqsk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">deliver IT like it's 1999</a>.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>New roles for IT? Don't be limited by your limitations</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Surely the role and responsibilities of the CIO and their team need to change? As the corporate IT organization gets further removed from the IT infrastructure — no longer touching servers, which is now for the cloud companies to do — and with the higher expectations of IT service providers, what is it going to do? </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In my opinion, the answer very much depends on the CIO and senior IT management's imagination, desire, and ability to envision a new role or roles for the IT organization. And it's important to act now to avoid the continued marginalization of the IT organization through an evolution that will ends with it as a bit-player (sorry for the drama queen moment).</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Should IT aspire to a brokerage role? </strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I hear a lot of predictions related to IT becoming a "service broker." It makes sense but I don't think that IT should settle for this or similar diminished roles, such as:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><strong>An IT advisory function</strong> — where lines of business procure their own IT services with assistance from "the corporate technology experts."</li><li><strong>A specialist procurement vehicle</strong> — helping lines of business from a requirements, governance, and value-for-money perspective.</li><li><strong>A service broker</strong> — bringing in and managing services from third parties as needed. Providing a contract management capability from a SLA point of view. Maybe also managing supplier relationships.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Service Broker might sound great, just like Frontline Educational Culinary Consultant sounds better than a School Dinner/Lunch Helper, but surely this service administration role, while valid, is a dilution of where IT was in the 2000s and …</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>… Whatever happened to the exciting IT of the 1990s?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Yes, many corporate IT organizations have come on leaps and bounds in the last 20 years (particularly on the back of ITIL) but, again in my opinion, what happened to the view that IT was innovative and the CIO was a business visionary? It's as though IT found its comfort zone — supporting the infrastructure and systematically reacting to business projects — and now struggles to step outside it. </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">But, thankfully, there is already scope to create new opportunities and roles for IT, for instance some of the things I've covered in previous blogs:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Leading, rather than following, on <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="3193" data-objecttype="38" href="/community/blogs/blog/2014/06/20/the-future-and-ongoing-relevance-of-itil-part-three-enterprise-service-management-best-practice">enterprise service management</a>.</li><li>Providing advice and capabilities around <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2806" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=735c6aa1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619e3">consumerization and improved service delivery</a> for other corporate service providers.</li><li>Working closer with lines of business in a proactive rather than reactive way, and talking about business outcomes not the technology itself (so working on things like business operations optimization and new product/service development).</li><li>If warranted, using a <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="1354" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=62bc2e25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96198f">SIAM</a> (service integration and management) model and capabilities to deliver what outsourcing didn't — cost reduction, service improvement, and innovation.</li><li>Making <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="1317" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=34bc6a25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96197b">support</a> more akin to facilitation — imagine if a service desk agent knew that an employee would benefit from, and automatically offered up, a new device or application before the employee requested it. </li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">It makes you wonder what IT could achieve if it wasn't bogged down in the technology and the associated technological issues. With the freedom to think outside the data center, about the things that really matter to business operations.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Hopefully the average corporate IT organization won't be limited to a bit player role but, unfortunately, that role will be quietly assumed if IT continues to focus on, get bogged down by, the technology rather that the effective use of the technology. <strong><em>So what are you doing to create the next incarnation of your corporate IT organization?</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em><em>Image source: </em></em><em><em><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlbalaco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlbalaco/</a> </em></em></p>
