<p>Knowledge articles are a great way to share information with members of your organization. For example, you could use the knowledge base to store information about common hardware or software issues. This would allow end users to do more troubleshooting on their own and provide ITIL users with resources to resolve these issues quickly. Additionally, by viewing the information on the overview page, you can see which content is the most heavily viewed. This will help you identify what information is most important to your users. This video provides an overview of the knowledge application along with some tips to help you make the most of it.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/7JrLzURzsBA" width="640" height="360"/></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"></p><p>For more information about the knowledge application, see:</p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Knowledge_Management_with_KCS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Knowledge Management with KCS - ServiceNow Wiki</a></p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Creating_Knowledge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Creating Knowledge - ServiceNow Wiki</a></p><p class="p1" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"></p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit;">Your feedback will help us better serve you!</span></p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span class="s1" style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit;">Did you find this video helpful?
