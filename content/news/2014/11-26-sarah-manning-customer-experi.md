<p><strong>By </strong><a _jive_internal="true" href="/people/angela.burk"><strong>Angela Burk</strong></a></p><p></p><p>The quest for perfection has always been a temptation for technology companies—getting something as close to perfect as possible before releasing it or letting it go.</p><p></p><p>Mat Barter, Tool Support Manager at Vantiv, one of the most trusted and respected organizations in the payment processing industry, knows that the ServiceNow platform enables an endless array of possibilities for service automation and creating extended value across the enterprise. At the same time, there are practical limits of how much time can be devoted to each new service. His philosophy is to get the users to a better place, faster.   Identify the minimum viable product, build to those requirements and go live with it sooner rather than later. Even basic capabilities can be delivered in good working order and then perfected over time.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="angela blog1.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="ff25a04edbdc5304b322f4621f9619da.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Initially, Barter and his team rolled ServiceNow Incident Management, Problem Management and Change Management out in under three months. "What really allowed us to do that<span style="color: black;">?</span>" Mat raises as a question. "We knew that incident, problem and change management weren't going to be perfect immediately. For us it was an 80/20 rule. We got 80 percent of the way initially and then perfected the remaining 20 percent over time. We were able to launch and go live, knowing that we could quickly respond to anything that might be missing. For instance, we added two or three incident fields shortly after launch."</p><p></p><p>The great advantage Vantiv experienced in introducing a new capability was quickly capturing use<span style="color: black;">rs'</span> imaginations with what can be accomplished and gaining early acceptance. This approach led to fast-paced innovation and a rapid proliferation of ServiceNow capabilities.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="angela blog2.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="3c2400c2db58db048c8ef4621f9619cc.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Toggling between their development and production instances of ServiceNow, the group is constantly making improvements and additions to their applications in the development instance, testing them in the UAT instance and then pushing them out to the production instance. They develop in two-week sprints and push releases to production every week, continually delivering value to the business with rapid turnaround.</p><p></p><p>"We are getting immediate feedback, and customers are getting immediate benefit of it," says Barter. "We push out quickly, follow up, make corrections, push again, make corrections, push again, and so forth."</p><p></p><p>"We feel we are making a huge impact," Barter says. "I like when people ask if we can do this, and the first answer is yes. That's pretty empowering for a team to know that they've got the right tools in their toolbox to do the job every day and not feel like their hands are being tied."</p>
