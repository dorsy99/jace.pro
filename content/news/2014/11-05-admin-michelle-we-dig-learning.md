<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Differentiate, Integrate, Generalize.</strong></span> DIG is how adults learn and how ServiceNow courses are designed to deliver a superior learning experience.</p><p></p><p>DIG is a proven approach to curriculum architecture. The ServiceNow Education Services team builds courses that provide a variety of experiences to accommodate and support effective learning, creating new materials for every release based on instructional design principles like DIG.</p><p></p><p><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-3081-15428/pastedImage_0.png"><img   alt="" class="image-0 jiveImage" height="290" src="55e60446dbd8db048c8ef4621f961925.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;" width="454"/></a></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br/></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Differentiate: We DIG with Superior Materials and Learning Environment</strong></span></p><p>Have you ever used an online resource that was images of printed text? You know the look - blockish letters and whole pages slightly skewed. These are the "tells" of re-used and re-purposed materials. In a ServiceNow class, we originate materials designed for our delivery formats, supplying our trainers and Authorized Training Partners (ATPs) with content designed to maximize your training hours.</p><p></p><p>For the duration of the training, each student has a dedicated, ServiceNow instance to practice and use as a safe sandbox. That's right - a full base instance in which to do labs. In advanced courses, the use of Update Sets is encouraged to move the great lab work you have completed in a student instance back to a company instance.</p><p></p><p>Another differentiator is our use of social media. The Training Dept Live Feed instance is used for communication, not only between instructor and student, but between students and other classes. It is available after course completion too, so our students can visit and review class discussions.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Integrate: We DIG What you Know</strong></span></p><p>Ever take a course that veers wildly between being too easy and too hard? Chances are the course content comes from multiple sources. Our course materials were conceived to tier important concepts, using lab work to step into later lab work. In a ServiceNow class, you may participate in a team exercise, complete an architecture lab that asks you to sketch your solution, play a game, complete a case study that gives real-world motivation for introducing specific tasks, or troubleshoot because fixing something is sometimes the best way to learn. All of these formats honor the experiences that you bring to class.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Generalize: We DIG Learning Paths Â  <br/></strong></span></p><p></p><p>How do you generalize what you have learned? You apply it in other areas. We <em>employ</em> our students to do administration work for a fictitious company named Cloud Dimensions as class integrates real-world scenarios to motivate labs, identifying (learning) paths through the platform to achieve learning objectives. And while you are on a learning path, consider taking more classes. Our Training Catalog includes courses on specific applications like Asset Management and Discovery, Developer-focused courses like Application Creation, and administration classes like System Administration and Advanced System Administration.</p><p></p><p><strong>We DIG, how about you?
