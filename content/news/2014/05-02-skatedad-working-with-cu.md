<p>During Knowledge14 (which was an extremely well run and thought provoking event) I had many conversations with existing or potential ServiceNow customers on the changes that ServiceNow have made to their licensing approach. The concensus view was that there had been very little dialogue with customers on the rationale for the changes, or the impact that they could have on customers utilisation and exploitation of the platform.</p><p>There does not appear to be any User Group dedicated to procurement and commercial key decision makers to help facilitate and discuss directly with ServiceNow the vision ServiceNow has for it's product, so that customers could help ServiceNow to be as innovative and customer focussed in their pricing models as they are in their product development.</p><p></p><p>What do people think?</p>
