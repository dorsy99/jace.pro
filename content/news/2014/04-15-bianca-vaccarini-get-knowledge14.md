<p>Now that you are<a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/blog/2014/04/14/follow-the-knowledge14-spaces"> Following the Knowledge14 User Conference spaces</a>, you need to adjust your notifications to make sure you are getting alerts for all of the important updates, and maybe even for the not-so-important updates.</p><p></p><p><strong>There are two levels of notifications: community inbox notifications and email inbox notifications.</strong></p><h2></h2><h2>Community Inbox Notifications</h2><p>By default, the community sets you up with two streams called "Connection Stream," and "Inbox" all of the content and people that you follow on the community will go into one of these streams in your community inbox. The key to organizing the content and people you follow on the community is to create multiple streams. When there is new activity in a stream, a grey square icon will appear next to that stream on the activity list.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-10 at 1.33.52 PM.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="4bea740adbdcdfc03eb27a9e0f961934.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>In order to see the new activity you follow, you will need to login to the community and view these streams.

You can edit the email notifications of your default or personal streams in your <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/user-preferences!input.jspa">account preferences</a>.

Don't miss a beat this year. You won't want to miss the recaps and insight from the sessions and labs. Think of it as your resource to all of the labs and sessions without having to attend all of them.</p><p></p><p>You may find these community threads helpful:</p><p><a title="How can I get updates and receive email notifications about the new activity occurring in User Groups that I am a part of?" __default_attr="162341" __jive_macro_name="thread" class="jive_macro_thread jive_macro" data-orig-content="How can I get updates and receive email notifications about the new activity occurring in User Groups that I am a part of?" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=bd81136ddbdcdbc01dcaf3231f961944">How can I get updates and receive email notifications about the new activity occurring in User Groups that I am a part of?</a></p><p><a title="Tips - How to organize yourself on the community?" __default_attr="162514" __jive_macro_name="thread" class="jive_macro_thread jive_macro" data-orig-content="Tips - How to organize yourself on the community?" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=c8bf8765dbdcdbc01dcaf3231f96193e">Tips - How to organize yourself on the community?</a></p>
