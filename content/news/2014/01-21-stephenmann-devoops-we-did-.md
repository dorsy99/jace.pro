<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">At the end of 2013 I read a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/open-source-insider/2013/11/whats-the-problem-with-devops.html?utm_content=buffercf73f&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer#.UopDy9el5Kg.twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DevOps blog/article</a> which stated that a big issue with DevOps is that: </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: center;"><strong><em>"DevOps is just a bit too much Ops and not quite enough Dev."</em></strong></p><p align="center" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: center;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Which was odd IMO as I'd always figured it to be the other way round — that AppDev colleagues have been actively focused on improving how they work and in many ways hopefully how they think about IT delivery. Whereas IT Operations have clung on to the ITIL-espoused Continual Service Improvement concept and by "clung" I mean they have a related book on the shelf that doesn't get opened much. Very much a one-sided affair with a big "DEV" and little "ops" — DEVops.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Thankfully <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-link-profile-small" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="2937" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=b9a05a6ddb581fc09c9ffb651f9619f7">Simon Morris</a>, my ServiceNow colleague, corrected my thinking on this — that the aforementioned Ops over-emphasis is not about the respective participation of organizationally-split teams but rather that there is still too much IT Operations activity needed in DevOps. That there is a need to extend Agile thinking to IT delivery, using automation wherever it can cost-effectively help.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Importantly, the article got me thinking about the need for DevOps, I particularly like the tagline on <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.devops.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DevOps.com</a>: <em>"Helping finish what Agile development started." </em>And, beyond this, where it is heading.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>But what is DevOps?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I guess it depends who you ask and, in some instances, it depends on vested interests and what they are trying to sell you.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2785-7962/DevOps Elephant.png"><img  alt="DevOps Elephant.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="529" src="9660d10adbd413043eb27a9e0f9619e8.iix" style="height: 456px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="720"/></a>Image source: <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.devopsdays.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.devopsdays.org</a></p><p align="center" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">And as per usual, I'm happy to start with the <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia.org definition</a>, that:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: center;"><em>"DevOps (a portmanteau of development and operations) is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals."</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">And Damon Edwards' definition of DevOps on <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.dev2ops.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.dev2ops.org</a>:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: center;"><em>"DevOps is a response to the growing awareness that there is a disconnect between what is traditionally considered development activity and what is traditionally considered operations activity. This disconnect often manifests itself as conflict and inefficiency."</em></p><p align="center" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: center;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Bingo!</p><p align="center" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: center;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>OK, so what is the DevOps reality?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">There are the organizations that have made, or are starting to make, DevOps work. There are others where there is still much to be done. In the annual joint itSMF USA and Forrester IT service management (ITSM) survey DevOps in 2013 is described as "<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/courtney_bartlett/13-11-01-itsmf_fusion_13_graduation_and_revolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>slightly more seamless and collaborative than isolated</em></a><em>.</em>"</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">But DevOps is on the radar of most large organizations, if only as a talking point. And you can't escape the growing number of jobs with DevOps in the title, DevOps tools to cure all your IT woes, and DevOps training and certification so that you can get that DevOps job you always wanted.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Can you see where I am going yet?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Does it sound familiar? Is it a case of: "I'll see your ITIL* and raise you my DevOps"? Are we in danger of taking something started with the best of intentions and turning into a Frankenstein's Monster through the usual bout of vendor profiteering? Though there is nothing wrong with profiteering as long as it is a win-win for the seller and the buyer.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Yes I might be a jaded ex-IT Operations professional but I ask these questions only to get people to look beyond new job titles, new processes, new training courses and certifications, and new tools to see the real driver for DevOps. An outside-in, qualification and tool-agnostic, driver that is about improving the quality of IT service delivery such that our businesses operate more efficiently and effectively on the back of better IT.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>It needs mindset over matter</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">So what I'm asking for is a universal and unified change of mindset across Dev and across Ops first. Not a sea change in Dev that gets nullified by an unmovable Ops. Nor a "tab A in slot B"-type approach that merely goes through the motions of "doing" DevOps. We've been there, done that, and bought the t-shirt with ITIL. Let's deliver DevOps properly.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em>As always, your thoughts and opinions are appreciated.</em></strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>   <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">* ITIL is the ITSM best practice framework <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2669" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=b7dd6ae9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619ea">formerly known as the IT Infrastructure Library</a></span></p>
