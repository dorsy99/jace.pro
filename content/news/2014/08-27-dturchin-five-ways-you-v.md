Our Walt Disney, our Henry Ford, our Steve Jobs - our Fred Luddy - founded this company with a vision to build better software for businesses. Software that makes lives better. Software he actually wanted to use. </span></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Today's technology is unrecognizable from the WAP phones, Flash animations, and simple web forms we used in 2004 but Fred's vision hasn't changed. What we didn't see coming is how you'd make it more than we ever imagined.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">I've been at ServiceNow 21 dog years and have had an opportunity to meet many of our most vocal, passionate, creative customers. You've inspired me beyond words which is largely why I'm moving on to my next adventure at the end of the month.</p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">Walt Disney said "it's kind of fun to do the impossible". Seeing what you've achieved with our platform awakened the serial disrupter in me. It reminded me why technology keeps evolving and why we'll always mock naysayers like the IBM big brains who famously said "640KB of memory ought to be enough for anybody" in 1970. There's always room for innovation.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Here are five reasons why this community will continue to be a verb for the rest of the tech industry ("Hey, Apple did a ServiceNow on Fitbit with <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HealthKit</a>!"):</p><p class="p1"></p><ul><li><em>Team MetroPCS developed a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/company/media/diagrams-and-infographics.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suite of ServiceNow apps</a> for internal lines of business that automates everything from engineering requests to legal contract approval.</em></li><li><em>Customers ranging from American Airlines to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="1138" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2645" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=4b4ea6addbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96190c">Santander Consumer USA</a> to American Express have hosted internal hack-a-thons without platform restrictionsâ€¦and all other entrants (especially the poor souls who selected dot net) suffered defeat at the hands of the ServiceNow teams.</em></li><li><em>Paul Hardy from Informa has become a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/PaulHardyUK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media sensation</a> by proudly sharing his ServiceNow exploits (and British wit) with a growing legion of followers.</em></li><li><em>Jim Keene from Harley-Davidson became a hero at work by satisfying a key business requirement for credential management in record time with a simple search on <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/home/false" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Share</a>.</em></li><li><em>The Home Depot supply chain team embraced an opportunity to use the platform for social good by automating the routing of emergency supplies to hard-hit areas after hurricanes and tornadoes.</em></li></ul><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">As long as there are amazing people doing amazing things with amazing products, ServiceNow will be here to listen, react, and innovate.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Your energy and enthusiasm are infectious.
