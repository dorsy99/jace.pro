<p>In my previous blog — <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="3190" data-objecttype="38" href="/community/blogs/blog/2014/06/20/the-future-and-ongoing-relevance-of-itil-part-one-itil-25-years-on">The Future And Ongoing Relevance Of ITIL Part One: ITIL 25 Years On</a> — I glanced back over 25 years of ITIL and at how AXELOS are bringing ITIL into the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ZKlT1EvCA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">21<sup>st</sup> century</a>. In the second of the three blog series, I talk to the need for <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl3vxEudif8#t=52" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">change</a>. Not just because of the changing technology landscape but also from a business perspective. In particular because of the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2772" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=ec8c66e1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961921">consumerization of service</a> and the growing adoption of enterprise service management.</p><p></p><p><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-3191-11055/532076662_55fac597b9_z.jpg"><img   alt="532076662_55fac597b9_z.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="480" src="50a2d4c6dbd05304b322f4621f9619d4.iix" style="height: 465px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="640"/></a></p><p><strong>The consumerization of service</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Believe it or not, service management didn't originate in IT, nor is it only applicable to IT. It applies to all service providers, internal and external. This point brings us around to the first of these two "trends": the consumerization of service. Where employees are bringing their personal-life and consumer-driven expectations into the workplace, and not just when it comes to their personal devices (the consumerization of IT—notably BYOD—grabs all the <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimoNqiulUE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">headlines</a>, doesn't it?).</p><p></p><p>Thus technical service and support organizations need to step up their game when it comes to service delivery and service experience, focusing on ease of use, self-service, service catalogs, mobility (anytime, anywhere access), knowledge availability, social or collaborative capabilities, and customer-centric support.</p><p></p><p>But the consumerization of service isn't only affecting technical service and support organizations; it applies to all corporate service providers. (The "consumerization of HR" exists—Google it.) Soon, other corporate service providers, such as facilities management and legal, will be facing the same challenges and expectations. This trend thankfully overlaps with the growth in enterprise service management.</p><p></p><p><strong>Enterprise service management</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Not only are companies looking to extend ITSM tools and possibly ITIL best practices to other corporate service providers, enabling the company as a whole to benefit from economies of scale and associated cost savings, they're looking to do it in a way that improves the customer experience and meets their consumer-driven expectations.</p><p></p><p>For example <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.kpmg.com/US/en/services/Advisory/management-consulting/management-consulting-by-function/Pages/global-business-services.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KPMG</a>, a global network of professional firms that provides audit, tax, and advisory services, sees a spectrum of states where customers have matured, or wish to mature, from:</p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Decentralized processes within corporate service provider functions, such as IT and HR, performed by business units on their own behalf, to</li><li>Centralized processes, where processes and outcomes are consolidated and owned by centralized service provider functions, with business units as customers, to</li><li>Shared services, where processes are consolidated into regional service entities and operated as business units with shared governance, to</li><li>Global business services, a business services model with global scope and delivery (think global shared services), to</li><li>Integrated multifunctional global business services, which extends the global business services model across multiple corporate service providers, with end-to-end global process ownership and accountability. (In essence, IT, HR, finance, etc., would operate as a single entity, with common tools, processes, and personnel—the nirvana of enterprise service management operations.)</li></ul><p></p><p>The <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDakH14Nmi8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eagle-eyed</a> reader will have noticed that KPMG prefers the term "global business services" to enterprise service management. And if you want an independent definition of enterprise service management it is interesting to note that <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=enterprise+service+management&amp;go=Go" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> is yet to offer one.</p><p></p><p><strong>But other corporate service providers can still benefit from ITSM reimagined as enterprise service management</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>It seems every department in the enterprise is now a service provider. HR, legal, facilities, and others all offer services which can include requests for products, services, information, changes, or assistance with issues, and, ideally, they're delivered via automated workflows.</p><p>Consider HR's "service management," using onboarding a new employee as an example of a complex service request. Traditionally, HR uses email, spreadsheets, or other personal productivity tools to "manage" a number of discrete activities across a number of discrete business functions:</p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>HR: Collecting and verifying employee personal data; signing contracts and other official forms; agreeing to a start date; providing HR policy information; arranging induction training.</li><li>IT: Providing equipment (telephone, laptop, mobile, etc.), software, access to corporate IT services, instructional information, and corporate usage policy information.</li><li>Facilities: Providing suitable working accommodations, a security pass, and network access (in conjunction with IT).</li><li>Fleet: Arranging a company car or a parking space.</li></ul><p></p><p>Yes it all gets delivered, eventually. But how was the service experience? And did it take far longer than it should have done? And undoubtedly something was missed.</p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>So surely our peers in HR would benefit from service management best practices. And surely employees, and other consumers of their services, would benefit from an enterprise approach to service management. Surely all corporate service providers would benefit from the enterprise equivalent of ITIL?</em></strong></p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>Part three of this blog series <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="1148" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="3193" data-objecttype="38" href="/community/learn/blog/2014/06/20/the-future-and-ongoing-relevance-of-itil-part-three-enterprise-service-management-best-practice">The Future And Ongoing Relevance Of ITIL Part Three: Enterprise Service Management Best Practice</a> addresses how ITIL needs to change to meet the challenge of enterprise service management.</p><p></p><p><em>Image source: <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/redvers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Flickr: R/DV/RS' Photostream</a></em></p>
