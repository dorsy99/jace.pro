<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I've written on IT service management (ITSM) metrics before but a recent webinar (the on-demand recording is available <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://info.servicenow.com/LP=2877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>) with colleagues <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-link-profile-small" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="22957" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=4a4f8ea5db181fc09c9ffb651f9619b8">Paul van Nistelrooij</a> and <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-link-profile-small" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="21100" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=e2211a65db981fc09c9ffb651f961990">David van Heusden</a> was a good opportunity to talk to this again.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3383-13043/Picture1.png"><img  alt="Picture1.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="242" src="523d6c8adb58d704ed6af3231f961909.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="485"/></a></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>How are your ITSM metrics?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Most IT organizations have a portfolio of IT and ITSM metrics — a series of best practice critical success factors, key performance indicators (KPIs), and lower-level metrics that are collated and distributed on a regular basis. But:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>How often are metrics tracked merely because of a corporate mandate?</li><li>How much real worth do they add to day-to-day IT operations, to operational and service improvement, or to demonstrating the business value of IT operations? And,</li><li>How often do they unintentionally drive the wrong behaviors or cause IT to focus improvement on the wrong areas?</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">And how important are your metrics?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>The growing importance of IT and ITSM metrics</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">We now work in a world where everyone is talking "value." As in "What value does the IT organization deliver to business operations?", "What's the value of this particular IT service?", or "What value do we get from our annual invest in IT?" But how does an IT organization demonstrate said business value?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">It can become more visible within the organization, it can improve service quality and the service experience, it can better market its services, and it can communicate and re-communicate its successes … BUT to do most of these it will need supporting information, or evidence, to not only understand how well it's actually doing, and to back up claims of successes, but to also determine whether things (such as services, operations, or support and service experience) are optimal or if there is still scope to improve.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Thus, IMO, this somewhat new-found focus on value necessitates IT organizations to revisit their metrics and reporting. So how relevant are your ITSM metrics for 2014 and beyond? How is your metrics thinking? Your perspective? Your metrics hierarchy? And your people and processes?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">How do you fare against the following?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Metrics Thinking</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Think about:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li><strong>If the corporate requirement to "do" metrics overrides the real reasons for having metrics. </strong>This is where we create metrics because we feel that we "should" rather than because we have explicit reasons to capture and analyze data and consider performance against targets. Ask yourself: "Why do we want or need metrics?" Do your metrics deliver against this need? You won't be alone if they don't.</li><li><strong>If your metrics are just targets to be aimed for — so the metrics are the end rather than the means to the end. </strong>The metrics are merely a "corporate game" where all that matters is that you've met or exceeded your targets. Instead, metrics and reporting should see the bigger picture and be an input to, and driver of, improvement.</li><li><strong>If your metrics focus on what IT does rather than what it achieves through what it does. </strong>There is often a disconnect between IT activity and performance, and business objectives, demands, and drivers. Success can also be measured at the wrong point (at IT creation rather than consumption) or through the wrong lens.</li><li><strong>If your metrics and performance could easily be misunderstood. </strong>For instance a reduction in incident volumes is a good thing, right? Not necessarily — a service desk providing a poor level of service might see incident volumes drop as internal customers decide that calling or emailing is futile. Whereas a service desk doing a fantastic job might see an increase in volumes as more users repeatedly reach out for help.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Perspective</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Think about:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li><strong>If you're taking a one-dimensional view of metrics. </strong>For instance, IT organizations can limit themselves to looking at performance in monthly silos — they don't look at the month-on-month, quarter-on-quarter, or even year-on-year trends. So while the IT organization might hit its targets, there might be a serious failure around the corner as performance continues to degrade over time. A failure that could have been preempted.</li><li><strong>If you place too much emphasis on IT benchmarks.</strong> The ability to compare yourself with other IT organizations can help show how fantastic your organization is or to justify spending on improvement. However, benchmark data is often misleading: one might be comparing apples with oranges, where the data doesn't fit your organization. Or benchmark information might be out of date. Plus how many organization choose metrics because they're common or benchmark metrics rather than because they suit the organization's immediate needs?</li><li><strong>If your IT organization has become blinkered by its success against existing metrics. </strong>When your IT organization consistently hits its targets, is the standard response to just increase the target? Instead, consider whether the metrics are still worthwhile — that's whether they still add value to IT and business colleagues. The right action might instead be to remove a particular metric and replace it with one that better reflects current business needs.</li><li><strong>If you aim for, and then reward, failure. </strong>This is setting targets such as 99.9% availability rather than saying "We aim for 100% availability, and we will never go below 99.9%." So in some way, do we sometimes admit defeat before even starting? Or do we actively aim for some semblance of "failure"?</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>The Metrics Hierarchy</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Think about:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><strong>If you have too many metrics. </strong>Most ITSM tools provide a large number of reports and metrics, which can encourage well-meaning IT staff to go for metric quantity over metric quality. And it might also be the easiest things, rather than the most important things, that get measured.</li><li><strong>If you lack structure for, or context between, metrics. </strong>Firstly, metrics or performance management can be stuck in silos rather than being viewed end-to-end across operations and service delivery. And there can also be a lack of correlation and context between different metrics, and how they impact each other. This also links to my one-dimensional and behavioral points.</li><li><strong>If your metric hierarchy isn't clear.</strong> Firstly, not all metrics are born equal —there are differences between metrics, KPIs, critical success factors, and strategic objectives. Plus hitting or failing against a particular single metric might be worse that hitting or failing against half a dozen alternative metrics. Also that metrics need to differentiate between a number of factors, such as hierarchy level, recipients, and their ultimate use. Finally, if your metrics and reporting don't support decision-making, then you're most-likely suffering from one or more of these listed issues.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>People and process</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Think about:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><strong>If your IT organization measures things because they're easy to measure, not because they're important. </strong>Now IT organizations shouldn't spend more time collecting and reporting metrics than the value they get from them, but that still isn't an excuse to just measure the easy stuff. So consider why you report each and every metric in your current reporting pack and assess the value they provide versus the effort required to report them.</li><li><strong>If your metric reporting is poorly designed and delivered. </strong>IT professionals can easily fall into the trap of spending more time collecting metric data than understanding the best way for it to be delivered and consumed. It's similar to communications per se where a message sent doesn't always equate to a message received and understood.</li><li><strong>If you've overlooked the behavioral aspects of metrics. </strong>Do your metrics drive behaviors and decisions that are good for IT but detrimental at a bigger-picture, business level? At a team or individual level, do your metrics drive the wrong attitudes and behaviors? With particular metrics making individuals act for personal rather than corporate success? Metrics can also conflict and pull IT staff in different directions.</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em>So how did you fare?
