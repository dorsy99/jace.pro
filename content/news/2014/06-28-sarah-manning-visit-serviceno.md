As technologies and expectations advance, the concept is now broader and has implications beyond just managing a mobile strategy or a BYOD approach. Employees are enjoying a better service experience in their personal lives - one that includes ease-of-use, self-service, anytime and anyplace access, social or collaborative capabilities, and customer-centric support.   Thus the real challenge for enterprise IT organizations is not the Consumerization of IT, it's the Consumerization of Enterprise Services. </em></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> <span style="line-height: 1.5em; color: #515151; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Join the presentation on Fermilab's IT organization's journey to achieving service delivery excellence for thousands staff and visiting scientists.

Serving 4,480 constituents, IT struggled with a vast network of devices and applications, making it impossible to keep track of data source and configuration items. Learn how ORNL adopted a new Discovery and CMBD technology to form a solid foundation, firmly rooted in a vision to transformation IT with a single system of record for automating service management and delivery — not just within IT but organization-wide. You'll hear Brian Arlington discuss the IT journey through Discovery and IT service management, which is culminating into a new shared services approach offering employees a 1-stop shop experience.   Brian will outline the approach ORNL lab has taken to create a service-oriented enterprise. Regardless of the need, question, request or issue — spanning anything from HR and facilities to requests for equipment or services — Brian will review the processes and technology in place to effectively manage and automate the delivery of service relationships.</em></p><p><em>For more, <a title="w.servicenow.com/customers/oak_ridge_national_laboratory.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/customers/oak_ridge_national_laboratory.html">read the Oak Ridge National Lab's success stories</a>.</em></p><p></p><p>Steven Raley, <a title="w.servicenow.com/customers/oak_ridge_national_laboratory.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/customers/oak_ridge_national_laboratory.html">Oak Ridge National Lab</a> is also speaking o<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">n <strong>Tuesday, July 1 from 2:00-3:00pm</strong> in <strong>Regency B</strong> for a Birds of a Feather session on <strong>ServiceNow Successes</strong>. </span></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Connect with us &amp; stay informed!</strong></p><ul><li>Follow <a title="witter.com/servicenow" href="https://twitter.com/servicenow">@ServiceNow</a> on Twitter</li><li>Chat using the <a title="witter.com/hashtag/nlit" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlit">#NLIT</a> and <a title="witter.com/hashtag/servicenow" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/servicenow">#ServiceNow</a> hashtags</li><li>Post a <a title="agboard.com/ServiceNowSelfie" href="https://tagboard.com/ServiceNowSelfie">#ServiceNowSelfie</a> when you visit the booth — you just might make the <a title="ww.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152557514047573.1073741839.70876467572&type=3" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152557514047573.1073741839.70876467572&amp;type=3">Facebook album</a>!</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><img  alt="SN-K14_4798.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="70a7c982dbd897041dcaf3231f9619ed.iix" style="height: 413px; width: 620px;"/></p>
