<p>Are the emails sent from your instance constantly being blocked by your company's mail server? Do you find yourself <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/service-catalog/blog/2015/11/24/video-my-ip-information">hunting down IP addresses</a> to whitelist to your server? Simplify your life by configuring mail delivery using ServiceNow's Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records. This is the best way to ensure your company's email server continues to receive emails from your instance.</p><p></p><p>SPF records assist with spam detection and allow your company to choose which mail sources are domain friendly, and which ones are not. The advantage of using ServiceNow SPF records (as opposed to whitelisting these IP addresses manually) is that it is dynamic; once you configure the SPF records with your mail server, your records stay up to date, even if your instance moves to another datacenter or the IP addresses change.</p><p></p><p>Before configuring, make sure your email infrastructure is up to industry standards.
