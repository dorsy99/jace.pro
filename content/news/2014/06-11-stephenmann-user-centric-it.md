<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">You might have recently seen some PR about a "movement" called <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://usercentricit.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">User-Centric IT</a>. From what I can tell about ownership and the driving forces, it's a collaboration of a number of software vendors including: Box, GoodData, Jive, Marketo, Okta, Skyhigh, and Zendesk. It might be an Agile Manifesto for IT service delivery?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">It's a beautifully designed website but, more importantly, it offers up all sorts of advice from the Principles of User-Centric IT through to a User-Centric IT kit. It has to be applauded, and admired, but IMO there is a big BUT, well two big BUTs. Probably because I've been on the IT service management (ITSM) side of the house for too long and sheep-dipped into ITIL.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">So bear with me as I share by big BUTs, I'm not a hater.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>BUT #1: "user" sounds so 1990s</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Yes the customers or consumers of corporate technology use the technology or IT services but should we still call them "users"? Personally I don't think so. In fact, it should be a word avoided by the internal IT organization. To me its use smacks of <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Six_(The_Prisoner)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Number Six</a> and <em>"I am not a number, I am a free man."</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Unfortunately we can debate all day as to whether the consumers of corporate IT services are users, end users, business users, business colleagues, consumers, customers, or another alternative. But I think "users" is such a bad term to use for the people that ultimately pay the wages of the people that work in IT. Or are secondary contributors if you want to think of external customers as the people who ultimately pay the wages (and of course these can get called users too).</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I know why people like the term "user" — as the consumer of the IT service doesn't directly pay for it (even with chargeback). But think about a restaurant, and its staff, that only calls the person who pays the bill a customer and everyone else at the table an "eater." IMO the term user should have been left in the last millennium along with the Y2K bug.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>BUT #2: what happened to 25 years of ITIL and IT services?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong> </strong>  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">And by IT services I mean the mechanism by which customers/users consume IT; so not network services, storage services, etc.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The landing page offers an interesting diagram, a diagram that I've copied below (assuming it is sharable under creative commons, and that I'll be corrected if otherwise):</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3157-10717/Screen Shot 2014-06-10 at 17.48.14.png"><img  alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-10 at 17.48.14.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="553" src="ff60108edb9417049c9ffb651f96190c.iix" style="height: 380px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="903"/></a>Source: <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://usercentricit.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://usercentricit.com/</a></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Again it's beautiful and obviously the hard work of a number of clever people. But look at the center of the concentric circles and then go out one ring. You have: devices, ID, and location. You can probably guess my second big BUT by now — where is the services layer? Sure that's what's really important to the user/customer (maybe other than a sexy mobile device) — they are consuming a service that helps them to do their job, they most likely don't care about what hides behind IT's velvet curtain.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">However what I do like about the diagram, or my interpretation of it, is that all of the layers and their elements are focused on the consumer(s) of IT services. As I said I'm not a hater.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>So what's my point?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">And why am I being such a <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Whinging%20Pom" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">whinging pom</a>?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I'm just a little bemused that, while the companies involved in User-Centric IT are the some of the leading lights in modern enterprise software or software-as-a-service (SaaS), they haven't played to and encouraged others to focus on my two big BUTs. After all they succeed not only based on their great software/SaaS (and its customer-centric design) but also their great customer support and customer service.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">So for me it's a great idea that missed an opportunity in execution. I like it but I could like, and believe in, it so much more.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em>Anyways, it's just my two cents.
