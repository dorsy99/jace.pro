<p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Last year, we celebrated the first edition of CreateNow Hackathon, allowing anyone to form a team and explore the limits of what can be created on the ServiceNow platform. Among the contenders was a team called <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/blog/2013/05/14/1285">The Leftovers</a>. They consisted of four members from all around the world who had just showed up, formed a team and entered the competition. They didn't came through to the finals, but they did create a functioning app in less than a day. And surely, 3 out of the 4 of them returned for the <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/hackathon.html" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/hackathon.html">Knowledge14 Hackathon</a>, which has attracted 10x the number of registrations compared to last year. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><img  alt="MarkusSchär_3.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="8b728086db1c5704ed6af3231f9619cb.iix" style="height: auto; float: right;"/><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=9a9f862ddb181fc09c9ffb651f9619bc">Markus Schär</a>, who is an ITSM Consultant at <a title="w.devoteam.ch/de/start.aspx" href="http://www.devoteam.ch/de/start.aspx">Devoteam</a> in Switzerland, is one of last year's Leftovers. I sat down with him to talk about appdev, Knowledge and the Hackathon that will kick-off tomorrow at 3:40pm in the Moscone Center here in San Francisco. He came back for the cup.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><em style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri;">- So Markus, thanks for being back. Why did you decide to participate in the Hackathon again, this year?</em><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri;"> <br/></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">Well, last year was an excellent experience. I love developing on the ServiceNow platform, so when I learned that I could go to Knowledge again, I didn't hesitate and registered for the Hackathon again. </span></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><em style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">- Smart decision! So after Knowledge13, did you go on to develop some apps back at home, for customers maybe?</em><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> <br/>I did! I actually developed a pretty big and complex application for <a title="w.connectis.ch/en.html" href="http://www.connectis.ch/en.html">connectis AG</a>, a local Managed Service Provider in Switzerland, focused on Communication and Collaboration Services. Two of my connectis clients are actually here at K14. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><em style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">- Nice work. So what can you tell us about the app you developed for them.</em><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> <br/>The application enables automation of the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) process — both on the intake of broken goods, as on the interaction with the manufacturer. Once we had nailed the process for their customer A, connectis also wanted it for their other customers — based on the same framework, but with additional improvements. It is a great app, because its integrated with ServiceNow Asset Management, which gives connectis a full overview of assets, tracks broken parts and units, backed up by a full order history per vendor. Before, that whole process had media breaks between the former ITSM tool, email, excel and phone calls. Now, it is standardized, predictable and much more efficient. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><em style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">- That sounds great — so you'll probably make it available in the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/share">SHARE section</a> of the ServiceNow Community, won't you? <br/></em><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Who knows! We first have to finish it, and it is quite a specific app, with highly configured features for this particular customer — but really: who knows? I think it would be great to have a portal to exchange apps.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><em style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">- So, are you entering the Hackathon on your own again, or did you bring a team this time around?</em><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> <br/>I brought a team, actually! We are the Devoteam Hackathon Team, so DevHTeam, consisting of <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=60531269db1c1fc09c9ffb651f9619ca">David Legrand</a> and <a title="ww.linkedin.com/pub/yves-lavalette/16/81a/a43" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/yves-lavalette/16/81a/a43">Yves Lavalette</a> of Devoteam France, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=97119a25db981fc09c9ffb651f9619f7">Jürgen Werkmann</a> (Devoteam Germany), <a title=".linkedin.com/pub/michael-rotbøll-sjøgreen/0/775/225" href="http://dk.linkedin.com/pub/michael-rotbøll-sjøgreen/0/775/225">Michael Rotbøll Sjøgreen</a> of our customer Saxo Bank Denmark. And myself, of course.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 14pt;"><em style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">- Good stuff — so what are you guys building this year?</em><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> <br/>We're still playing with a couple of ideas. Maybe a Worldcup App to enable people to bet on the games. But if we come up with other ideas, that's fine. It is a Hackathon, right — so anything goes!</span></p><p><em style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Have blast, guys — and good luck creating!</em></p>
