<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">From speaking to Doug Schulze recently, I realized that sometimes people want to see a list of unique IP addresses that Discovery has found in their environment. Unfortunately the way the IP address table (cmdb_ci_ip_address) is designed doesn't allow you to see that. Instead, you'll find a lot of IP address records that have the exact same IP address (seemingly duplicates). This is because when this was designed, each NIC (network adapter) had its own set of IP addresses. As DHCP starts assigning out different addresses over time, different computer could potentially own some of the same addresses at different points in time. I think there's probably some cleanup work that can be done in this area. However, with the proper filter, you can still look at all the active unique IP addresses out there. </span></p><p> </p><p> <span style="color: #2b29ee; font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; text-decoration: underline;"><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://YOUR-INSTANCE-NAME.service-now.com/cmdb_ci_ip_address_list.do?sysparm_query=nic.install_status!%3D100%5Einstall_status%3D1&amp;sysparm_view=" rel="nofollow">https://YOUR-INSTANCE-NAME.service-now.com/cmdb_ci_ip_address_list.do?sysparm_query=nic.install_status!%3D100%5Einstall_status%3D1&amp;sysparm_view=</a></span></p><p> </p><p> <span style="font-family: Arial;">With this filter, you can quickly see which IP belongs to what computer. And as you might expect, it's only as fresh as the last Discovery run. <span __jive_emoticon_name="happy" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_macro jive_emote" src="/6.0.3.0/images/emoticons/happy.png"></span></span></p>
