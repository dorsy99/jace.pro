<p>I recently did a presentation to some colleagues on what I perceived to be the current CIO challenges and trends and, in doing so, I created a list of things based on what I was hearing, seeing, and reading about. But a list of CIO challenges seemed too one-dimensional, particularly in light of my view that CIO, or IT, priorities have changed little over the last 5 years — what I call the "aspiration to action gap" — you can read about it <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="" href="/community/learn/blog/2014/03/31/2014-it-priorities-the-aspiration-to-action-gap">here</a>.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>But the CIO challenges, IMO, have changed dramatically — which is odd if the IT priorities haven't. And they still fit into <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/stephen_mann/12-12-24-the_top_10_it_service_management_challenges_for_2013_but_what_did_you_achieve_in_2012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three high-level "challenge groupings" I imagined-up whilst working at Forrester</a> (although I appreciate that we can all be limited by our own imaginations):</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Increased business scrutiny.</li><li>Increased business and customer expectations.</li><li>Increased business and IT complexity.</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>The Evolution Of CIO and IT Challenges</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>In the end I decided it would be fun to not only show the current challenges but also how they have evolved over time. And please remember that this is purely my opinion — no statistics were harmed in writing this blog.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>The * denotes that the previous challenge is still relevant.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increased Business Scrutiny</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol><li>Do more with less &gt; Deliver more with less* &gt; Reduce costs AND improve service (<em>although see #2</em>)</li><li>Reduce costs* &gt; Improve efficiency* &gt; Demonstrate business value</li><li>We need governance &gt; We need better governance* &gt; Help, we need governance</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increased Business &amp; IT Complexity</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Achieve IT to Business alignment &gt; Understand more about the business* &gt; Be part of business operations</li><li>Manage technology domains &gt; Manage IT services* &gt; Manage multi-supplier sourcing scenarios (which includes outsourcing, SaaS, and cloud)</li><li>"Command and control" IT &gt; Business function IT development &gt; "Shadow IT" (especially "unsanctioned" cloud adoption)</li><li>"Keep the lights on" &gt; Innovation* &gt; Support growth and competitive advantage (increase the 20 in the 80:20 spend profile)</li><li><em>Technology complexity and opportunity:</em> Mainframe &gt; Client server &gt; Web, mobile, social, "Big Data," cloud, and BYOD</li><li>Build IT infrastructure &gt; Maintain legacy infrastructure* &gt; Source third-party infrastructure services</li><li>Build applications* &gt; Application rationalization* &gt; Build mobile apps</li><li>Skill shortages &gt; People shortages* &gt; New skill shortages (to manage services) and embracing the rise of automation</li><li><em>One song remains the same:</em> Security &gt; Security &gt; Security</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>And I deliberately moved the first four bullets to the top of the list to highlight the importance of IT management challenges over IT.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increased Business &amp; Customer Expectations</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Customer satisfaction &gt; User experience &gt; Service experience (consumerization)</li><li><em>CIO role:</em> IT visionary &gt; Infrastructure custodian &gt; IT/CIO relevancy/irrelevancy based on what they do now and plan for later</li><li>Need for IT &gt; Need for more IT* &gt; Need for speed (agility)</li><li>Support multi-site operations &gt; Support global operations &gt; Support anytime, anyplace, anywhere operations (mobility)</li><li>Knowledge retention &gt; Knowledge management* &gt; Knowledge exploitation, community, and collaboration</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>So that's my list and, like <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marmite</a> you might love it or loathe it. But I believe it's healthy to put your opinions "out there" whether they are fully formed (that's my polite way of saying that we are not always correct) or not.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Finally, if you are at the <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.hdiconference.com/default" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2014 HDI Conference in Orlando this week</a> and fancy a chat, look out for a chubby Englishman most-likely holding a treasure chest by the ServiceNow booth (BTW it's not me in the photo).</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2945-8857/IMG_2544.JPG"><img  alt="IMG_2544.JPG" class="image-0 jive-image" height="900" src="7ca3958edb10d7041dcaf3231f961961.iix" style="height: 465px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="1200"/></a></p>
