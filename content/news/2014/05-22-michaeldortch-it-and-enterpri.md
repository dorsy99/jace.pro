<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">So what did YOU do after Knowledge14?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><br/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Many if not most of us on the ServiceNow Knowledge14 team took much-needed breaks. My wife and I went on our first "laptop-free" vacation in more than three years, to Switzerland, France and Ireland.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><br/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">(While in "the neighborhood," I did have a tour of much-celebrated research facility and ServiceNow client <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/customers/cern.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CERN</a>. I also had the pleasure of lunch with <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-link-profile-small" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="3582" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=11c1deaddb981fc09c9ffb651f961904">Reinoud Martens</a>, our "champion-in-chief" there, and two of his colleagues. But that was strictly a social call — Reinoud even arranged my tour and paid for lunch. Many thanks, Reinoud!)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><br/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Despite my concerted efforts to avoid work while vacationing, however, my mind kept going back to Knowledge14. And it occurred to me that while for me such thoughts were framed as looks back, similar thoughts are very likely looks forward for many if not most of you who attended Knowledge14.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><br/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Why? Because you can now start putting to work all of the things you learned and connections you made at and during Knowledge14. You've probably already downloaded the presentations from your top sessions and started sharing them with colleagues. Maybe you've even already arranged those first follow-up meals, meetings or calls with those cool people you met.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><br/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Call it the Knowledge Effect. You spend a few days with thousands of your colleagues, partners and peers at Knowledge14. You check out familiar and new-to-you ServiceNow partners and their offerings. You get "sneak peeks" at upcoming ServiceNow features and solutions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><br/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">You go back to work sometime soon after Knowledge14 (break optional), brimming with ideas you carefully winnow into an achievable short list. Then you begin reaching out, planning, prioritizing — making things happen. By Knowledge15, you've put some of those ideas into action, and you're ready to share what you've learned and to learn more. And it all begins again. It's the polar opposite of a vicious cycle — it's a virtuous circle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 'ï¼­ï¼³ æ˜Žæœ�'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">On the flight from Ireland back to the US, I read through the May 17/18 issue of "FT Weekend Magazine." In a column entitled "<a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/0984784c-da34-11e3-920f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz32O398IEf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">How can we improve our wellbeing?</a>" psychotherapist Antonia Macaro lists the New Economics Foundation's "Five Ways to Well-being." "They are: connect, be active, take notice (or be aware of yourself and the world), keep learning and give." All of which, I maintain, Knowledge conferences help all who attend to do, in one form or another. Which can make for greater wellbeing, professionally and personally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 'ï¼­ï¼³ æ˜Žæœ�'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 'ï¼­ï¼³ æ˜Žæœ�'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">Want a quick refresher of some of the high points of Knowledge14?
