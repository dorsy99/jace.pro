<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On July 31, ServiceNow hosted a <a href="https://www.crowdchat.net/transformit"><span style="color: #0000ff;">#TransformIT</span></a> chat along with KPMG focused on changing the way work gets done in an enterprise. Conversation centered on disruptive technologies, killing email, and evolving IT roles — especially those of the C-Suite. (See the transcript of the chat <a href="https://www.crowdchat.net/transformit"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a>.)</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Participants agreed: In order to embrace change and facilitate growth, IT must accept its role as a crucial component of the business — rather than simply a provider of technology services. Enterprise service management hinges on this transformation of IT — and its leaders' ability to adapt.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><img   alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-11 at 3.34.35 PM.JPG" class="image-0 jive-image" src="1ea15d86db94d344e9737a9e0f9619db.iix" style="height: 102px; width: 620px;"/><br/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background: white;"><strong>Kill Email?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; background: white;">One question presented to panelists asked whether email was the culprit in preventing companies from getting their internal services automated. A bevy of opinions from participants generally agreed that email is not optimized for service requests. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a href="https://twitter.com/sitare21"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Farah Remtulla</span></a><span style="background: #F1F1F1;"> of KPMG said that if you can demonstrate to your business that using an automated method to achieve the same task is more efficient, people will be more willing to let it go.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Participant <a href="https://twitter.com/CopelandNatalya"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Natalya Copeland</span></a> opined,<span style="background: #F1F1F1;"> "I don't think people want to get rid of the human side of email, they just want to make service requests as efficient as possible."</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Evolution of IT's Role</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Whether or not email is truly on its deathbed, one thing is clear among participants: Rather than how, it's a matter of when IT automation will shift from alignment to integration with the business. As CIO/CTO expert <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterKretzman"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Peter Kretzman</span></a> stated, "How could IT ever <em>stop</em> evolving? The bar keeps getting raised, and expectations get even higher."</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The C-Suite will of course need to address the effects of such an evolution. Participants agreed that service automation positively influences the role of the CIO with improved tracking and measurement, free time and resources to focus on strategy, and greater productivity.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">One thing became apparent as discussion continued, and <span style="background: #F5F8FA;">IT Management Consultant </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ITSMPundit"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Shane Carlson</span></a> laid it out: IT is being pulled to the executive table at a rate we have not seen previously, and the opportunity to automate and enable with an enterprise platform is huge.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><img   alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-11 at 4.02.03 PM.JPG" class="image-1 jive-image" src="0051f08adb1cd704ed6af3231f9619e8.iix" style="height: 72px; width: 620px;"/><br/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Millennials are Behind the Wheel</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">So how quickly will it change? According to participants, the impact of millennials will be great. Give millennials the same automated ease they experience in their personal life at work, said <a href="https://twitter.com/Rebert512"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rina Ebert</span></a> of KPMG, and you can change culture quickly. Added Shane Carlson, email to a millennial is like the pony express was to the telegraph and the fax was to the email generation. Millennials choose when, how, and what devices they use for work and play. They will find a way to make something better or do it in a manner that suits their lifestyle. Impatient yet efficient, the new age worker is key to improving how we use technology. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>The New CIO</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So what do you think? Who is the New CIO?
