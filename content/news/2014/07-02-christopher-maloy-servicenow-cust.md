<p>Today's post is a short one.   I recently ran into an issue where I was creating a custom workflow activity and wanting to use the dynamic variable syntax to submit data on the fly - when the workflow runs.   Normally to do this in a workflow you would use the dollar sign bracket syntax ${variableName}, but for some reason the actual string ${variableName} was getting submitted and not replaced with my variable value.</p><p></p><p>Lucky for me I have friends in high places.   I reached out to one of our amazing developers, @Jesse Schulman and asked him what was going on.   What I learned is that a workflow activity uses a base class function call that calls into the JSUtils.strEval function to replace those dynamic variables with the variable values at runtime. </p><p></p><p>You don't really have to remember all of that.   The important thing is that you dereference the variable in the activity using this syntax:</p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">this.js(activity.vars.variableName)</span></p><p></p><p>That is it.   This will make sure that you can use dynamic variables in a custom workflow activity field.   Cheers.</p>
