In reality, however, that is never true.</p><p>In simple terms, we like to use this play on words, "It all starts with the map".</p><p></p><p>Our ServiceWatch software automates mapping of IT infrastructure to business services in order to deliver unified IT performance management. So, for us, "it" and "IT" all starts with the map.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, our innovative approach stands out by providing results 20 times faster and 80% lower cost than traditional approaches. And, on the other hand, ServiceWatch fits in by integrating with other monitoring, event management and application performance management tools, plus widely-used system and application software, as well as   CMDB (configuration management database) software. </p><p></p><p>If you are using CMDB software, we automate the process of building service models that can be used to populate the CMDB — enhancing your investment in the CMDB.</p><p></p><p>And, if you've got monitoring software in place (we don't know anyone who doesn't), we enhance your investment in those — even those of you who have deployed application monitoring performance tools. <span style="line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 12pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/servicewatch.html"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">ServiceWatch</span></a></span> is able to receive events and put those in the context of service impacts to help improve uptime and mean time to repair (MTTR).</p><p></p><p>Now, let's try again, do you already have a tool that does all that?</p>
