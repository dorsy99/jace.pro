<p><img   alt="June 2014 ACI.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="3a8f7b3ddb18d3049c9ffb651f9619bb.iix" style="height: auto; float: right;"/>This month, application creators convened, conversed, and pushed the ACI back to levels not seen since March. The index gained 4.7% during a time when the broader S&amp;P 500 index gained 2.1%.</p><p></p><p>The increase can mostly be attributed to rising stock prices and new investment in cloud platforms. One example is the Apache Foundation's promotion of <a title="w.zdnet.com/apache-makes-stratos-paas-cloud-a-top-level-project-7000030179/" href="http://www.zdnet.com/apache-makes-stratos-paas-cloud-a-top-level-project-7000030179/">Stratos</a>, its PaaS environment, to Top-Level Project status. Stratos will struggle to establish an identify distinct from myriad other, similar open source app platforms including OpenStack and CloudStack but that's less significant than the message it sends: app creation and app lifecycle ownership continue to dominate the CIO board room agenda.</p><p></p><p>Endless banter about <a title="w.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2014/jun/23/saas-adoption-ploughs-while-iaas-and-paas-reach-tipping-point-research-shows/" href="http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2014/jun/23/saas-adoption-ploughs-while-iaas-and-paas-reach-tipping-point-research-shows/">new data on PaaS adoption</a> from North Bridge Venture Partners also contributed to ACI's increase. It included these compelling stats (sample size: 1,358 respondents): PaaS enterprise adoption will increase to 41% this year while SaaS adoption will grow to 74%.</p><p></p><p>ACI's 4.7% jump in June is impressive since it's one of the quietest months for M&amp;A and industry events. Expect more meandering upward through September then a surge as we enter the last quarter of 2014.</p>
