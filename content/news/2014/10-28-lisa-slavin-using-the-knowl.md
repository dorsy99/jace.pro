<p>In a recent blog post, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/groups/servicenow-user-group-sig-knowledge-management/blog/2014/07/30/interactive-demos-in-servicenow-s-knowledge-base">Interactive Demos In ServiceNow's Knowledge Base</a>, I introduced how and why ServiceNow's Training Operations team embeds interactive demos in knowledge articles for internal training purposes. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Now, I would like to share other ways the Training Operation team utilizes the Knowledge Base to disseminate information about training opportunities and training content.</span></p><p></p><h2>Using the KB to disseminate information about training opportunities</h2><p></p><h3>Landing Pages</h3><p>The Training Operations landing page provides:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Department overview of what we offer our employees</li><li>The internal instructor led training schedule for each quarter</li><li>Frequently asked training questions, like: <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">How do I register for training? W</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">hat is eLearning or Web-based training?</span></li><li>An introduction to the training operations team, so folks can see who their upcoming instructor is or who to contact if they need support developing training content.</li></ul><p>Please reference, <em><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=872dc3a9db9cdbc01dcaf3231f9619bf">Landing Pages- Why and How</a></em>, by <a __default_attr="19635" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro_user jive_macro" data-orig-content="servicenowkevin, " href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=48e0de21db981fc09c9ffb651f96196f" modifiedtitle="true" title="servicenowkevin, ">servicenowkevin, </a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">which provides the basic code for building a landing page.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><img   alt="landing page.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" src="be5b554edb9c9f048c8ef4621f961929.iix" style="height: 397px; width: 620px;"/><br/></span></p><p></p><h3>Course Catalog</h3><p>Linked to the Training Operations landing page, this knowledge article includes a list of courses owned and administered by Training Operations. There is an outline, detailed description, and requirements for each course.</p><p><img   alt="course catalogue.jpg" class="jive-image image-3" src="23673846db5cdfc068c1fb651f961959.iix" style="height: 386px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><h3>New Hire Training and Requirements Landing Page</h3><p>This article is a central repository of information and activities for new hires, focusing on their technical role at ServiceNow. Each department has their own new hire article. Here, the new hire can read:</p><ul><li>A<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">list of action items to complete (like getting access credentials)</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Instructor led trainings they need to register for</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Standard operating procedures to review</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Web based training to watch, which is designed to familiarize them with ServiceNow product and culture</span></li></ul><p><img   alt="new hire.jpg" class="jive-image image-4" src="d4679402dbd817041dcaf3231f9619d3.iix" style="height: 327px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><h3>Directions on Access The Learning Management System (LMS)</h3><p>ServiceNow adopted a Learning Management System that hosts web based training. To teach employee how to access this LMS and register for training, we wrote a KB article with instructions and accompanying images. Â  Whenever we announce or assign a new web based training in the LMS, we always link to this article as a reference.</p><p><img   alt="access portal.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="e757d002dbd817041dcaf3231f96197d.iix" style="height: 343px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><h2>Using the KB as a tool to host training</h2><p></p><h3>Embedded Web Based Training (WBT)</h3><p>Prior to having a LMS, we would embed WBT (produced in <a title="ww.articulate.com/products/storyline-why.php" href="https://www.articulate.com/products/storyline-why.php">Storyline</a>) in a knowledge article. Please reference the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/groups/servicenow-user-group-sig-knowledge-management/blog/2014/07/30/interactive-demos-in-servicenow-s-knowledge-base">Interactive Demo post</a> for directions and tools of how this is accomplished.</p><p><img   alt="wbt.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="275b5986db1cd344e9737a9e0f961932.iix" style="height: 342px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><h3>Embed Assessment</h3><p>Often we work with internal teams who write very long articles outlining work instructions, process steps, and policies. Managers needed to know that their employees read the instructions and understand the content. To test if knowledge transfer occurred, we embed a scenario based assessment in the article. After reading the article the employee takes the assessment to test their comprehension of the material. When they pass this assessment with a predefined score, the employee is presented with a certificate they then email their manager.</p><p></p><p>There are two different ways we have executed this:</p><ul><li>Using the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/support/business-edition/blog/2014/09/17/creating-a-custom-survey">Survey Management </a>application.</li><li>Embedding an assessment in the article, following the directions in the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/groups/servicenow-user-group-sig-knowledge-management/blog/2014/07/30/interactive-demos-in-servicenow-s-knowledge-base">Interactive Demo post</a>.</li></ul><p><img   alt="assessmet.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="6f57737ddb90d3049c9ffb651f961937.iix" style="height: 323px; width: 620px;"/></p><h3></h3><h3>Use Cases</h3><p>To help employees apply work instruction to their everyday role and recall real-work scenarios, we frequently include use cases (either in the same KB article as the work instruction or in a stand-alone article) that list out, step-by-step, how the employee will perform a certain task following the work instructions.</p><p><img   alt="use case.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="6a573f75db90d3041dcaf3231f961925.iix" style="height: 312px; width: 620px; float: none;"/></p><p></p><h2>How do you use knowledge management to disseminate training or enhance learning?</h2><p>Please share your feedback in the comments sections below.</p>
