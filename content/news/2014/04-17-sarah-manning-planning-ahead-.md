First, let me tell you a little bit about me. As the IT Service Controls Manager for Parsons Brinckerhoff, I perform two key roles - I am accountable for the creation and continual improvement of all global IT Service Management processes and am also the owner of our ServiceNow implementation. I have been with my company for a little over a year and this is my first exposure to ServiceNow in my career. My role as ServiceNow owner entails setting the strategy and timeline for our implementation, but we wouldn't be where we are today without the help of our developer extraordinaire Michael Carpenter (</span><a href="file://localhost/javascript/%3B"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Carpenter</span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">) </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">While this is the second Knowledge conference I'll be attending, for all intents and purposes it is really my first. When I attended K13 last year, I had only been with my company for a month and was still getting a grasp of what ServiceNow was along with our implementation of it. After attending K13, I walked away amazed at what this solution can do. Since then, we've been busy planning our roadmap and have rolled out a Change Management process, a Knowledge Management process, a CMS-based Self Service Portal, a refreshed Service Catalog and many other minor enhancements. While I view these as great accomplishments, I am even more excited about our future plans. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">My goal for Knowledge14 is to be a sponge and absorb as much as I possibly can, but with that said here are my main areas of focus:</span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Expanding use of ServiceNow beyond the core ITSM processes</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">How to leverage ServiceNow's social features across our enterprise</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Best practices for IT Asset Management &amp; Configuration Management</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Creative approaches for Knowledge Management </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">And most importantly - Networking!</span></li></ul><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">If you are on the fence about registering, take a few minutes to read this blog containing </span><a _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/blog/2014/04/11/know14-is-the-place-to-be-customer-insights"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">customer insights</span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I look forward to seeing everyone at #Know14 â€” The place to be!</span></p>
