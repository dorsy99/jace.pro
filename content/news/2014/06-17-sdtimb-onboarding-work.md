<p>[due to the size of the workflows, the images may be difficult to read.

However, as the business grew, ServiceNow extended to our global locations, and IT transitioned from a semi-fragmented organization towards a centralized model, we quickly outgrew our original design.   After several revisions to the Onboarding process, both in ServiceNow and our internal HR processes, I have ended up with an Onboarding process that is very functional and extremely flexible to change. Our basic Onboarding process is as follows:</p><p></p><p>-- Human Resources interviews and selects a candidate. After the offerletter is accepted;</p><p>         -- The hiring manager completes the Onboarding form via the ESS. (previously, a paper form was filled out by the hiring manager, given to HR, HR would review, if everything looked good HR would then translate the information from the paper form into the ServiceNow onboarding form (madness). This is because we were lacking an approval process in the ServiceNow workflow)</p><p>         -- An approval email is sent to the Human Resources representative(s) at the new employees location</p><p>         -- Upon reviewing the Approval Email, which contains information from the Onboarding form about the new employee, the request is either Approved or Rejected*</p><p>         -- Based on the selections / information entered by the hiring manager, Catalog Tasks are created and email Notifications are sent. This allows us to trigger activities, not only to Process Users (solely IT in our environment), but also members of the business.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*Approvals are very rarely rejected, only in cases when HR was not aware of the new hire. For corrections to the information entered by the hiring manager (title, start date, etc.), a mail script captures the body of the approval email and enters it in a "HR Approval Comments" variable on the Catalog Request &amp; Catalog Tasks. This also eliminated the need to purchase additional Process User licensing, and train Human Resources in another system when minor details needed to be corrected.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="OnboardingForm.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="139214cedbd01f048c8ef4621f961908.iix" style="height: 717px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p><img   alt="Onboarding_Main.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="2242bf31dbdc1fc03eb27a9e0f96197d.iix" style="height: 613px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p><img   alt="Onboarding_Irvine.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" src="e821698edb9cd344e9737a9e0f96195e.iix" style="height: 473px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="OnboardingTasks.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="69db7842dbdcdfc068c1fb651f961990.iix" style="height: 155px; width: 620px;"/></p>
