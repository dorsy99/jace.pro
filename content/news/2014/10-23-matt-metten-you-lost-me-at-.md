Heck, they might even add an exclamation point and switch it up a bit with "Hi, {First Name}!" I know, crazy talk.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Yes, I'm being facetious, but the reality is time is not being spent within the organizational experience to elevate and personalize and it is the one area of a person's web experience that can be THE MOST custom. With a logged in user navigating your portal/hub/iNet/whatever, you have the ability to tap in to so much more about the person visiting your site.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><h2>What if when you visited your site...</h2><ul><li>there is a slider showing announcements, but the graphics of that slider are unique to your area of the world and the announcements only pertain to the groups/role you are a part of?</li><li>you could select a theme that you prefer and so, even visually, it can be more accommodating?</li><li>it knows that you have mainly visited these 6 sections so your primary navigation menu is just those 6 things?</li><li>you see articles and links and PDFs and services and action items that others don't, but it's not only due to your role, it's because of what we think you'll use the most or have used the most?</li><li>you could access all the links and pages and valuable items you've discovered and "keep" them in an area just for you? How much quicker would that be for you the next time you visit?</li><li>only the catalog items configured for your specific office were served up so there is absolutely no confusion as to what you should order?</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>You can. And you should! This type of personalization is happening on pretty much every public website you can imagine, but they are limited to previous movement you have made. If you clicked on this link they bet you'd like that link. If you are from this part of the world, they serve up that image or ad. And so on.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>The ESM organization has the ability to make the user experience so useful, so custom, and so enjoyable that you can't help but come back. You will use that tool/site/portal/hub/whatever and continue to do so. The power of the ServiceNow platform makes this type of effort a no-brainer.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>One reason why you don't see personalization happening as much is that it does take effort; sustained, consistent effort. You can't just create that one slider graphic and mark your task complete; you have to think through the larger enterprise value of customization. However, you marry the creation of an announcement with the backend power of a workflow and now you've harnessed automation to do the heavy lifting for you. Now it all starts to work together and work harder for you, all while making the end user feel more valued in their experience.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>Too much work is being done within the ESM organization to not take greater advantage of building powerful, personalized websites. You have the tools (ServiceNow), you have the data (more than you probably need), now you just need the commitment. Your employees with thank you. Your fulfillers will thank you. Your investment will be greatly rewarded.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p><strong>Why do you think organizations aren't utilizing personalization more?</strong> Would love to hear your comments below or <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/mattmetten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tweet me</a> and we can chat more.</p>
