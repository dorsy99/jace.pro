<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">At Knowledge14 I was lucky enough to moderate three customer panel sessions related to implementation success. As I wrote in a previous <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2798" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="2993" data-objecttype="38" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/blog/2014/04/15/want-service-management-success-look-to-your-peers">blog</a>:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em>"Implementation is such a key area, I think most of us know that just systematically swapping one technology solution for another doesn't necessarily guarantee any form of improvement let alone tangible success such as improved efficiency, reduced costs, or better service and service experience. After all, delivering new service management technology, new or improved processes, and the associated people change isn't easy. Especially where that change might go beyond IT and IT service management (ITSM) to improve enterprise-wide service delivery, e.g. HR or facilities, and maybe to cater for multi-supplier sourcing environments.</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em> </em>  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em>And that change or transformation isn't in a vacuum. There's no doubt in my mind that the management of IT and service delivery continues to get more complex, not only from an inherent technology perspective but also from an operational point of view. So why not learn from the successes of others?"</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>So who was involved?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">There were nine great customers from a mix of industries and countries:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel 1</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li>Datalink - Jack Sparks </li><li>Flextronics - Fernando Gordoa</li><li>UC Davis - Ken Jones </li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel 2</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul><li>Actelion - Sabine Berger </li><li>CERN - Reinoud Martens </li><li>Carlsberg - Meike Dirksen </li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel 3</span></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><ul><li>CareworksTech - Joel Maxwell </li><li>Linium - Steven Horvath </li><li>Teradata - Peter March </li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>So what was said?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">As there were nine mini presentations we covered a lot of ground quickly before getting to the Q&amp;A element of the panels. Thus I have cherry picked some content, ten top tips, from their slide decks:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Give yourself time to plan thoroughly — you don't have as much time to fix things as you think. And your environment is more complex than you think.</li><li>Assess what you need versus what you want — properly assessing your needs will lead to a better mapping of your current state for planning. Properly assessing what you want will lead to aligning proper resources for transforming your business with the change.</li><li>ITSM (IT service management) is RELEVANT beyond IT and it WORKS. Plan for the potential of enterprise service management early even if you are initially only tackling ITSM.</li><li>We had no processes in place so attempted to overlay current thinking on the tool, causing lots of unnecessary changes. We learnt that if vanilla ServiceNow is good enough for tens of thousands, partake of that wisdom. Thus we backed out almost all programmatic changes made during the implementation (an expensive lesson).</li><li>ServiceNow is powerful, be smart on how to use that power…!</li><li>Internal ServiceNow competence is a prerequisite. Start with simple solutions (out of the box as far as possible).</li><li>Import only what is necessary. Keep old/un-needed data out when possible.</li><li>Understand reporting needs early — Operational versus Analytical.</li><li>Plan for and possible create a foundation for Phase 2 — for Teradata this was automation, PPM, SLA and reporting. </li><li>When onboarding colleagues (to a new tool) globally you must explain the benefits. And find owners (for processes) and explain their roles and responsibilities. </li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em>These are taken from the customer slides with just slight editing to add context where needed.</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The need for key stakeholder buy-in was an expected constant throughout all three panel sessions, you know this so I left it out the list of tips. And the following is a nice implementation overview slide from Steve's Linium deck:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3102-9688/K14 MSP Implementation Panel v3.jpg"><img  alt="K14 MSP Implementation Panel v3.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="720" src="12c3373ddbdc93041dcaf3231f961907.iix" style="height: 349px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="1280"/></a> </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em><strong style="color: #ff0000;">But what did I miss from the Top 10 list?</strong></em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> <strong>What was asked was interesting too</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">One of the most interesting things for me was the difference between the questions the audiences asked in the first and second panel Q&amp;A sessions.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In the first panel the questions in the main were people related, such as:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>How did you gain management buy-in?</li><li>What sort of training was needed?</li><li>Did you use external professional services resource?</li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">But in the second there was a different focus — how much money was saved and how was the transformation financially justified? It really was a stark contrast given that the first two panels were back-to-back sessions. In fact I don't even think financials were mentioned in the first session. And I'm still not sure why there was such a difference. Whether the opening question sets the tone for Q&amp;A sessions, with the initial question seeding the thinking of those that ask the subsequent questions. Or whether the fact that the second panel offered European successes had an effect, or maybe that the panel had opened the audience up to the possibility of enterprise service management. I guess I'll never know for sure.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Finally, if you attended Knowledge14 and missed these panels then the customer decks are available to download:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2026" data-containertype="14" data-objectid="1338" data-objecttype="102" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=46bcea25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619de">Panel 1</a></li><li><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2026" data-containertype="14" data-objectid="1340" data-objecttype="102" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=556daa29dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619d2">Panel 2</a></li><li><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2026" data-containertype="14" data-objectid="1398" data-objecttype="102" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=eb0d6ea5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961921">Panel 3</a></li></ul><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em>Please note that these are only available to Knowledge14 registrants.</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em> </em>  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em>If you didn't attend Knowledge14 then maybe we will see you next year.</em></strong></p>
