<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', verdana; font-size: 15px;">I was recently asked to provide a newsletter for several internal teams within our company. The first few months were a pain as I had to use an HTML editor to generate a decent looking newsletter each time I wanted to get the word out on some articles that I have been creating. Finally, I asked myself why I was going through all this pain when ServiceNow would be the perfect platform to build a newsletter application that automates most of the tasks.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', verdana; font-size: 15px;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', verdana; font-size: 15px;"><img   alt="201402-February_html.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="9bc4ec0adb1457049c9ffb651f9619ef.iix" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></span></p><p style="padding-bottom: 18px; color: #000000; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', verdana; font-size: 15px;">Within a couple of days I had a pretty decent application that would allow me to create newsletters with templates, dynamic variables, scripting capability, and article management. Since then, the writing of my newsletters have become much easier to do. Organizing my articles and sending them out to distribution lists are so much better than my copy and paste solution with my previous method.</p><p style="padding-bottom: 18px; color: #000000; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', verdana; font-size: 15px;">I've decided to share this application with others who would like to take it and implement it within their own instance. It is not perfect, and there are several and him that I would like to perform in the future. However, if you're not afraid to play with it, I think you will find it to be a great help to you in creating your own newsletters.</p><p style="padding-bottom: 18px; color: #000000; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', verdana; font-size: 15px;">For full documentation on the app as well as a demo video and downloadable update set, please visit: Â  <a title="w.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/newsletter-application-for-servicenow.html" href="http://www.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/newsletter-application-for-servicenow.html">Create and Send Newsletters using ServiceNow</a></p>
