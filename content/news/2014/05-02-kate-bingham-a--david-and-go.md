<h2><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Plat4mation wins the coveted ServiceNow Innovation of the Year Award!</strong></span></h2><p></p><p class="p1" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img   alt="IOTY Winners.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" src="3ebf5b35dbdc53049c9ffb651f961959.iix" style="height: 412px; width: 620px;"/></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">A live vote open to the more than 6,600 attendees of Knowledge14 this week confirmed the win for Netherlands based Plat4mation for their "Facility4U" application that helps to streamline facility management processes. </span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The impressive Facility4U application includes a meeting room reservation module with visualization capabilities.   Complete with a physical touch screen device mounted outside of each meeting room, users can access instant booking based on availability - regardless of time zone, browser or building location. Users can see Gantt chart-like overviews of room availability and 3D building views, and can even order lunch or equipment right from the app.   In addition, they added Microsoft Exchange integration — so employees can book meeting rooms using Outlook, a ServiceNow portal or the BookNow reservation system within the app.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p class="p1" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Following the announcement of their big win, Elmer de Valk, a managing consultant at the small startup (9 employees), sat down for an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU69SFaKQFI&amp;list=PLenh213llmca9kp4V3wSYyGBAieogs6zW&amp;index=29" style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">interview on SiliconAngle's theCUBE</span></a><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"> where he described their big win as a "David and Goliath" type match-up - going up against a big pool of name-brand </span><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">companies.</span></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">During the interview, de Valk explained Plat4mation's business model typically centers around building applications that are specific to their individual customer's demands. "But if we recognize a need, we don't wait for customers. We build it out," he said.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p class="p1" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Plat4mation really saw their partnering with ServiceNow as an easy decision. And de Valk cited two specific reasons for their decision. "First, we have a decade of experience consulting around ServiceNow and we know it very well," he stated. "And second, we fell in love with ServiceNow. That may sound corny but that's what it is," he said. "It's such a powerful platform."</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p class="p1" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Plat4mation expects to offer their award-winning application both as a pre-packaged product and as a single offering through their ServiceNow partner page and on <span class="s1"><a title="hare.servicenow.com/" href="https://share.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow Share</a></span> — ServiceNow's new content sharing exchange for ServiceNow customer and partners.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Congratulations Guys! And we love the suits!</strong></span></p>
