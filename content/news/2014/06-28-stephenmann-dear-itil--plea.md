<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Ah <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL#Service_asset_and_configuration_management" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">configuration management</a>, the foundation of great IT service management (ITSM).</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Or at least that was what we were being told circa 2008-9 by eager ITSM tool vendors, with pricey CMDB software to sell, on the back of <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.itil-officialsite.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ITIL v3</a>. Being a little OCD I admit that I bought into the need somewhat. Why wouldn't you want everything accounted for and lined up in straight lines?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">But, in my opinion, this was the crux of the issue — it was all about documenting configuration items (CIs) and hopefully their relationships to each other. It was all "very IT," in the same way that a service desk might be revered based on the high volume of incidents it handles. The usual IT behavior that leads to our attention being focused at the wrong points of a value chain and thus on the wrong things.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3208-11210/lego.jpg"><img  alt="lego.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="500" src="4498edc6db505b04ed6af3231f961934.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="600"/></a></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>The CMDB and the politician effect</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">We can talk to the low adoption of configuration management and the configuration management database (CMDB). And the fact that we then on moved to the configuration management system (CMS). It might have been because the practicality of a single "managed data repository" wasn't working (am I the only one to momentarily think of <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH7KYmGnj40" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Star Trek</a> every time "federated CMDB" is mentioned) or it might have been akin to what politicians do — something isn't liked so it's renamed for the proverbial "second bite at the cherry" rather than being buried-to-be-forever-forgotten.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">As far back as 2011, <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.forrester.com/Glenn-O%27Donnell" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Glenn O'Donnell</a> — revered Forrester analyst, co-author of <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-CMDB-Imperative-Realize-Nightmares/dp/0137008376" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The CMDB Imperative</a>, radio ham, and all-round-nice-guy — wrote a research paper called "<a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.forrester.com/Reinvent+The+Obsolete+But+Necessary+CMDB/fulltext/-/E-RES60091" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reinvent The Obsolete But Necessary CMDB</a>" (pay-walled content) in which he proposed that the CMDB be renamed to "Service Information System" on the back of needing to drop the DB and the C from the CMDB for reasons he also succinctly outlines in a public <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/glenn_odonnell/13-12-22-death_to_cmdb_long_live_the_dream" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I no longer have access to Glenn's report — so I'm going by memory — but I feel that there is another card to play here. That is to reconsider the ITIL process we call "configuration management" and, rather than just looking at its worth, consider it from a real-world perspective.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Who can afford to do configuration management?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">… And who can afford not to do configuration management?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">But in many ways this is a red herring. People might find configuration management hard to justify and therefore hard to resource in cash-strapped IT organizations. They might even find it hard to do. But if all they are doing is configuration management for configuration management's sake then does it really matter?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In many ways it's like IT asset management activity that is mostly focused on improving the accuracy of the asset database rather than leveraging what might be less-accurate data to save costs or improve business operations. But, for me, there is an even stronger similarity to knowledge management. And I'm not just talking about ITIL-espoused, ITSM knowledge management. I'm talking about knowledge management per se.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>IMO, knowledge management should be redefined as knowledge exploitation</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The path to enterprise knowledge management has always been littered with obstacles. From knowing what (relevant) knowledge is, getting the people with knowledge to share it (after all knowledge has been power for a very long time), making knowledge accessible when it'sneeded, to ensuring that knowledge is accurate and timely, and thus still relevant.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Yes there are best practices, enabling technologies, and a variety of knowledge management consultants, experts, gurus, self-proclaimed thought leaders, and "highly-effective world-changers" (yes I have seen some dodgy bios this morning). But how many times do we continue to see knowledge management, like configuration or asset management, focus on the collection and codification of knowledge rather than the exploitation of knowledge to enable better outcomes?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">And, even then, how well is that collection done? How often is knowledge management something that is done in addition to the day-job, something that gets left until there is time? Which in the modern work environment will probably never appear.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">So from a configuration management POV, how often is a CMDB the place where IT data goes to die?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Like knowledge management, surely configuration management should be part of operational processes?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">It's not a new concept — that for knowledge management to have any chance of really working it needs to be embedded within business processes rather than being a discrete and disconnected activity that in reality never gets done. For me the same is true for configuration management.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">By all means we can still talk of configuration management. It could even be a sub-process of the ITIL-espoused processes that people do actively use. And, yes, we could still have someone responsible for configuration management. But having configuration management as a separate process? I think we have proven that it doesn't really work outside of large organizations that have the funds to apply significant resource to it.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Instead I'd like to see it play a bigger part in the processes that do get resourced and adopted. Whether it be incident, event, problem, change and release, asset, capacity, or service catalog management (or even procurement and financial management), why can't what was previously separated out as configuration management be subsumed, in a consistent way, into the things that actually get done by IT Operations?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Yes someone else might need to be responsible for things such as discovery and data-accuracy related tasks, but wouldn't it make more sense to make configuration management a "pulled" rather than "pushed" activity?</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong>Is this a pipedream?</strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I don't think so. In some ways this is already happening despite configuration management being a discrete and somewhat unloved ITIL process. For example, a year ago I wrote of <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="1338" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=d46caaa1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619ab">the high CMDB use within ServiceNow customers</a> even though I doubted that many really did formal configuration management:</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em>"The real ITSM standout is the 82% CMDB usage. Now this doesn't necessarily mean that four out of every five ServiceNow customers are "doing" configuration management — what it does mean is that they are leveraging the CMDB and the information it holds to support other ITSM processes such as incident, change, asset, and capacity management."</em></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><em>So what about it for the next version of ITIL? Should we continue to have a discrete configuration management process that organizations either never get round to or struggle to adopt? Or should we look at how the benefits of configuration management can be achieved through the adaption of the processes that organizations do adopt?</em></strong></p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><em>Image source: <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/riddle_/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/riddle_/</a> </em></p>
