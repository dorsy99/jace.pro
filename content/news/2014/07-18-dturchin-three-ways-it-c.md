PAC is twenty customers hand-picked to guide our product strategy.</p><p class="p1" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p class="p1">I shared our roadmap and asked them two questions in exchange: what is ServiceNow to you and where would you like us to be investing our dev dollars? I met each customer separately and yet the replies were amazingly consistent.</p><p class="p1" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p class="p1">Here's what I heard:</p><p class="p2" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><ol class="ol1"><li><strong>Every company will soon be a software company</strong>. Every customer is increasingly dependent on technology to run their core business. For example, IT at <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.enterpriseholdings.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Enterprise Holdings</a>, the rental car company, supports self-service kiosks that eliminate the need for humans and paper in branches. As a customer, that's why I'm loyal to National! It's an incredible customer experience. <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.harley-davidson.com/content/h-d/en_US/home.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harley-Davidson</a> (...thanks for the joy ride!) supports the systems that process orders from distributors and suppliers. IT is no longer a technology traffic cop. It's the owner of technology experiences that create competitive advantage.</li><li><strong>Business speaks the language of service</strong>. Business leaders can't relate to the old language of IT. Ping times, CPU utilization, and paging file sizes are worse than meaningless to end-users. They erect artificial barriers that perpetuate cultural stereotypes about IT and prevent the CIO from having a seat at the strategy table. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.allstate.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Allstate Insurance</a> says their biggest challenge is making sense out of what's in their CMDB. What they need is a way to communicate health of services to line of business executives. Communicating health of infrastructure at the level of CI metrics is counterproductive. As an aside, every customer I met shared a version of that feedback and cheered our acquisition of Neebula's (fantastic!) ServiceWatch product which builds and maintains service topology maps via top-down discovery.</span></li><li><strong>More apps, more changes, and more data make managing infrastructure more challenging.</strong> Infrastructure is changing more rapidly than ever. Distinguishing signal from noise is increasingly important and, unfortunately, legacy monitoring tools are increasingly ill-prepared to operate at cloud scale. At <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www2.wwt.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World Wide Technology</a>, IT operations monitors infrastructure in the company's Advanced Technology Center (ATC) which is used to showcase the company's product innovations to external customers. At <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.discover.com/company/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discover Financial</a>, Netcool OMNIbus is keeling under its own weight and they need a migration strategy. Every customer shared some tale of woe that involved needing a scalable strategy for managing operations and massive quantities of information. They provided invaluable feedback on the <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/event-management.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Event Management application</a> we released in Eureka and why managing events on their ITSM platform is essential.</li></ol><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p class="p1">It's incredibly intimidating to be reminded of the challenges our customers face daily… and incredibly motivating to know we're on the right track.</p><p class="p2" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p class="p1">PAC midwest customers: thanks for 72 hours of high-energy geek nirvana. I have plenty to digest but promise to return soon… with new features in tow and the same requests I had this week: keep pushing us, keep educating us, keep inspiring us.</p><p class="p2" style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p class="p1">P.S. Jim, hope you get a commission on my new hog!</p>
