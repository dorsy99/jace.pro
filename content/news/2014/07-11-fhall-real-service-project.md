<p><span style="color: black;">Strolling through the community, one sees great material on technical issues. Given the rich set of enterprise offerings available in Eureka release, though, it seemed like some community comment on actual project/product management of ServiceNow could be worthwhile. How to start? <em>Where</em> to start?</span></p><p><span style="color: black;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: black;">As a current project manager with reasonable experience in Helpdesk turnarounds and management, Operations bootstrapping and management, and much process mapping and implementation, I respectfully share some fairly densely-packed observations from experience. I hope they're of use. Feedback is most welcome. <br/></span></p><p><span style="color: black;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: black;">---<br/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: black;"><strong>Project Management is Public Relations Management.</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: black;">There's no such thing as an IT project. They're <em>all</em> business projects. Some are stewarded by IT.

Add them to the project team. </span></li><li><span style="color: black;">Know who your people are. Know what they do. Document what they do. Make sure <em>they</em> know what they do. Use a RACI Matrix. Publish it.</span></li><li><span style="color: black;">Know how you're going to talk to them. Make sure <em>they</em> know how you're going to talk to them.

This is <em>especially</em> true in service organizations! <br/> (Recommended reading: Eliyahu Goldratt's "The Goal")</span></li><li><span style="color: black;">If you can't draw it, you don't understand it. </span><ul><li><span style="color: black;">Can you whiteboard the process(es) in question so everyone using it nods their head 'yes'?</span></li><li><span style="color: black;">Can you whiteboard required process improvements so everyone invested therein nods their head 'yes'?</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: black;">If you don't draw it, you won't understand it. </span><ul><li><span style="color: black;">Visio is your friend. </span></li><li><span style="color: black;">Have you iterated the workflows until all your stakeholders agree with them?

Don't let management or line-staff stuff "shiny bits" into the cart. </span></li><li><span style="color: black;">IT loses credibility through over-scoping. Fix real, <em>defined</em> business problems. Bound your scope. <span style="color: black;">Don't over-reach. </span>Triage ruthlessly. </span></li><li><span style="color: black;">Demonstrate success by fixing those real, defined business problems. Then fix the next business problem. Repeat. </span></li><li><span style="color: black;">Ensure all your people understand and <em>communicate</em> the value you've added. Build inter-team credibility. Share the victories. </span></li></ul>
