<p>I put together a quick slide to give everybody a rough idea of how content moves from creation to publish within ServiceNow. To help highlight some of the other decision points we have related to content, I included our multimedia (videos) and social media decision points as well.</p><p></p><p>Most of the workflow you see below is automated. The parts that aren't automated relate to the multimedia and social media areas, though there's no reason we couldn't automate the prompting of those decision points as well.</p><p></p><p>In the workflow we have, there are eight main categories. At the Tech Review stage, we have two people from Support and two people from Development identified as reviewers for each category. They're tenured staff that simply review suggested content to ensure it is valid and technically accurate. When content is suggested, it triggers a notification for one of them to review content. Only one of the reviewers needs to approve the content.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Slide1.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="0e8d450adb189f048c8ef4621f961930.iix" style="height: 349px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>In case people are interested, here's the <a title="ww.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo">YouTube channel</a> where you can find our videos. For the social aspect, we talk about the latest, most impactful, or interesting content on the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/support/blog">Support Blog</a> and talk about it on <a title="witter.com/nowsupport" href="https://twitter.com/nowsupport">Twitter</a> as well.</p><p></p><p>If you have any questions about our workflow or our implementation, just ask.</p><p></p><p>What does the workflow look like at your organization? What are the pros/cons of your implementation? I'm always up for learning what other people in the industry are doing... especially if it's working well.</p>
