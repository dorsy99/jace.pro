<p>When it comes to creating content, we go through a process that many of you likely go through as well:</p><ul><li>Support identifies a gap in knowledge and creates content to fill the gap</li><li>Known errors are created based on a Problem (PRB)</li><li>Ad hoc KB creation that doesn't have a distinct driver, but a need is identified</li></ul><p>There's one other thing we're doing that, maybe some of you do as well... But for those not doing it, maybe it'll give you something new to try in your organization. We are pulling all incident short descriptions within a specified time frame (my team is using trailing 3 months) and separating those by category.</p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Within each category, we are identifying the main incident drivers, including the symptoms and causes. To do that, we read short description and add it to a "bucket." For example, in our Import/Export category we would have one bucket for transform maps and another for imports taking a long time to complete. After grouping the short descriptions and getting an idea of the main symptoms, we meet with Development and Support and determine the major causes of each bucket type. We then work with the teams to write content based on those causes.</span></p><p></p><p>Adopting this methodology has resulted in a really healthy bump to our monthly views and is increasing customer search success in our instance of Knowledge as well as through the Self Service area.</p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2014-05-14 at 1.37.01 PM.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="cfbe67bddb94df04e9737a9e0f961979.iix" style="height: 395px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>What are you doing to identify and create your most impactful content?</p>
