<h3>Why monitor from ServiceNow?</h3><p></p><p>A handful of vendors have built SQL Server and Exchange performance products that can be deployed to collect performance metrics. So Why do the Monitor from your ServiceNow Instance? The short answer is "why not"?   Monitoring from ServiceNow will allow you to integrate processes like change, CMDB, incident with your SQL and Exchange monitoring. Since MSSQL and Exchange supports critical business services, why not take advantage of all the benefits of running the monitoring side to side with your discovery, incident, event management and other applications? </p><p></p><p>With the latest release of Evanios Monitoring, You can now monitor your MS-SQL databases and MS-Exchange directly from ServiceNow. An out of the box Module was created to help you monitor your databases and Exchange instances in no time. The monitoring provisioning, thresholds settings, metric graphs, incident creation … all happens directly from your ServiceNow instance.   The Evanios Agents that gets installed on premise will collect MS-SQL and MS-Exchange availability, performance and capacity metrics and forward the data to ServiceNow for analysis. Database Status, deadlocks, cache hit ratio, space utilization, critical services and counters will be collected immediately. </p><p></p><p>Some of the benefits are: </p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Automatic provisioning:</strong> Once a SQL database is discovered, it can be provisioned automatically based on the business service it's supporting. </li><li></li><li><strong>Automatically adjust the provisioning:</strong> When a SQL database or Exchange instance move from staging to production, the monitoring setting will be adjusted automatically.</li><li></li><li><strong>Unified Dashboard:</strong> See metrics data for your instance, critical tickets and other related information on the same dashboard.</li><li></li><li><strong>Time Sensitive Operations:</strong>   Configure separate set of alerting thresholds for your MSSQL and Exchange metrics during a scheduled change window. </li></ul><p> <br/> <strong>BSM Maps:</strong> Shows the MS-SQL database in major state. </p><p></p><p><img  alt="mssql-bsm.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="c2518942db50130468c1fb651f9619d9.iix" style="height: 268px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Event details</strong> that generated this failure:</p><p></p><p><img  alt="mssql-event.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7eaf1082dbd85344e9737a9e0f961938.iix" style="height: 297px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Historical graph </strong>of the metric:</p><p></p><p><img  alt="mssql-graph.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" src="4460088edbd01344e9737a9e0f961937.iix" style="height: 258px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p>There are many other reasons as to why you would want to collocate your monitoring with your ITSM and other modules on the same platform. You can try it for yourself and let me know your findings.</p>
