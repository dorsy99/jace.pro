Waiting for urgent pages. Waiting for the phone to ring.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Infrastructure has monitored us. We've been scheduled and manipulated and frustrated by our own franken-systems that generate billions of signals yet force us to react to noise. While we've been focused on optimizing human-based IT processes we've let machines run amok.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">In a world where people talk to people and machines, and machines talk to machines, we're finally able to create new taxonomies and processes that deliver on the unfulfilled promise of operations management: automated service remediation.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">We're hard at work making it as easy and reliable to let either machines or people initiate IT processes and tasks. We're on the cusp of a breakthrough that will finally operationalize the closed-loop change management sequence we've been teased with for years:</p><p class="p1"></p><ol class="ol1"><ol><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Infrastructure events generate alerts which are</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Correlated with known error patterns and</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Associated with CIs in the CMDB which are</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Associated with business services which are</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Automatically maintained by network discovery in topology maps which</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Define business impact and SLAs which</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Are linked with configuration automation tasks which</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Update service health dashboards and</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Automatically restore infrastructure to a desired state when issues are identified which</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Automatically resolve incidents, problems, and changes as issues are remediated which</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Clear associated infrastructure events and</em></span></li><li><span style="color: #333300;"><em>Create knowledge to improve subsequent remediation behavior.</em></span></li></ol></ol><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">That's what we're working on in the lab. That's why we've been building out our portfolio of orchestration applications that started with a sophisticated workflow editor which led to deep integrations into Active Directory and PowerShell and has since extended into cloud provisioning, configuration automaton, and event management.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">It may sound overly ambitious (we hope it does). It may sound like what others have promised for years (that's why we're hungrier than ever). It may sound hollow or opaque (it won't in a few days).</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Students of history should recall that the same criticism was used in 2004 by skeptics casting doubt on the ambitions of a company disrupting another stodgy market suffocated by legacy software. The company was ServiceNow and the market was IT Service Management. We now process 3.4 billion transactions in the cloud monthly and those naysayers are nowhere to be found.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Join us and 6,000 of the most talented technology visionaries on the planet this week in San Francisco at <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/">Knowledge14</a> and <a title="nowledge.servicenow.com/speakers.html" href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/speakers.html">learn more about other outlandish goals</a> we set in years past and how we've over-delivered on our promises.
