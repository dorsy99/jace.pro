There is information out there about how unplanned business service downtime is due to change (and therefore a failure in IT change control). Other articles point to unplanned downtime resulting from human error.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">     </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Yet, in today's landscape, there can be other impactful issues, such as security vulnerabilities, especially where personal information or sensitive data is at stake. </span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">This fact becomes especially important in organizations and amongst teams that operate in an agile development environment, where fast and regular iterations of the core product — which is that which serves to distinguish the company in the marketplace and is imperative along the pathway to market leadership — are being released to introduce new features or otherwise improve performance.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">In this type of environment, where the development team is generally rolling out new builds on a monthly basis (and perhaps even more regularly), problems often arise in the gap that exists between the development and operations teams. Fast and short iterations of the core service require rapid and sometimes automated deployment procedures from IT teams, who are being pressed to ensure that the production environment is stable, functional and performing optimally. And as development continues to push new builds towards production, IT is often introducing new components into the infrastructure to support various aspects of the core product.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">About a year ago, the ServiceWatch team was in conversations with a company who initially elected not to move forward. They claimed that our proof-of-concept failed because — while building a service map — ServiceWatch discovered that there were development servers tied into the production environment. While we were confident in our product and its findings, we regrettably watched them walk away only to have them return a few weeks later after their own internal investigation found out that we were correct; there were development servers active in the production environment, which introduced a significant security vulnerability that the company (and now customer!) was able to quickly remedy.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">DevOps is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals that aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services. It is a method that effectively combines and accounts for: product development, technology operations, and quality assurance. In short, DevOps is a method that seeks to bridge the gap between development and operations teams in a way that allows for greater efficiency for the operation, and a better experience for the end-user of the core service. In order to promote DevOps harmony, it is important that the operations team responsible for managing the production environment begins to manage from the perspective of the business service(s) being powered by the IT infrastructure as opposed to managing the components of the IT infrastructure without a sense of context for the service(s) that it underlies.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">With the advent of virtualization, organizations that rely on agile development to stay ahead of the competition run the risk of a fragmented and disorganized infrastructure with VMs spread out all over the place. It can be difficult to keep track of the physical locations of each VM, many of which are powering mission-critical pieces of the core product. In this sort of environment, having an up-to-date, service-centric map that makes sense out of the increasingly complex IT infrastructure powering many of today's most powerful applications is critical.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">In a landscape where a single business service may have dozens of distinct virtualized IT components, it is critical that the traditional approach taken by IT organizations of managing disparate technology silos shifts towards managing the business services that are running in the data center. Otherwise IT is not supporting the business in an optimal manner</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">   </span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Next…One Body, Many Parts: Bridging Your Organization's Business Service Gap</span></p>
