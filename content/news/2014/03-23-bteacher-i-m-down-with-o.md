<p>Attached is my slide desk from last week's SNUG.   The ServiceNow ODBC driver might not sound as new and sexy as something like a PHP integration, but it's exactly what I needed to interface with some legacy apps.   My favorite part about the driver is that it converts SQL queries into web service messages.   At the SNUG someone told me that they're using an ServiceNow ODBC driver to feed their data warehouse.</p><p></p><p><img  class="image-0 jiveImage" src="8d8dc44edb5c1344e9737a9e0f961906.iix" style="max-height: 900px; max-width: 1200px;"/></p>
