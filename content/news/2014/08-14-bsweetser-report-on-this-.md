<p>In our Asset Management course, we cover how to create some basic asset-related reports in ServiceNow. The upcoming Eureka update to the course even includes the more advanced topic of <a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2927" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="3278" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=aface625dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961963">Database Views</a> to get the data you need. I often lead into the discussion with the question, "What reports do you use today for asset management?" This is usually met with responses like "a<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> list of assets in use" or "a</span> list of assets by model."</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>The course includes a basic report on computers by warranty expiration so you can see what assets have upcoming warranty expirations. It also moves beyond the list and includes a pivot report to show expenditure with a vendor based on model category, which could certainly be useful as you plan new purchases.</p><p><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-3334-12551/Vendor Spend pivot report.png"><img  alt="Vendor Spend pivot report.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="495" src="343da446db549304b322f4621f96192c.iix" style="height: 237px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="1297"/></a></p><p>But I still felt that something was missing. There had to be some common reports that any Asset Manager or Software Asset Manager would want to access!</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>I wasn't alone. Some of our Technical Consultants had already started to build a list of these common reports. Rather than reinventing the wheel on every engagement, I took the list and created an Update Set that includes all these reports and their supporting resources (including some Database Views) for all of us to reuse. We couldn't keep it to ourselves though, so this Update Set is now available on <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/bddb05892b62a1004a1e976be8da156b/overview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Share</a>. If you work in Asset Management, be sure to check it out and let me know what you think.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>And so I ask you: <strong>What reports do you use today for asset management? Are they included in the Update Set?</strong> If not, let me know and we can get them included.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">  </p><p>I would like to thank the TCs who worked with me on this, namely <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-link-profile-small" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="16734" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=debeca6ddbd41fc09c9ffb651f961975">Paul Doc Burnham</a>, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-link-profile-small" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="12236" data-objecttype="3" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=ca305ea5db581fc09c9ffb651f9619c0">Scott Lemm</a>, and <a title="" _jive_internal="true" class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-link-profile-small" data-containerid="-1" data-containertype="-1" data-objectid="23018" data-objecttype="3" href="tod.mcconahay@servicenow.com">Tod McConahay</a>.</p>
