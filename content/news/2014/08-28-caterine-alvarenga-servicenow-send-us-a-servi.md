<p><span>At the upcoming Eastern Pennsylvania SNUG on Tuesday, September 16th we thought it would be fun to showcase screenshots of Service Catalogs from the different customers in the user group.   We'll compile the different screenshots we receive and play them on a loop during registration, breaks, lunch etc.   This should spark some good discussions during our roundtable sessions and will hopefully be a good way to share best practices.   If you're interested in having us include your Service Catalog, please email a screenshot to Caterine Alvarenga at </span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:Caterine.Alvarenga@servicenow.com">Caterine.Alvarenga@servicenow.com</a><span>.</span></p>
