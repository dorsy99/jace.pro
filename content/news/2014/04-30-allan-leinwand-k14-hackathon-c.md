<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">YES! We are just hours away from the start of the Knowledge14 CreateNow Hackathon. The assignment: Come up with a functioning app that makes best use of the ServiceNow Service Automation Platform. It doesn't have to be IT, it doesn't even have to be business — as long as it stretches our perception of what service automation could entail. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If your looking for Hackathon tips, check this <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/learn/knowledge-user-conference/blog/2014/04/26/lets-get-ready-to-create--want-some-tips">recent blog</a>.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Over 700 creators in over 100 teams registered to compete in this clash of Service Automation minds — and even more are likely to join. During registration, participating teams got to choose between a Dublin and Eureka product release instance. Having been in Eureka labs for a couple of days already here at Knowledge14, getting to play around with it some more proves quite attractive for our contestants. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><br/></span></p><p><img  alt="Hackathon_screenshot.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="271" src="48f00542dbd09f048c8ef4621f961956.iix" style="height: 270.779px; width: 523px;" width="523"/></p><p><strong style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&gt; If you are attending Knowledge14 and you feel like competing, just show up — we'll find you a team!</strong></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Scouts will help the judging team to draw up a long-list of candidates for the finals. The judges will then select the winners, who will receive a Golden Ticket to enter the finals. Their first prize: they get to continue developing all through the night!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wednesday morning, the finalist teams will promote their apps on the ExpoNow floor to get the public to text in votes to select their favorites.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Finally, public and jury votes combined will decide on the winning team, whom I will be announcing as part of Dan McGee's keynote on Thursday morning. That's where they will collect eternal glory, bragging rights and cool prizes. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Keep an eye on the <a title="mmunity.servicenow.com/" href="http://community.servicenow.com/">BuzzHub</a> for a continuous update on the end-to-end Hackathon happening. </span></p>
