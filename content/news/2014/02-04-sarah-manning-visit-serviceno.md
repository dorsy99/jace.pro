However, establishing new Service and Process Governance and roles is a critical success factor for your ITSM improvement initiatives. Within ITIL there are many roles that help to focus others on, and manage key process for the delivery of effective and efficient IT services. These roles include Process Owners, Business Relationship Managers, an emerging concept of a Service Management Office and various process specific roles, etc. In this revealing panel discussion, ITIL practitioners and industry consultants will discuss the importance of these roles and why you should consider them, and best practices for assigning responsibilities and accountabilities.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">         4.
