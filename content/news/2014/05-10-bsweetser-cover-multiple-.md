<p>Contract management and asset management are closely related to one another. For example, if you track a lease contract, you want to associate all the assets covered by that lease to the contract. Because the Asset Covered information requires a date, you cannot simply select assets to cover with a list collector. In an effort to help you add multiple assets to a contract at once, here is a quick video that details how to use an import set to tie multiple assets to a contract at once.</p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/bjYvMoP_ERQ" width="425" height="350"/></p><p></p><p>To perform this import, the most important thing is to know what table to import to.</p><p></p><p>To add assets covered by a contract: <strong>Asset Covered [clm_m2m_contract_asset]</strong></p><p>To add users covered by a contract: <strong>Users Covered [clm_m2m_contract_user]</strong></p><p>To add assets covered by a rate card: <strong>Asset Covered [clm_m2m_rate_card_asset]</strong></p><p>To add users covered by a rate card: <strong>Rate Card Users [clm_m2m_rate_card_user]</strong></p><p></p><p>The contract and assets should exists prior to running this import.</p><p>To cover users and assets by a rate card, you need to first cover them by the contract and create the rate card.</p><p></p><p>If you use this information to quickly add assets and users to your contracts, please let me know in the comments below.</p>
