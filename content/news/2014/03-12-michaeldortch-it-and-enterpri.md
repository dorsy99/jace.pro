<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Whatever your role or position, your ability to tell a good story, whether written or delivered as a presentation, is increasingly critical to your success. Herewith, a few pointers you should find useful when presenting, in the same room with your audience or online.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;">If you've ever watched "The Simpsons," you may have noticed this statue from the sequence of images that introduces almost every episode.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="Jebediah Springfields Statue.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="442" src="41901102db94d344e9737a9e0f961962.iix" style="height: 442px; float: left; width: 236.78571428571428px;" width="237"/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For those of you who aren't "Simpsons" fans, this is a statue of Jebediah Springfield, founder of the town that bears his name, where the Simpsons live. But the reason the statue's relevant here is the quote at the base. It says "A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man." Leaving aside that "embiggens" is a made-up word, I think the plaque makes an important point about good storytelling. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>A good story empowers even the most reluctant storyteller.</strong></em> </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What this means to you as a storyteller or presenter is that if you've got a good story to tell, you needn't fear or worry about telling it. And if you're talking about what ServiceNow solutions can do or are doing for your enterprise, you've likely got a good story to tell. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Of course, no story, no matter how compelling, can actually tell itself. So it couldn't hurt to have a bit of help with the "telling" part of storytelling. Here's some, based on the recommendations we make to presenters at our Knowledge events. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Once you know you have a good story to tell, everything else is really all about your audience. And there are four things both your story and its telling should do with and for that audience. </span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Engage</strong> — open with statements that establish a <em>bond</em> with your audience. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Inform</strong> — tell them something that gets them to <em>lean forward</em>. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Persuade</strong> — convince them that your story is <em>credible</em>, <em>compelling</em>, and <em>relevant to them</em>. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Invite</strong> — call them to <em>action</em> via your Top Take-Aways! </span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Speaking of that story, please remember that it's not about your slides. Slides do <em>not</em> tell the story. That's <em>your</em> job. Slides merely illustrate and amplify the key points you're trying to make. In that context, there are "three R's" of great presenting. </span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Rehearse</strong> — even just one run-through will improve your content and timing.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Relate</strong> — more conversation, less lecturing.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Relax</strong> — everyone is there by choice and wants you to succeed, so they can understand and use the information you're sharing.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are also another "three R's" you must avoid to be a good storyteller. </span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Reading</strong> your slides. Your audience can do that without you. (You hate sitting through such presentations, don't you?)</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Rushing</strong> through your content. Cut your presentation down a bit instead. (Save the cut bits for your triumphant return.)</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>"Retailing."</strong> Resist all temptation to promote or cheerlead for your company (or yourself). Let the greatness of your story do your "selling" for you!</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And here are four final tips, three focused on wrapping up your presentation, and the fourth applicable throughout.</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <strong>End with your Top Take-Aways</strong>, including relevant contact coordinates, such as Web site or e-mail addresses. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Leave at least 10 minutes for Q&amp;A</strong>. If your total allotted time is 60 minutes, make sure you can give your presentation completely and comfortably in no more than 50 minutes (and preferably 40 to 45 for extra wiggle room). </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Repeat every question before answering it</strong>. It not only helps the audience hear the question, but also gives you a chance to ensure that the question you heard is what the questioner meant. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Breathe.</strong> It's the pause that refreshes, after all.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You can always find great written examples of ServiceNow customer stories told well in the "<a title="k-custom" class="jive-link-custom" href="http://www.servicenow.com/customers/customer-successes.html/" target="_blank">Customer Successes</a>" section of the ServiceNow Web site.
