<p>I recently joined Boston University to implement Service-Now. I had come from a large and fast growing retail environment where over almost 3 years I implemented Service-Now. Every day I am amazed at the differences in the industries and this of course reflects on the differences necessary for a Service-Now implementation within the higher education industry.<br />I am creating this group for others to collaborate and share ideas around some of the uniqueness of this environment:<br />•Dealing with multiple campuses and/or multiple schools within a campus.<br />•Defining SLA's and a priority matrix for the higher education principles and strategies.<br />•Dealing with student employees.<br />•503 compliance.<br />•FERPA compliance.<br />•Dealing with user data; student data retention and users not in the directory.<br />•Service Catalog.<br />•Change Management scope and goverenance.<br />•Usability excellence for students, faculty and staff.<br />I am excited to introduce this group for focused collaboration for the higher education industry.<br /><br />Join the Higher Education SIG on the Groups page.<br /><br />http://community.service-now.com/og<br /><br />Join the Higher Education discussion on our forums page.<br /><br />http://community.service-now.com/forums<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Matt Gaide<br />Service Management Application Administrator<br />Information Services &amp; Technology<br />Boston University<br />gaidem@bu.edu<br />http://www.bu.edu/tech</p>
