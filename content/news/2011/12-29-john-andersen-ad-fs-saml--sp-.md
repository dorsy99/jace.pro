<p>Several months ago, I worked with a client to develop some steps that AD FS users could take to get SAML 2.0 authentication to work between AD FS 2.0 and ServiceNow. There were two big caveats in those instructions:<br />1) SP-Initiated Authentication did not work<br />2) SingleLogout did not work<br /><br />As long as a customer was going to an Identity Provider first and logging in, we would handle the SAML authentication into ServiceNow. However, this was not a good solution for several customers. Over the Christmas break, I did some research, and worked with a few AD FS gurus at client sites to get these two issues resolved.<br /><br />So, if you are a customer, or you have a client that is trying to implement ADFS 2.0 with ServiceNow through SAML 2.0, I would recommend the following reading:<br /><br />1) http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Configuring_ADFS_2.0_to_Communicate_with_SAML_2.0<br />2) http://www.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/fixing-sp-initiated-login-with-adfs-2-0-and-servicenow-saml.html<br />3) http://www.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/possible-fix-for-adfs-2-0-singlelogout-with-servicenow.html</p>
