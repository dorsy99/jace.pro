<p>Last week <a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1">I wrote about the Change Management conflict checking.</a><br /><br />The example I showed was the Conflict checker ensuring that the Change is scheduled to start and finish within the Maintenance Window.<br /><br />I should have pointed out that this functionality is only available in the demo instance at the moment, and will hopefully be included in the upcoming October 2011 release. Sorry for any confusion there.<br /><br />As a reminder the conflict checker my mark a Change record as conflicted based on a few different reasons:<br /><br /><ul><li>The change window occurs outside of a Maintenance Window. <i>"Not in Maintenance Window"</i></li><li>The change window overlaps with another Change Record against the same component of the Infrastructure (The same Configuration Item) <i>"CI already scheduled"</i></li><li>The change occurs during a defined Blackout Window, where no changes should occur to this CI <i>"Blackout"</i></li><li>A relationship exists with a parent/child CI and the Change occurs when that CI isn't available for Change. <i>"Parent/Child CI already scheduled</i></li></ul><br /><br />In this post we are going to look at the conflict checker detecting issues where a CI has overlapping Change Windows.<br /><br /><h3>CI already scheduled</h3><br /><br />Using the same example Maintenance Window as in the first post, today there are two Request For Change records needing approval.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="1482e14adbdc1b04ed6af3231f961993.iix" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table><tr><th>Change number</th><th>Description</th><th>CIs</th><th>Change Window</th></tr><tr><td>CHG0030001</td><td>Increase memory to 4GB</td><td><ul><li>LON1DC01</li></ul></td><td>2011-09-24 from 10:00 to 12:00</td></tr><tr><td>CHG0030002</td><td>Apply Security Patches to Domain Controllers</td><td><ul><li>LON1DC01</li><li>LON1DC02</li></ul></td><td>2011-09-24 from 11:00 to 15:00</td></tr></table><br /><br />As you can see <b>CHG0030002</b> is going to overlap <b>CHG0030001</b> for an hour because it includes LON1DC01 as an affected CI.<br /><br />The Change Records look like this:<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="70fcfc86db509f048c8ef4621f961940.iix" /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="e58b54c6db585304b322f4621f9619a6.iix" /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="f84cd4cedb9c17041dcaf3231f961974.iix" /><br /><br />So, obviously there would be a problem with approving both of these Change records, as we would have concurrent activity on LON1DC01.<br /><br />Clicking the Check Conflict related link will show us the conflict status....<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="cd5ebff9db141304b322f4621f96198c.iix" /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="7c82a58edb10d7049c9ffb651f96191e.iix" /><br /><br />One important point here is that LON1DC01 wasn't the Primary CI for CHG0030002 - it was added as an Affected CI at the bottom of the form.<br /><br />Change conflict detection has 2 modes - Basic and Advanced. To check the conflict status of related CIs requires that you set the mode to Advanced, which can be done in the <b>Conflict Properties</b>.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="69fc3486db9497041dcaf3231f9619fa.iix" /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="ce8bd882db1c9fc068c1fb651f96198c.iix" /><br /><br />I'll roll up the last 2 conflict conditions into the last blog post.<br /><br />Read also:<br /><ul><li><br /><a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1">Change Management conflict checking - Part 1</a></li><li><a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Change_Management_Collision_Detector" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Change_Management_Collision_Detector">Change Management Conflict Detection on the ServiceNow Wiki.</a></li></ul></p>
