<p>As part of our continuing efforts to deliver world class support, it is my pleasure to announce that effective 5/16/2011 we will be enhancing our service level agreements for response times to incidents. Moving forward we will maintain the following SLA's for response:<br /> <br />Priority 1: 15 min (Previously was 30 min)<br />Priority 2: 30 min (Previously was 2 hours)<br />Priority 3: 1 hour (Previously was 8 hours)<br />Priority 4: 4 hours (Previously was 3 days)<br /> <br />As always we appreciate your feedback. <br /> <br />Jared Laethem<br />Manager, Technical Support U.S.</p>
