<p><img __jive_id="6849" alt="Brown Dog.jpg" class="jive-image" style="width: imagecache/Thumb/SlightlyLoony/Brown Dog.jpg; height: auto;" />If you followed <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2011/1/18/2053" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=09dc6665dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96198f">my last post</a>, then you should now have a normalization configuration for the Computer table's CPU Type field. But as is, it doesn't actually <i>do</i> anything. Let's fix that!<br /><br />But first you need to understand a few concepts (don't worry, they're not hard). Grab a cup of your favorite brain stimulant and read on:<br /><!--break--><br />Field normalization works with three different kinds of <i>values</i>, all of which appear (or could appear) in the normalized field. The three kinds are:<br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="8b6e3331db18d3041dcaf3231f9619d0.iix" style="width: auto; height: 68px;" /></li><li><i>Pending</i>: These are the different values that actually appear in your system in the field being normalized, but which you have not yet decided whether they are <i>Normal</i> values or <i>Alias</i> values (see below). When you first create a configuration, these values are automatically collected (it can take up to a few minutes to do so). <i>All</i> values are <i>Pending</i> values until you decide to do something with them. As your system is being used, once the field normalization configuration is active, any values entered, imported, or discovered that are not equal to either a <i>Normal</i> value or an <i>Alias</i> value are automatically added as a <i>Pending</i> value. You can review this list of <i>Pending</i> values regularly to figure out what they should be, and fix them up if need be. This is the primary way you keep your data normalized as that pesky real world keeps dumping new kinds and variations of values into your normalized field. The picture at right shows what some of the pending values on my system looked like when I first created this configuration.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="ad45a106db9c130468c1fb651f96194b.iix" style="width: auto; height: 75px;" /></li><li><i>Normal</i>: These are the values that you've decided are the ones you <i>want</i> to appear in the normalized field. We're using the term "normal" much as it would be used by a database expert: when there are multiple ways to express a particular value, the <i>Normal</i> form is the <i>one</i> way you want it. For example, the pending values shown above are all different ways of expressing "Xeon" — and I want the <i>Normal</i> value for those to actually <i>be</i> Xeon. You can see in the example at right what <i>Normal</i> values I've decided I want in my instance for the CPU type. These values can be anything you want. In particular, they do <i>not</i> have to be a value that was a <i>Pending</i> value — you can create arbitrary <i>Normal</i> values.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="d9470986dbd0130468c1fb651f961988.iix" style="width: auto; height: 94px;" /></li><li><i>Alias</i>: These are values that are another way of expressing a particular <i>Normal</i> value. For exampe, the pending values shown above all happen to be <i>aliases</i> for "Xeon". Probably the most important thing to remember about <i>Alias</i> values is that they're always associated with a <i>Normal</i> value, as you can see at right, where the four <i>Alias</i> values are associated with the <i>Normal</i> value "Xeon".</li></ul><br /><br />Ok, that's about enough for one day! Next we'll talk about <i>Normalization Rules</i> and how they and aliases work together to actually do the normalization...</p>
