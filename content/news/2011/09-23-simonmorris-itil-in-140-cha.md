<p>One of the barriers to learning about ITIL, is the sheer volume of text.<br /><br />I don't know exactly how many words are contained within the 5 books, but aside from that raw number the text can be dense and heavy going.<br /><br />I thought I'd have a crack at breaking it down into more manageable chunks for my own reference. Having the correct definitions is essential when trying to communicate with colleagues and customers - as with any common dialog or language.<br /><br />Being inherently lazy, I didn't want to have to do all of the work myself - so I set up a platform for others to contribute short snippets of text to build up a database.<br /><br /><a title="il-in-140.appspot.com" href="http://itil-in-140.appspot.com">ITIL in 140</a> is an application running on Google App Engine that will show you small chunks of ITIL knowledge in a whizzy AJAX scrolling box.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="ede091c6db5897049c9ffb651f96195c.iix" /><br /><br />You can also <a title="il-in-140.appspot.com/contribute" href="http://itil-in-140.appspot.com/contribute">contribute</a> some definitions, and if you follow <a title="itter.com/ThatITSMGuy" href="http://twitter.com/ThatITSMGuy">@ThatITSMGuy</a> on Twitter he'll tweet you 4 definitions a day.<br /><br />I've been happily surprised at learning more ITIL definitions since I started updating the database and reading other peoples submissions.<br /><br />Give it a go! <a title="il-in-140.appspot.com" href="http://itil-in-140.appspot.com">ITIL in 140</a></p>
