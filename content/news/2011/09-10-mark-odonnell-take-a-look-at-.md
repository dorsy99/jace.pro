<p>Rather that forgoing the pains of brain surgery so that my thoughts on Content Management System (CMS) can be seen by the ServiceNow community, I took some time this past week to add to the CMS Wiki. Start with this, and let me know if it helps and if you would like to see more sites broken down with code examples.<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Tutorial_-_Building_Our_Website_in_CMS<br />Truth be told, I am not much of a writer, but do see my share of misunderstandings along the topic of CMS. I am following this tutorial up with a similar section on the ESS Portal. Look for this entire section to have new content in the near future.<br /><br />- OD</p>
