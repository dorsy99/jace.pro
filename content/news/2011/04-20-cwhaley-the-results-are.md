<p>We didn't get as many poll responses as I expected, but it looks like Quarterly is the way the majority of the respondents want to go. It also appears that people are leaning more toward meeting in person but would like to keep the option for having "virtual" meetings as needed. I'm perfectly fine with that approach and will basically determine physical vs. virtual for each meeting based on expected attendance, number of presenters, scope of material, etc.<br /><br />For the first meeting, I'd definitely like to have it in person so that we can all put names to faces. With Knowledge11 drawing near, I think it best if we hold off on our first meeting until sometime after the conference. For the moment, I'm leaning towards sometime the week of June 20th.<br /><br />Assuming we stick with that week, does anyone want to volunteer to "HOST" the meeting or have any suggestions on a facility we could contact? (feel free to just comment on this blog entry or e-mail me directly).</p>
