<p>Over the past several months I have been involved with star ServiceNow developer, David Loo, in the creation of a plugin to integrate ServiceNow's incident system with Verizon eBonding.<br /><br />We have been flooded with demo requests from ServiceNow customers that are interested in this plugin. In order to provide an instantaneous demo for customers, I have created this video that provides the demo that explains the integration and shows how it looks to the end user.<br /><br />Click on the image below to view the video from my personal blog:<br /><a href='http://www.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/demo-of-verizon-ebonding-with-servicenow.html'><img src='http://www.john-james-andersen.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide01-300x225.jpg' /></a><br /><br />The video will soon be available on the wiki documentation page for Verizon eBonding as well.</p>
