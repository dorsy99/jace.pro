<p>The h.e.l.p Blog 4/8/11<br />(here everybody learns plenty)<br /><br />I am sure you all missed me last week, but I am back and excited for this week's blog.<br /><br />Over the past two weeks among our other activities we have been working a lot with the documentation team on a few different projects. Some of those projects include helping tag the recently redesigned Wiki page (http://wiki.service-now.com) and also Davida has been feverishly testing and editing numerous gliderecord scripts, mostly in business rules. If you don't know about business rules:<br /><br />"A business rule is a piece of JavaScript configured to run when a record is displayed, inserted, updated, deleted, or when a table is queried."<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Business_Rules<br /><br />These are extremely helpful and can be used for a variety of things. <br /><br />This is a little more advanced since it does require Java script but if you have some coding knowledge you can really leverage gliderecord scripts to do various things (http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideRecord). Honestly we have only been working from examples that we were given to test but I think it would be really cool if you have a gliderecord script you use or even a nifty business rule you use, post it here! Let us see what you got! <br /><br />If you haven't already please follow the blog, I know it's not a competition but the goal is to catch SlightlyLoony.</p>
