My instance has <i>lots</i> abnormal data, because nobody has ever tried to clean it up, and it's more than three years old. I had many "messy" fields to choose from, so I started with an easy one: the CPU Type field on the computer form.<br /><br />The first step is to create a <i>configuration</i> in the <b>Field Normalization</b> application. Configurations come in two flavors: a normalization or a transformation. In this case I could readily identify a handful of "normal" values that I wanted to end up with (Xeon, Pentium, SPARC, etc.) — so <i>normalization</i>, not transformation, is what I need. So I clicked on <b>Field Normalization â†’ Normalizations</b> and then clicked "New"…<br /><!--break--><br /><img __jive_id="6848" alt="Screen shot 2011-01-18 at 9.28.24 AM_0.png" class="jive-image" style="width: imagecache/Small/SlightlyLoony/screenshots/Screen shot 2011-01-18 at 9.28.24 AM_0.png; height: auto;" />A few seconds later, I had the screen at right. Here's what each of those fields does:<br /><ul><li><i>Name</i>: This is a human-readable name, not used by the system at all. It's here so you can give the normalization a convenient moniker that makes sense to you.</li><li><i>Table</i>: A mandatory field that specifies the table being normalized. The choice list shows all the tables in your instance, as you can normalize a field in any of them. As you might imagine, it's important to get this setting right! I want this field to be normalized in <i>all</i> kinds of computers, not just some of them — so I'm defining this normalization in the base computer table. If I had only wanted this normalization to apply to (say) Windows server, I'd have defined it in that table instead.</li><li><i>Field</i>: Another mandatory field, this one specifying the field to be normalized. The choice list shows all the fields from the table specified above that have a type that can be normalized (these types are defined in <b>Field Normalization â†’ Normalization Field Types</b>, which I'll talk more about in a later post). All you need to do here is to pick your abnormal field.</li><li>Mode: There are three choices here — "Off", "Test", and "Active". When you first create a configuration, this will default to Test, and that's where you want it. Choosing Off does just what you'd think: it turns this normalization off completely. Choosing Test means that the normalization will work for you (actually, anyone with the "normalizer_tester" role) but won't affect either other users or existing (extant) data. Choosing Active means that this normalization is rockin' and rollin': it will work for all users, and you can go back and "fix" all your messy extant data. Test mode is exactly what you want while you're developing and testing a new configuration.</li><li><i>Normalize query</i>: Checking this box enables normalization on certain kinds of queries (from the user interface or from scripts — much more on this in a later post). Currently, queries with an <i>is</i> or <i>is not</i> (or <i>==</i> or <i>!=</i> in a script) operator can be normalized. For example, if you were to create a filter that said "CPU Type is Intel Xeon L3344", it would be normalized into "CPU Type is Xeon". Naturally, if you uncheck the box, this behavior doesn't happen.</li><li><i>Coalesce each normal</i>: You'll want to be very, very careful with this checkbox — it's powerful and sometimes very useful, but it can result in records being automatically deleted. I'll talk much more about this in a later post. For the purposes of the CPU Type field, I don't want this feature, so it's not checked.</li><li><i>Raw field</i>: This choice defaults to "none", and often that's what you'll want. But in this case, I wanted to keep the value that was actually stored to the record, before normalization. To do this, I created a new field <i>Raw CPU Type</i> (it could have had any name, of course) <i>before</i> I created this configuration. Then I simply selected it from the choice list. Now each time a value is written to a computer record, the normalized value goes into the CPU Type field, and the <i>raw</i> (i.e., not normalized) value goes into the Raw CPU Type field. That lets me find or report on the data either way, which can be quite useful.</li></ul><br />Whew! That's about enough for one day, don'tcha think?</p>
