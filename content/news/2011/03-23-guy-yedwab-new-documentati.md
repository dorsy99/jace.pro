<p>Hi all,<br /><br />We've put out a quick new doc about defining locations, including info about the location hierarchy:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Defining_Locations<br /><br />If you have any information about locations that you've learned the hard way in the field that you think new administrators should probably know, let me know and I'll see if it belongs in this doc.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Service-now.com Documentation</p>
