<p>Today I've been testing our Change Management conflict detection functionality.<br /><br />This feature allows Change Managers, and Change Advisory Boards to spot potential issues, and be more aware of the risks involved in authorising change.<br /><br />A Change Record might be conflicted for a couple of reasons:<br /><ul><li>The change window occurs outside of a Maintenance Window. <i>"Not in Maintenance Window"</i></li><li>The change window overlaps with another Change Record against the same component of the Infrastructure (The same Configuration Item) <i>"CI already scheduled"</i></li><li>The change occurs during a defined Blackout Window, where no changes should occur to this CI <i>"Blackout"</i></li><li>A relationship exists with a parent/child CI and the Change occurs when that CI isn't available for Change. <i>"Parent/Child CI already scheduled</i></li></ul><br /><br />The last conflict type in the table above shows that change conflict detection is also aware of relationships defined between CI's - for example, if a SAN provides storage for a server, does the change occur during a valid maintenance window for that server?<br /><br />It's an incredibly powerful feature in ServiceNow, over the next couple of blog posts I want to show you how this is a great help making the right assessment of a Change.<br /><br /><h2>"Not in Maintenance Window"</h2><br /><br />My demo organisation allows maintenance on servers on the 24th and 25th September. <br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="44dd7086db5c9304b322f4621f961963.iix" /><br /><br />My first example shows a Change record that has a window that falls outside of the maintenance window.<br /><br />The first thing to do is define a period of time that you are happy for changes to be made.<br /><br />These can be found in <b>Change &gt; Maintenance Windows</b><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="c2a9984edb1c17041dcaf3231f9619fc.iix" /><br /><br />When creating a maintenance window you can define the type of CI that is included, as well as a schedule.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="4af8bb79dbd05fc03eb27a9e0f9619c1.iix" /><br /><br />In my example I've specified that the CI type must be Server, and the Location attribute must be London for this CI to be included in the Maintenance Window.<br /><br />The schedule entry interface is quite granular - you can easily specify recurring schedules, for example every 4th weekend is available for maintenance.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="c4956d4edb50d7049c9ffb651f9619d0.iix" /><br /><br />You can see in the image below that <i>CHG0030013 - Install application X</i> isn't valid as it's scheduled on Friday 23rd September, before my maintenance window opens.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="2eeff739db985704ed6af3231f96193a.iix" /><br /><br />The system will verify this for you when you click <b>Check Conflicts</b><br /><br />At the top of the form you are warned <b>There ARE CONFLICTS - See "Conflicts" related list</b><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="09128d82dbdc9304b322f4621f9619de.iix" /><br /><br />To get more detail on the conflict you need to add the Conflicts related list to your form - it isn't there by default. Do this by right-clicking the bar and selecting <b>Personalize &gt; Related Lists</b> Here you can add in the <b>Conflict -&gt; Change</b> related list.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="00882d8edb58d7041dcaf3231f961945.iix" /><br /><br />At the bottom of your Change Record you now have more information about the conflict including the reason why the change is in conflict. <b>Not in maintenance window!</b><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="224f50cadb9c9fc068c1fb651f961939.iix" /><br /><br />The first example is a simple one, but it shows you the power of being able to quickly, and repeatably assess whether a change is valid or not.<br /><br />Lastly - you can see the conflict status in List form as well as using the status as a filter.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="de16890adb9897041dcaf3231f9619df.iix" /><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="184cd802db9c9704ed6af3231f961906.iix" /><br /><br />Next blog post I'll cover the <b>CI already scheduled</b> type of Conflict status.<br /><br />Read more about <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Change_Management_Collision_Detector" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Change_Management_Collision_Detector">Change Management Conflict Detection</a> on the ServiceNow Wiki.<br /><br />Have a great weekend!<br /><br />Read also:<br /><ul><li><a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-2" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-2">Change Management conflict checking - Part 2</a></li><li><a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/crowdsourcing-why-do-you-declare-blackout-windows" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/crowdsourcing-why-do-you-declare-blackout-windows">Crowdsourcing: Why do you declare Blackout Windows?</a><br /></li></ul></p>
