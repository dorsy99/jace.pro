<p>I wonder what other folks are doings related to supporting guest accounts? Looking to poll information on how many people are allowing this, and what is the authentication method in place?<br /><br />We have a conflict of using SSO and trying to support guests through the CMS.<br /><br />Looking for the community feedback related to this.</p>
