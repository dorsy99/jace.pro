<p>ServiceNow has partnered with Kryterion, the award-winning SaaS testing platform used by both Google and Salesforce.com, to offer two options for taking the new ServiceNow Certified System Administrator Exam. For both of these testing options, results are displayed immediately after the exam is submitted.<br/><br/>Kryterion has a network of Test Centers around the world. Using Webassessor's registration process, you can choose a location, date, and time so a system will be reserved for you. You may also elect to take the exam using your own system during a scheduled online-proctored session.<br/><br/><span>We realize that some certification candidates may be far from a Test Center, so an online proctored version of the exam is available. This testing option lets you use your own system outfitted with a compliant camera to take the Exam while a live proctor monitors your session. After defining a biometric profile (reusable for other tests) you can schedule to test with the results delivered when the exam is submitted.
