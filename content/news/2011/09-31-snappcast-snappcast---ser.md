<p>Matt Gaide, Brad Tilton, and myself [edit](Matt Beran)[/edit] have started a Service-Now video podcast. Think of it like webinars or show-and-tells without all the pain of having to be marketed to, the freedom to show off your cool stuff, and the flexibility of editing after recording so you look more brilliant than ever.<br /><br />We have an instance dedicated to showing off cool builds/tricks etc. in case you can't get corporate or legal approval to show your instance.<br /><br />Interested in showing off your skills? Send us an e-mail: snappcast (at) gmail.com - all are welcome.</p>
