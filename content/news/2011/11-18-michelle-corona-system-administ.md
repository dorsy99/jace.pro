<p>During our System Administration courses, our Instructors encourage the use of the Live Feed Social IT feature to post questions, talk about nearby restaurants, and discuss topics related to the course experience. Everyone in the ServiceNow Training Group monitors the class feeds to answer curriculum questions and advocate for our favorite eateries!<br/><br/>During one of Sean McClean's classes, a question was asked about WSDLs: if a field is added to a table, does the WSDL automatically update?<br/><br/>There are two parts to the answer because WSDLs fall into one of two types. ServiceNow automatically generates dynamic WSDLs. If a dynamic WSDL is used in an integration, it updates automatically and will include changes like a new field.<br/><br/>The other type of WSDL is referred to as static because the integration requires a specific, fixed WSDL structure. If a static WSDL is used, then the WSDL must be updated manually if the data being passed is involved in the change to the table. One of our most popular integrations (Verizon eBonding) uses a static WSDL.<br/><br/>Read more about static WSDLs on this excellent wiki page:<br/><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Creating_a_Static_WSDL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Creating_a_Static_WSDL</a><br/><br/>Keep those questions coming!</p>
