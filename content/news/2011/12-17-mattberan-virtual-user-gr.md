<p>I was thinking we should get the virtual user group going again? Let me know if you agree.<br /><br />[edit]The virtual user group is what we make it. You want to do video chats about it and ask questions to the development team at Service-Now, let's do it. You want more show and tells, let's do it. It is what we make it.
