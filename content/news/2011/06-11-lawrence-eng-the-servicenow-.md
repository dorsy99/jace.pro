<p>If you ever wanted some ServiceNow gear featuring our brand new logo, your wait is over! Earlier today, we debuted the <a title="w.servicenowgear.com/" href="http://www.servicenowgear.com/">ServiceNow Company Store</a>--open to our customers, partners, employees, or anyone else with impeccable taste in SaaS for ITSM.<br /><br />I know there's a ServiceNow hat and a couple of shirts in my future. What are you planning to buy? What else would you like to see in the store?<br /><br />Happy Friday,<br />Lawrence<br /><br />PS: I'm going to try getting some of this stuff to give away in contests we'll hold here on the community, on <a title="w.facebook.com/pages/Service-nowcom-IT-Service-Management-SaaS/70876467572?ref=ts" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Service-nowcom-IT-Service-Management-SaaS/70876467572?ref=ts">Facebook</a>, <a title="itter.com/servicenow" href="http://twitter.com/servicenow">Twitter</a>, etc.</p>
