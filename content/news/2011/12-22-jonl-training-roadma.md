<p>Hi everyone - as we look forward to the big party in New Orleans, I wanted to provide an updated roadmap for our training offerings. As we launched our Scripting class at K11, it seems only fitting to blow out the Advanced Admin class in LA. Currently in development, it will eventually be a 3 day class, but of course, we'll have to squish it down a little for the two-day format of the pre-conference training. I won't give away all the topics, but expect deep hands-on experience with integrations, web services, security, adv reporting and adv workflows (and more!). <br/><br/><span>You'll also find a killer G2G3 simulation session with ServiceNow built right in! How cool is that? If you aren't familiar with this, check out </span><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://g2g3.com/p_psitsm.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://g2g3.com/p_psitsm.html</a><span>. It will blow your mind.</span><br/><br/><span>As always, feedback and thoughts are appreciated. We carefully review our comments and csat scores on classes and are constantly working to continue to improve our courseware through customer and instructor feedback. You can always reach out to me directly as well (</span><a title="k-email-small" class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:jon.lloyd@service-now.com">jon.lloyd@service-now.com</a><span>) to let us know how we're doing. </span><br/><br/>All the best,<br/>jon</p>
