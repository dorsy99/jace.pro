<p>We've had Field Styles forever. We've had Reference Styles for a little while (where you can make ALL reference fields for a given table a certain width, for example).<br /><br />Do you want to style variables?<br /><br />I've got a way to make Reference Variables honor Reference Styles for their respective table. Took about 10 minutes. But it's only a partial solution, so it's not good enough.<br /><br />We could also add a "Style" field to the variable form, let you specify a CSS style per variable as desired.<br /><br />What do you think? Any interest?</p>
