<p>From time-to-time I'd like to tap into the ServiceNow community (i.e. you lot) to get feedback and crowdsource some information. This would really help as the AppDev team move between products.<br /><br />It would be great to capture requirements, use cases and ideas in the comment threads - so please get involved. My last post on <a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1">"Change Management conflict checking - Part 1"</a> has had 145 reads overnight so... could we get a couple of discussions started here.<br /><br />I'm trying to gather together use cases for the Blackout Window feature in our Change Management application. Blackout Windows are used to control when Changes can't be made .<br /><br />Blackout Windows are:<br /><ul><li>Associated with a class of CI. In the example below only Servers are affected by this Blackout Window, although you could choose <b>Configuration Item</b> for a total blackout</li><li>Filtered. You can restrict the scope of the Blackout to a particular location, type of server - any attribute you want to filter on</li><li>Can have multiple schedules associated. Perhaps a better example would have been a single Blackout Window for ACME servers with 4 end-of-quarter schedules associated.<br /></li></ul><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="905e77fddbd4d3049c9ffb651f96195b.iix" /><br /><br />In my last company we used the term "Change freeze" to denote when changes couldn't happen. <br /><br />My examples are:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table><tr><th>Reason</th><th>Duration</th><th>Scope</th></tr><tr><td>End of Financial Quarter</td><td>4 times a year for a week</td><td>All Financial systems, storage and network</td></tr><tr><td>End of Financial Year</td><td>Once a year for a week</td><td>All Financial systems, storage and network</td></tr><tr><td>Releasing a big industry report on the Internet</td><td>Ad-hoc</td><td>All web systems, database and network</td></tr><tr><td>In some European countries that shut down for summer</td><td>A month annually</td><td>All local office</td></tr><tr><td>Christmas!</td><td>A week annually</td><td>All systems</td></tr></table><br /><br />I'd be interested in your experiences of the types of events or conditions that cause a Change Freeze or Blackout Window, I'm going to use your feedback as use cases to test the Blackout Window functionality before the next release.<br /><br />Thanks!</p>
