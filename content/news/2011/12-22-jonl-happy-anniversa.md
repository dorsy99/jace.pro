<p>Hey, it almost slipped right by me. Did you know that the training team at ServiceNow is ONE year old?! We've come a long way in the last twelve months, and now have a fantastic team of curriculum developers and technical trainers, supported by some amazing folks in our Services group, Support and our Customer Success Managers. We couldn't have made it where we are today without them, and without you, our incredible customers. Thank you.<br/><br/>We are deeply grateful for the feedback and support you've given us over the past year. But we're just getting started - stay tuned for another post about what the new year will bring!<br/><br/>Happy holidays,<br/>jon</p>
