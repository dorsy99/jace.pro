<p>Despite our lengthly wiki article on the <a href='http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Embedded:SAML_2.0'>SAML 2.0 plugin</a>, I still get a lot of calls from customers who want to know the general steps to setting up SAML 2.0 with their ServiceNow instance.<br /><br />In order to provide better help up front, I have created a video that demonstrates the steps that are required to take in order to set up the SAML 2.0 plugin in ServiceNow with SSOCircle.com, a free, public Identity Provider (IdP).<br /><br />While companies will not typically use SSOCircle.com as their identity provider, it allows me to demonstrate the basic steps that an individual would need to take in order to set up their ServiceNow instance with their own IdP.<br /><br />I have also taken the liberty to post this video both on <a href='http://www.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/configuring-servicenow-for-saml-2-0.html'>my personal blog</a>, as well as on the wiki. Hopefully this video will provide customers with a better sense of what is needed when starting out their SAML 2.0 single sign-on projects.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Video_Tutorial_Configuring_SAML_2.0_Plugin'><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="dff37c42db9cd704ed6af3231f9619c1.iix" width='500' /></a></center><br /><br />Direct link to wiki page:<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Video_Tutorial_Configuring_SAML_2.0_Plugin<br /><br />Overall SAML 2.0 documentation page (contains link to the video as well):<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Embedded:SAML_2.0</p>
