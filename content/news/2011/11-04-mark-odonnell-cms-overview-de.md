<p>Jeff had some very good insights yesterday and although our presentations involved speaking to a simplified deck, I hope you still get some value from the power point slides. Take note of slide 11 where Jeff describes the resources and process involved with going to production. <br /><br />1 non-technical design resource, 1 technical development resource<br /><br />4 months from design to final product</p>
