<p>While going through my most recent implementation I'm finding a lot of points where I wish there was more content out-of-box. To be absolutely clear; I'm not talking about demo data.<br /><br />One such thing is e-mail notifications. Now I know that "it depends" on the environment and how process is defined, but my expectations are much higher than what is provided out of box. What I would expect is the ability to go into notifications and simply look at the notifications related to change and simply cherry-pick the notifications I would like to include and toggle the Active Boolean on each one, maybe massage the content or the subjects a little.<br /><br />The real reason behind this blog post is simply to be a gathering ground for content you think should be more 'complete' out of box, as well as for my own list. So add to the comments below, and if you have example content, POST IT!</p>
