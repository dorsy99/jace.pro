<p>Being keen followers of the community website (blogs and forums) us ServiceNow development folk often see good ideas, requests for help and issues reported by our customers.<br /><br />Often we get inspiration from our customers - Like <a title="witter.com/#!/Stamon74/status/118425111169732608" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Stamon74/status/118425111169732608">Chris Damon who tweeted out a request for Incident timelines</a> and <a title="witter.com/#!/Stamon74/status/118729750922543104" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Stamon74/status/118729750922543104">got a prototype a day later</a><br /><br /><blockquote><br /><a title="itter.com/j_roberts" href="http://twitter.com/j_roberts">@j_roberts</a> Ha! I'm not that impatient. From tweet to delivered functionality...social media win! Thank you!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I thought it would be handy to have a more convenient way to create ServiceNow records straight from the browser.<br /><br />Here is the <a title="hrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mncpffchenlpeichcdeemalkeailegil" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mncpffchenlpeichcdeemalkeailegil">totally unofficial Google Chrome extension for ServiceNow.</a> <br /><br /><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mncpffchenlpeichcdeemalkeailegil"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="4f96ac4adbd0dfc068c1fb651f9619fe.iix" /></a><br /><br />The extension is used by right clicking a webpage and selecting one of the following options:<br /><br /><ul><li>Go to your instance</li><li>Create an Incident</li><li>Create a Problem</li><li>Create a Defect (Requires the SDLC module on your instance)</li><li>Create an Enhancement Request(Requires the SDLC module on your instance)</li><li>Search the Wiki (If you select some text and right click)</li><li>Go to the wiki</li></ul><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="dee30c46db5c5704ed6af3231f9619e5.iix" /><br /><br />The extension creates (and saves) the record, then opens it in a new tab for you to add detail.<br /><br />Now we can be browsing through the forums, spot a great idea or a customer needing help and get it into ServiceNow with a few clicks.<br /><br />I though this might also be handy for people who use webmail - if you have one of those out-of-band IT support type emails just select the text, right-click and off you go.<br /><br />It's early code, but in my testing it works fairly well. I did have a few 500 errors, which went away with a restart of Chrome.<br /><br />Don't forget to configure the extension with your instance, username and password.<br /><br />Have fun!</p>
