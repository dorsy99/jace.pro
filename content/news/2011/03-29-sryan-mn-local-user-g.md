<p>This event management system doesn't allow for experimentation without actually creating an event. The idea I had that would allow folks to choose in which part of the meeting they wanted to participate didn't actually work - you could only select one. SO --- I'm creating two new events - one for the config/discovery lab and one for the local user group meeting. You'll need to register TWICE if you plan to attend both. Sorry for the extra communications.</p>
