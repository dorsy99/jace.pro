<p>I just found out today that, for the first time ever, the majority of sessions at our upcoming user conference will be presented by customers. That's a huge milestone. I've always liked customer talks for two reasons. First, because they impart more knowledge than information, giving me actual solutions to take back and implement. Second, the presenters are usually willing to go into more depth with you one-on-one, which can lead to lasting relationships.<br /><br />Check it out here:<br />http://blog.service-now.com/Blog/<br /><br />Cheers,</p>
