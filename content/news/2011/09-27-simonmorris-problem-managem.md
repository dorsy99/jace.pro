<p>The ITILv3 Problem Management process diagram does a nice job of showing the lifecycle of a Problem - generation, categorisation, prioritisation - Workaround, Known Error and hopefully resolution.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="eed9e0c6db909344e9737a9e0f96196c.iix" /><br /><br />( I found that image on a <a title="w.cisco.com/en/US/technologies/tk869/tk769/technologies_white_paper0900aecd806c3eee.html" href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/technologies/tk869/tk769/technologies_white_paper0900aecd806c3eee.html">Cisco Problem Management whitepaper which is worth a read.</a>)<br /><br />A visualisation concept that I'm fond of is <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane">swim lane diagrams,</a> which take a process flow and overlays areas of responsibility. <br /><ul><li>Who logs the problem record</li><li>Who categorises and prioritises the Problem</li><li>Who works on the Workaround, Known Error and Resolution</li><li>Who resolves and closes the record</li></ul><br /><br />I've posted below an example swim chart diagram for Problem Management, it isn't complete just yet. At the bottom of this page you can download the Omnigraffle file if you would like to edit it.<br /><br /><img  class="jive-image" src="e368c40adb109704ed6af3231f961951.iix" alt="Problem Management" height="540" width="750" /><br /><br />Of course you may prefer the more realistic version of Problem Management - I blurred out the naughty words on the version for the community site - click through for the ruder one!<br /><br /><a href="http://workflow-process.com/2011/03/28/incident-management-4/"><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="6677608adb54d704ed6af3231f961980.iix" /></a></p>
