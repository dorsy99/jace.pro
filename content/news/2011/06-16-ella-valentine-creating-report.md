<p>I have a couple questions:<br />1. Has anyone used role based functionality to create reports/homepages for non licensed users?<br />2. When you create your gauge and set up the home page, is it dirllable and if so how did you make it that way from incident module (will be drillable from other tables..problem for sure)<br /><br />Appreciate the input...FYI, we have been able to creat the page/report but it will provide limited data (I am not able to get the work notes on the gauge for non licensed users - assuming it is becuase they don't have license and it is a writable field)</p>
