<p>We're lucky enough to gain the participation of a number of Service-now employees as moderators for our forums. Right now, it's mostly on a volunteer basis (they all have day jobs, of course), but in the near future we expect to have some full-time community hosts. The whole idea is facilitate conversations, create solutions, and make the forums a cleaner, faster, more fulfilling place. <br /><br />Moderators can be identified by the red badge (of courage?). You should see them around more and more in the coming weeks. If you have any feedback, please post in reply. <br /><br />Cheers,</p>
