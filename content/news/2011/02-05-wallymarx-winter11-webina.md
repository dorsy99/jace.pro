<p>We had great attendance for our Winter11 Customer Webinar. With so many people participating there was an overflow of conversation. Rather than dump all of it in one post, I'm breaking into sections and posting separately. If you have a follow-up question, please post below and I'll get it answered for you.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Wally<br /><br /><br />Q: You said at the beginning that the hotel is filling fast - we cannot register to arrive Saturday night so we can go to the scripting class Sunday/Monday. The hotel says we must talk to K11 folks, so when do I start to panic?<br />A: Don't panic! 93 Rooms were available for Saturday night check-in at the time of this writing—however all space at the hotel is on a first-come first-served basis. Please know we have reserved the entire property at this wonderful island oasis in Mission Bay called Paradise Point—but my advice is to book early to guarantee you space at Knowledge11. We'd like to hear from you at knowledge@service-now.com or call us at 877.613.6976.<br /><br />Q: Will you be building an out of the box inventory management module - not asset management but can also tie to the cmdb<br />A: We have no immediate plans to create this<br /><br />Q: Last release webinar, Accessibility was discussed, what progress has been made towards making Service Now's interface accessible <br />A: Accessibility is part of the effort for every release. New functionality is tested as it is created <br /><br />Q: Is Cognos included on the list of BI applications that can now connect?<br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: We were told ability to report on fields on audit table would be opened up with this release - within the SN report capability?<br />A: Bulk reports off the audit table have not been enabled. However, a capability to view the audit history for an individual record in a tabular format, with full search &amp; filter capabilities has been added.<br /><br />Q: I realize that this release did not include any noteworthy updates to the reports capabilities -- do you have any plans to do enhancements to reports in the future? Specifically around formatting of list reports -- ex: ability to control column widths in list report output, ability to have list reports support wrapping text to a second or even third line if you want to include more fields per record than can fit on a a single line, etc).<br />A: We do plan to do additional work on the reporting module to improve the capabilities of our in-product reports, but we can't provide any specific plans or dates at this stage. Note that this release does include our ODBC driver, so customers wanting to product byte-perfect reports can do so in a third party reporting tool.<br /><br />Q: Are all the changes plug-ins or will we see visual changes on any of our forms?<br />A: The changes will be delivered in different ways (depending on the feature). Information about which functionality will be enable via plugin will be documented in the wiki at release<br /><br />Q: Is it possible to get incident reports...monthly...quarterly? Aging reports and how long it takes to close a ticket.<br />A: There is currently a project out of the Technical Support department, which should be completed within the next few weeks. That will make this type of information available to customers on HI at any time. As part of this we will enable ad-hoc reporting functionality for customers so that they can report one the data in any way they choose.</p>
