<p>Seems like everyone is trying to get more organized these days (remember that New Year's resolution?). One thing that is tough to organize is important documents, such as policies, procedures, contracts, whitepapers, forms, knowledge articles, and compliance information. The new Document Management application can help. You can store documents, control access, track revisions, manage approvals, and share documents with others.
