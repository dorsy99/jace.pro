<p>We are currently doing a project to revise our Knowledge Management processes. When reviewing the format of the existing knowledge articles in our database, someone on the project team suggested possibly changing the Topics that are used today. We are wondering what other people are using for Topics to organize their knowledge articles in the database. Any ideas sent our way would be appreciated.</p>
