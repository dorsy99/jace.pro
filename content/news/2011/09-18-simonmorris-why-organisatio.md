<p>My last couple of blog posts have been about Change Management and the idea of checking for conflicting RFCs. ( <a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1">Part 1</a>, <a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-2" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-2">Part 2</a> ).<br /><br />It's a great feature in ServiceNow that is available now and <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=October2011_Release_Notes#New_in_This_Release" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=October2011_Release_Notes#New_in_This_Release">is enhanced in the October 2011 release</a>, according to the latest release notes.<br /><br />The fact that Blackout and Maintenance schedules now have condition fields leads to some interesting usage examples. It's obviously a handy thing to have in larger organisations where, for example, the London Infrastructure team will have a different maintenance schedule to their New York colleagues.<br /><br />I wondered how organisations might use this new functionality and so asked around, firstly on <a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/crowdsourcing-why-do-you-declare-blackout-windows" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/crowdsourcing-why-do-you-declare-blackout-windows">my ServiceNow blog</a> and also on <a title="w.linkedin.com/groups/Why-do-organisations-declare-Change-51930.S.70061031?qid=f38096b3-1c47-4138-8ca5-61ee3b969250&trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl&goback=%2Egmp_51930" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Why-do-organisations-declare-Change-51930.S.70061031?qid=f38096b3-1c47-4138-8ca5-61ee3b969250&amp;trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl&amp;goback=%2Egmp_51930">Linkedin.</a><br /><br />With the exception of <a title="itter.com/#!/servicenow/status/113310702260850688" href="http://twitter.com/#!/servicenow/status/113310702260850688">one snarky commentator</a> (just joking!), I got a really informative response - certainly enough to help with the testing.<br /><br />I thought I'd collate the results into a blog post.<br /><br /><h2>Why do organisations Blackout Windows (or Change Freezes)</h2><br /><p><br /></p><ul><li>In the Education sector during the first week of school/college and during final exam week.</li><li>In local Government during city wide training exercises, changes in working practice</li><li>In local Government during elections</li><li>In national Government around political events (Independance Day, State of the Union)</li><li>In national Government around sporting events (London Olympics)</li><li>Common use cases:<br /> <ul><li>Financial cycles (year and quarter end)</li><li>Executive conferences</li><li>During holiday season when technical resource is light</li><li>During deployment of a new product where changes need to be isolated</li><li><b><u>During an activity of high change</u></b></li></ul><br /></li></ul><br /><br />My favourite example is the last one - During an activity of high change. <br /><br />During a period where you have a high volume of Change, or perhaps a lower volume of change on critical systems a freeze might be necessary. Maybe to isolate non-critical changes that might muddy the Problem Management process if you have implementation issues.<br /><br />I was also interested in the concept of Change Freeze versus "Change Frost" and "Change Thaw". Or in ServiceNow terminology "Blackout" versus.... well, we need to think up some other colours :-)<br /><br />More than one large organisation that I know of has the concept of a period of freeze where SOME changes are allowed. <br /><br />I think that a Utopian Change Management system should take into consideration the risk profile of a Change record, and the state of Blackout windows and give guidance on whether this change is acceptable. The system could also take outstanding Incidents against CIs - don't make Change against components that currently have unrelated faults for example.<br /><br />Change conflict detection is designed to give guidance on the suitability of a Change, and it's a major step forward - but there's lots more work we can do in this area to make the assessment of Change more predicatable and basically "clever".<br /><br />Approving a Request For Change record is basically an acceptance of risk - there are a lot of "signals" that can be taken into consideration.<br /><br />Thanks for the responses that everyone gave - the Linkedin discussion thread is well worth a read.<br /><br /><ul><li><a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/crowdsourcing-why-do-you-declare-blackout-windows" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/crowdsourcing-why-do-you-declare-blackout-windows">My original blog post</a></li><li><a title="w.linkedin.com/groups/Why-do-organisations-declare-Change-51930.S.70061031?qid=f38096b3-1c47-4138-8ca5-61ee3b969250&trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl&goback=%2Egmp_51930" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Why-do-organisations-declare-Change-51930.S.70061031?qid=f38096b3-1c47-4138-8ca5-61ee3b969250&amp;trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl&amp;goback=%2Egmp_51930">Linkedin discussion</a></li><li><a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=October2011_Release_Notes#New_in_This_Release" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=October2011_Release_Notes#New_in_This_Release">ServiceNow October 2011 release notes</a></li><li><a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Change_Management_Collision_Detector" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Change_Management_Collision_Detector">Conflict detection on the Wiki</a></li><li><a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-1">Change Management conflict checking - Part 1</a><br /></li><li><a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-2" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/simonmorris/change-management-conflict-checking-part-2">Change Management conflict checking - Part 2</a></li></ul></p>
