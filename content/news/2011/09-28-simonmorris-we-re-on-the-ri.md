<p>Glen O'Donnell revealed some early numbers from his, soon to be released, <a title="w.zdnet.com/blog/forrester/new-study-yields-eye-opening-it-service-management-benefits/732" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/forrester/new-study-yields-eye-opening-it-service-management-benefits/732">Forrester survey on the impact of IT Service Management in organisations.</a><br /><br />It provides reassuring data-based results showing that ITSM has a significant impact on businesses - although taking the data sample from US qualified ITSM people might have inflated the results.<br /><br /><ul><li>85% said ITSM had a positive impact on organisational productivity, 2% disagreed.</li><li>83% said ITSM had a positive impact on service quality, 1% disagreed.</li><li>65% said ITSM had a positive impact on ITs reputation with the business, 3% disagreed.</li></ul><br /><br />So, all good news. I hope the survey helps justify the cost of ITSM in the eyes of business stakeholders, and will give these types of projects more clout and credibility.<br /><br />Most interestingly, for me, was the 77% who felt that a good relationship existed between the IT Operations organisation and the Development organisation. I'll hold comment until I've read the report but I wonder if this will calm the debate about "<a title="w.itskeptic.org/devops-and-itil" href="http://www.itskeptic.org/devops-and-itil">DevOps and ITIL</a>". <br /><br />I don't think the report will go into detail about how the 2 organisations are interacting better, and enhancing the relationship, but I hope that amongst ServiceNow customers functionality such as <a title="w.service-now.com/release-SDLC.do" href="http://www.service-now.com/release-SDLC.do">SDLC</a> and <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Release_Management_Tools#SDLC_-_SCRUM_Plugin" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Release_Management_Tools#SDLC_-_SCRUM_Plugin">the Scrum application</a> help.<br /><br />As <a title="itter.com/#!/ITSMBrian/status/118714442446946304" href="http://twitter.com/#!/ITSMBrian/status/118714442446946304">Brian Hollandsworth tweeted</a> from Fusion11:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />Release mgmt tightly integrates to Chg, CMDB, Incident, Problem, Project, SDLC, Knowledge.
