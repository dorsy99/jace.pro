<p>I'm really pleased that our Scripting classes at Knowledge were a huge success, scores were 93% satisfaction with 95 participants. I'm happy to report we've released our schedule for the next several months, hitting our usual destinations of San Diego, New York and Chicago. Our first UK class will be on July 19-20 and we're finalizing that on the schedule for you to register (next week). Pricing for the 2-day class is $1195. <br/><br/>To register, please go to the Hi portal &gt; Self-Service &gt; Service Catalog &gt; Training Registration.<br/><br/>All the best,<br/>jon</p>
