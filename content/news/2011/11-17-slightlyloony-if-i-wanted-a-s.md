Part of that customization involved making a few business rules, and this reminded her of a long-standing question she had. "What on earth" she asked "does it mean when I select <i>async</i> for when a business rule runs? And why would I ever want to make that choice, whatever it means?"<br /><br />Harriet knew all about <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Business_Rules" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Business_Rules">our Wiki page on Business Rules</a>; that was how she learned out to do them in the first place. But what it says about <i>async</i> business rules just wasn't clicking with her. They remained a deep mystery, and this mystery was causing her to lose sleep.<br /><br />Well, ok, I made up that last part. But here's the answer I gave her:<br /><!--break--><br />If you're not familiar with the term <i>async</i>, it's short for <i>asynchronous</i>, which in turn means <i>not synchronous</i>, or not happening at the same time. In the context of a business rule, what this means is that the <i>script</i> inside the business rule doesn't run at the same time.<br /><br /><span class="asset-asset_lightbox-Small asset-align-right"><a href="/files/SlightlyLoony/Screen%20shot%202011-11-16%20at%207.37.10%20AM.png" rel="lightbox"><img rel="lightbox" src="http://community.service-now.com/files/imagecache/Small/SlightlyLoony/Screen%20shot%202011-11-16%20at%207.37.10%20AM.png" alt="" title="" class="imagecache imagecache-Small" /></a></span>Let's use an example (at right, click to enlarge) to illustrate.<br /><br />This business rule is triggered whenever a record in the <i>Change Request</i> table is updated, and the condition below is met:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;color:FireBrick;"><br />current.category=="Service-now Deployment"&amp;&amp; current.approval=="approved"&amp;&amp; current.state=="2"<br /></pre><br />The condition is evaluated <i>synchronously</i>, meaning at the same time the record is updated. For <i>async</i> business rules, the condition is always evaluated <i>after</i> the database operation (the update, in the case of our example). It's what happens next that differentiates the <i>async</i> business rules...<br /><br />For other kinds of business rules, the <i>script</i> inside the business rule is executed <i>synchronously</i>, or at the same time that the business rule is triggered. This is the behavior you're familiar with. If our example was an <i>after</i> business rule instead of an <i>async</i> business rule, its script would run at the same time the business rule was triggered.<br /><br />For <i>async</i> business rules, however, this is not the case. Instead, when an <i>async</i> business rule is triggered, all that happens is that a scheduled job is created to run the script in the business rule as soon as possible, but <i>at some point in the future</i>. This could be a second or two, or several minutes, or even more — it depends on how many scheduled jobs are backlogged at the moment the business rule runs. <br /><br />Ok, that's <i>what</i> happens — but <i>why</i> would you want to do this? Our example shows a great reason: the script in this business rule makes a web services call. This might take several seconds to run. If this business rule were <i>not</i> asynchronous, the update of the user's screen would pause while the script making the web services call ran. <i>That's</i> the main reason to use an <i>async</i> business rule: to do something that takes longer than you'd like the user to wait, and that doesn't <i>have</i> to be done before the user's screen is updated.<br /><br />So, Harriet, there you go!</p>
