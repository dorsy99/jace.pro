<p>As we revisit our core ITSM applications I've been diving back into the ITIL books, both version 3 and 2011.<br /><br />We are all familiar with the ITIL "magic roundabout" - a visualisation that demonstrates how the 3 volumes - Service Operation, Transition and Design - rotate around Service Strategy with an outer crust of Continual Service Improvement keeping it all together. <br /><br /><!--break--><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="348b50cadbd89fc03eb27a9e0f961972.iix" /><br /><br />It's a great data visualisation and emphasises the recursive nature of ITSM, and that there isn't really an end to an implementation (Great news for all of those ITSM consultants eh?)<br /><br />Thinking about the relationships between the core processes - and thinking in terms of workflow rather than high level ITIL volumes, I ended up with a new process flow and a realisation that was new to me.<br /><br /><h3>Maybe Incident Management and Change Management should never meet.</h3><br /><br />The process flow below shows how work moves between different processes - and it shows why generating a Request For Change (or Change Record) directly from an Incident might be a bad idea.<br /><br />Firstly a quick confirmation of the characteristics of each process:<br /><br /><b>Incident Management</b><br /><ul><li>A break in service.</li><li>An outage, failure.</li><li>A degradation in service.</li><li>Aim is to restore service.</li><li>Takes output from Knowledge Management.</li><li>May provide input into the Request Fulfilment process.</li><li>May provide input into the Problem Management process.</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Request Fulfilment</b><br /><ul><li>A service request.</li><li>New Hardware, Software, access or feature.</li><li>Joiners and Leavers.</li><li>Request for Information.</li><li>Feedback.</li><li>Complaint.</li><li>May provide input into the Change Management via a Standard Change.</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Problem Management</b><br /><ul><li>Known Errors and Workarounds.</li><li>Root Cause Analysis.</li><li>Takes input from Incident Management.</li><li>May provide input into the Change Management process via Emergency and Normal Changes.</li><li>Is a part of Knowledge Management by providing known errors.</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Change Management</b><br /><ul><li>Take output from Request Fulfilment via a Standard Change.</li><li>Takes output from Problem Management via a Normal or Emergency Change.</li><li>In advanced implementations can take automated output from Configuration Management.</li></ul><br /><br />So here is my process flow.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="10fcb8c2db5c9344e9737a9e0f961991.iix" /><br /><br />At the top it shows triggers inputting to the Incident Management process - An Event from a monitoring system, an IT engineer or a user via Telephone, Email or Self Service.<br /><br />In the Incident Management process we can determine if we are looking at a Service Request (divert right into the Request Fulfilment process) or an Incident. Is something broken or not?<br /><br />If this is a Service Request we are probably looking at something that is requested fairly routinely. A new DNS record, a new Virtual Server - maybe even a new instance of ServiceNow!<br /><br />This can provide input into the Change Management process as a Standard Change with a pre-defined plan.<br /><br />Let's rewind to the point where we decided the type of incident. If we are looking at something that is broken we can fix it straight away if it is minor.<br /><br />If it is more serious - perhaps we've seen this a few times before, or perhaps we don't understand why this incident happened. We might want to raise a Request For Change to fix it.<br /><br />Here is the realisation I came to - <b><u>You shouldn't raise a Change straight from an Incident.</u></b><br /><br />By doing that you skip past the Problem Management process, and you lose a lot of value. <br /><br />In Problem Management we should be associating one or multiple Incident records to a Problem so that we can document the Known Error - We know that server X exhibits this problem - and hopefully a Workaround.<br /><br />If we skip from Incident directly into Change Management we lose a valuable piece of information which may lead to rework if the same root cause generates more Incidents. <br /><br />Imagine that you are an Server engineer. You get the first instance of a issue that affects users, maybe the server has a hardware fault and needs new memory. If you jump from Incident to Change there isn't a good place for other Incident analysts to check for issues. Another Server engineer might get a second instance of the issue and duplicate your effort.<br /><br />If you don't log the Known Error and a Workaround you might expect other Support analysts to experience the same problem.<br /><br />From the Problem Management process we can then move into Change Management via a Normal or Emergency Change depending on the urgency.<br /><br />The whole point of the diagram I wrote was to explain how Defect management should work - but this blog post is probably long enough!<br /><br />Lastly I realise that this is a very Utopian view, and that organisations might not have a strong Problem Management process - but hopefully the diagram explains how that might help.</p>
