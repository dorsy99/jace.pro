<p>There are some shortcuts in GlideRecord that aren't commonly used, but can save you a few keystrokes if you write a lot of scripts. Here's an example that uses four of them.<br /><br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />var gr = new GlideRecord("incident");<br />gr.addActiveQuery();<br />gr.addNullQuery("assigned_to");<br />gr.addNotNullQuery("assignment_group");<br />gr.addQuery("category", "hardware").addOrCondition("category", "software");<br />gr.query(); <br /></pre><br /><br />The first, gr.addActiveQuery(), is the same as doing gr.addQuery("active", true); There is also an addInactiveQuery() method.<br /><br />The second, gr.addNullQuery("assigned_to"), is the same as doing gr.addQuery("assigned_to", "");<br /><br />The third, gr.addNotNullQuery("assignment_group"), is the same as doing gr.addQuery("assigment_group", "!=", "");<br /><br />The last one is a bit different. One way to include an "OR" condition that you might see in scripts is as follows:<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />var qc1 = gr.addQuery("category", "hardware");<br />qc1.addOrCondition("category", "software");<br /></pre><br /><br />This will include records in either category. The qc1 variable ends up being a QueryCondition object, which is not important to know. QueryCondition has the useful method addOrCondition() that lets you do the OR query.<br /><br />But there's no need for the two lines - you can combine them like in the example above, which actually is more readable (at least to me).</p>
