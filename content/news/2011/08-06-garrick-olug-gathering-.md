<p>Just a quick Save the Date for the next Ohio Local User Group Meeting on Friday, October 14th. It'll be hot off the heels of the ServiceNow October 2011 release and we'll have lots to share. The OCLC has been gracious enough to host and Fruition Partners will be sponsoring lunch and a happy hour. <br /><br />Agenda, and further details to follow, so mark your calendars now and see you soon.<br /><br /><br />Garrick</p>
