<p>Still hungry for content from Knowledge11? Two weeks ago, I posted <a title="mmunity.service-now.com/knowledge11-presentations" href="http://community.service-now.com/knowledge11-presentations">downloadable presentation slides</a> to the community. This week, our folks in Marketing released even more material from Knowledge11--including keynote presentation videos, event photos, a link to the presentations on SlideShare, and the much-beloved intro video that kicked everything off!<br /><br />To view all of this, please visit <a title="w.service-now.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,a56d955c0a0a3cc8016664088dad5818" href="http://www.service-now.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,a56d955c0a0a3cc8016664088dad5818">Knowledge11 - The ServiceNow Global User Conference</a>.<br /><br />As always, feel free to leave your comments below!</p>
