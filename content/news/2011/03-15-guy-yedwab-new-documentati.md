<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />At the New York Local User Group, a discussion among a number of users cropped up about whether you can use Project Management to manage other Planned Tasks, particularly Release.<br /><br />We put out today a document showing how you can manage a Release as a child task of Project:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Managing_Planned_Tasks_in_Project<br /><br />As always, customer experiences and feedback help us a lot in improving documentation, so be sure to use the discussion tab or the comments below to let us know.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Service-now.com Documentation</p>
