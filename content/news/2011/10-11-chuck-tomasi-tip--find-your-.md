<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="741e4802db1417041dcaf3231f9619e8.iix" align="right" />Have you ever found yourself working on a script, business rule, or other record over and over again from a list of dozens or hundreds of entries? If so, then you know how annoying it is to scroll down, or click the "next" arrow a few times. Here's a quick, simple little tip to save you some time on frequently visited files.<br /><!--break--><br />Last week I as helping a customer develop a script include. As you know, there are hundreds of script includes and finding the one you want is only a search away, but why search for it each time? There is an option of <a title="mmunity.service-now.com/blog/ctomasi/labels" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/ctomasi/labels">using Labels</a> that I wrote about, to get easy reference, but here's another alternative for quickly finding your recent work.<br /><br />1. Use the list mechanic icon in the upper left of the list view to personalize the columns you want displayed. Note, this has no effect on the way the list is displayed to other users and you can reset it back to default at any time.<br /><center><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="e2ab2fb9db14df04e9737a9e0f9619ed.iix" /></center><br />2. Locate the "Updated" column on the left and double click it (or use the right facing arrow in the middle) to move it to the "Selected" column on the right.<br /><center><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="6c0ea506dbd8d7041dcaf3231f96198a.iix" /></center><br />3. When you're done, click "OK" and notice that the Updated column has been added to your display. Also, there's a little yellow box on the list mechanic icon letting you know that you are no longer using the default list view.<br /><br />4. Next, right click on the Updated column and select "Sort (z to a)" and your most recent updates will be at the top.<br /><center><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="39beed02dbdcd304b322f4621f96199d.iix" /></center><br /><br />Next time you go to Script Includes, your recent work will also be at the top of the list. Simple, quick, and effective. That's the way I like them.<br /><br />Got a cool ServiceNow idea or tip to share, send me a private message and let's talk!</p>
