<p>Much to our chagrin, behind-the-scenes changes and updates on this Community can trigger unnecessary or duplicate email notifications for groups and subscriptions. <br /><br />First and foremost, I apologize for this happening. I know it's a hassle and we are working to make this Drupal platform more usable and solid. <br /><br />Beyond that, if you have a moment, please reply to random notifications. They go right to my inbox and by pinging me back I can see what's happening. <br /><br />You can also post/vent here.<br /><br />Thanks for your patience,</p>
