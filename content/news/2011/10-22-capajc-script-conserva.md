<p>I'm pretty lazy. So I don't like writing more lines of script that are essential. Case in point, my very first business rule, written maybe five-and-a-half years ago, did about 4 different things but only had one line. (It was a horrible script - I was a Math major and apparently thought I was writing equations instead of scripts.)<br /><br />Sometimes you need to do a GlideRecord query just to get a single record based on a single value, e.g. a user record with a specific name. One might do that like this:<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />doit();<br />function doit() {<br />   var user = new GlideRecord("sys_user");<br />   user.addQuery("name", "Beth Anglin");<br />   user.query();<br />   if (!user.next())&lt;!--break--&gt;<br />      return;<br /><br />   gs.print("Found her: " + gr.name);<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />Many scripters are familiar w/ the get() method of GlideRecord that lets you get a record by its sys_id, avoiding the need for a query() and a next(). e.g.:<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />   var user = new GlideRecord("sys_user");<br />   user.get("ab4738df93ea83fbab4738df93ea83fb");<br />   gs.print("Found her: " + user.name);<br /></pre><br /><br />But get() can also be passed TWO parameters, the first being a field name and the second being a value. So the first script above could be shortened to the following:<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />doit();<br />function doit() {<br />   var user = new GlideRecord("sys_user");<br />   if (!user.get("name", "Beth Anglin"))<br />      return;<br /><br />   gs.print("Found her: " + gr.name);<br />}<br /></pre></p>
