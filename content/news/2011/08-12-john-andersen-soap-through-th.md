<p>Earlier this year, ServiceNow added the ability to send SOAP messages through the MID Server. This was an awesome addition to the product. I played around with the feature just to be familiar with the new feature.<br /><br />I used the wiki documentation on the subject to help me through the process:<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Embedded:Sending_SOAP_Message_via_the_MID_Server<br /><br />I created a step by step tutorial on how to consume the web service through the MID server and get the response:<br />http://www.john-james-andersen.com/blog/service-now/soap-through-a-mid-server.html<br /><br />Many kudos to the ServiceNow development team for this new feature!</p>
