<p>The new knowledge came in fast this week. As a writer, it's always nice to have a queue of topics.<br /><br />This week's topic is overriding a global UI Action. Here's the scenario I got from the client… "I want to change the behavior of the Update button on the change form without impacting everyone else who uses that (since Update is a global UI Action.)" More specifically, he wanted to hide it from the button bar without impacting the other applications. They wanted to use a client script, but started noticing performance issues from using too many client scripts. (They use other UI action form buttons to drive the process.)<br /><br />The solution… make your own UI Action with the same Action Name and it will override the global one.<br /><br />Normally, the Update button has attributes similar to the following:<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />Name: Update<br />Table: global<br />Order: 100<br />Action name: sysverb_update<br />Active: true<br />Form button: true<br /></pre><br />To accomplish the goal of "hiding it" (without using a client script), we created a new UI Action with the following:<br /><br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />Name: Update<br />Table: change_request<br />Order: 100<br />Action name: sysverb_update<br />Active: true<br />Form button: true<br />Condition: current.number.nil()<br /></pre><br />Having the same action_name for the specific change_request table means it will override the default Update button. Since the condition "current.number.nil()" says "display this button if you have nothing in the number field" which will evaluate to false. Exception: if you assign numbers after the record is created, in which case, change the condition to !current.number.nil()<br /><br />Now the condition will always be false, the button won't be displayed, and no client scripts. Nice and fast. Feel free to change the name, condition, etc. to suit your needs. This also works with the other action names, sysverb_insert, sysverb_delete, sysverb_update_and_stay, sysverb_new, etc.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="6ad623b1db181704ed6af3231f9619c2.iix" /></p>
