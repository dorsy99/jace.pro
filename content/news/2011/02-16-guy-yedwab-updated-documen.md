<p>Hi all,<br /><br />We've been hearing feedback about the Release Management v2 documentation, and we've put together two new documents that address some of that feedback.<br /><br />The first is a guide for moving from Release v1 to Release v2:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Moving_from_Release_v1_to_Release_v2<br /><br />The second is a guide for using multiple release plugins side-by-side:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Using_Multiple_Release_Plugins<br /><br />As always, please feel free to use the Discussion tab (if you're logged in) to give us feedback on these new pages. Respond to this thread with your own experiences if you feel like there's more information we could put in.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Documentation</p>
