<p>We're keeping a close eye on the weather for Friday's event. So far, the Columbus forecast looks promising after tomorrow afternoon and please assume we are ON unless posted otherwise. Many of us are coming in from out of town, so of course, please be careful coming in.<br /><br />Thanks and see you Friday!<br /><br />Garrick</p>
