<p>I've seen a couple of requests recently for a capability to record actual, hand-drawn user signatures. There are probably several uses for this type of thing, but usually the requirement has something to do with a field service technician completing work in the field, and then being able to get a customer to sign indicating that some work was performed. This functionality doesn't exist in ServiceNow, but it can be added thanks to a very cool jQuery plugin called '<a title="omasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-pad" href="http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-pad" target="_blank">Signature Pad</a>'. I've incorporated this jQuery solution into a UI page/Dialog-based solution for use with regular ServiceNow records and forms.
