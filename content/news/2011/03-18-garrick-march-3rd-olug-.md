<p>Hello Fellow Ohio LUGers,<br /><br />Before everyone gets too caught up in March Madness, wanted to drop off the slide decks from the March 3rd event at the OCLC. I'll be putting up a more encompassing recap at a later date, but have had several requests for the slides so wanted to post these first. (We'll also be announcing the winner of the Amazon gift card...stay tuned!)<br /><br />Again a big thank you to our sponsors and all those who presented during the day.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Garrick</p>
