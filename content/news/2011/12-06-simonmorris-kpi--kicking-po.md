<p>Poor ITILGirl...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><img src="http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/1396006705/itilgirl_normal.png" /></td><td><a title="itter.com/#!/ITILgirl/status/143640704814559232" href="http://twitter.com/#!/ITILgirl/status/143640704814559232">Take ownership of colleague's old incidents, get blamed in stats for not resolving them on time. AWESOME.</a></td></tr></table><br /><br />Hmph, an exercise in unfairness... of course if her manager managed to interpret meaning behind the statistics in front of him - rather than just reading the numbers he'd come to a different conclusion.<br /><br />Wikipedia describes <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">statistics</a> as "the study of the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data". If one were to actually study, analyse or interpret the data the manager would see that the duration of time that ITILgirl had the incident assigned to her has some meaning.<br /><br />And anyway - KPIs are performance indicators of the health of the process - not individual engineer performance reviews (thanks @riChchestMat)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><img src="http://a2.twimg.com/profile_images/1654367342/image_normal.jpg" /></td><td><a title="itter.com/#!/riChchestMat/status/143641749313691648" href="http://twitter.com/#!/riChchestMat/status/143641749313691648">.@ITILgirl Metrics should be used to identify improvements - not blame individuals. sigh.</a></td></tr></table><br /><br />Goes to show how important data visualisation is. Perhaps rather than an (long overdue) duration of the Incident with ITILgirls name against it a better way of representing duration is required. The brain isn't great at mentally calculating and comparing multiple time durations from raw data.<br /><br />ServiceNow developer John Roberts (<a title="itter.com/j_roberts" href="http://twitter.com/j_roberts">@j_roberts</a>) tackled this a while ago....<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="3396208adbd0dfc068c1fb651f9619d5.iix" /><br /><br />...hopefully something we'll see in the product soon.</p>
