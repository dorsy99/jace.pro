<p>A large percentage of ServiceNow customers will import users from an LDAP source. Typically these sources are Active Directory based, but often times we run into customers using Novell eDirectory. For the most part, the examples on the wiki are sufficient, but I found the eDirectory is a bit different from Active Directory, so I thought I would create a step-by-step example of importing users from a Novell eDirectory tree, mapping that data, and then performing an integrated LDAP login with the users.
