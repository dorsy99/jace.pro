<p>Lately I've been doing some service catalog work for a couple of clients and I've come across a requirement that I really haven't had to address before. The requirement deals with order guidesâ€¦specifically with the ability to control the execution order of individual items within an order guide. You're probably aware that ServiceNow provides complete control over the ordering of tasks within a catalog item, but what do you do with an order guide that needs to have one item complete before the next 2 items can start? There's not a simple way to control this behavior by default so I came up with a way and I've shared it at SNGuru.
