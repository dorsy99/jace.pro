If so then you'll need to learn how to do some scripting. The prerequisites for this class are basic familiarity with the Service-now platform (System Administrator) and knowledge of the fundamentals of JavaScript.<br/><br/>This class begins at a very basic level and builds from there including client scripting (using GlideForm) and server scripting (using GlideRecord and Business Rules). There are hands-on labs so that you'll create and run scripts yourself and also have an opportunity to practice doing some troubleshooting on scripts.<br/><br/><strong>Full description:</strong> <br/><br/><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.service-now.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,48ebf431ff620000ebc5faa6497efe32" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.service-now.com/knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,48ebf431ff620000ebc5faa6497efe32</a><br/><br/></p><hr width="60%"/><br/><br/><span>For all your ServiceNow training needs, please visit: </span><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.service-now.com/training.do" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.service-now.com/training.do</a><br/><br/><span>Have you ever attended a ServiceNow training?
