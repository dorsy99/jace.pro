<p>So perhaps it's time for another post from the <a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://community.service-now.com/blog/seanpmcclean/woman-goose-and-parking-lot-itil-real-world" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"duck-duck-goose guy"</a>. One of the things I've been hearing a lot of recently is confusion about the ITIL V3 life-cycle. 5 pieces: <strong>Strategy, Design, Transition, Operations, Continual Service Improvement</strong>. How do they fit together and work?</p><p></p><p>We know when we have questions, issues, requests for more, we call the <strong>Service Desk</strong> about it. We know that when it's "broke" we log an <strong>Incident</strong>. When it "breaks a lot" we may open a <strong>Problem</strong> to look for a single, underlying <strong>Root Cause</strong>. All of these things we see in our "Day to day <strong>Operations</strong>"</p><p></p><p>Great — so we're pretty familiar w. just 1 piece of the 5 piece life-cycle…<strong>Operations</strong>. But what about the others? Conceptually, where do they fit in?</p><p></p><p>For the "visual" people reading this (er, assuming anyone is reading this) I've posted a diagram:</p><p></p><p><a _jive_internal="true" href="/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-1380-3259/blogpost_itlifecycle_image1b.jpg"><img   alt="" class="jive-image" height="506" src="006aec0edb909344e9737a9e0f9619ad.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="551"/></a></p><p></p><p>Looking at the diagram, I have business drivers and IT technology improvements driving <strong>Strategic</strong> decisions about <strong>Designed</strong> IT services that are <strong>Transitioned</strong> into <strong>Operations</strong>, being driven by the need to <strong>Continually Improve</strong> those IT services (whew).</p><p></p><p>But what about all of this? How would I see it in real life?</p><p></p><p>Well to do that, I'd have look far, far into the past. To a time where Jet was going to be the new AC/DC, Arnold Schwarzenegger became Governer, Homeland Security had just been created and well, lot's of things were weird.</p><p></p><p>Yes, I'm talking about 2003 / 2004.</p><p></p><p>In my next post, I'll take this real-world example of an IT Service that most of us use, and I'll walk it through the <strong>Strategy, Design, Transition</strong> portions of the life-cycle. We'll brush across <strong>Operations</strong> and jump right into <strong>Continual Service Improvement</strong>, so we can see how that IT Service has since driven still more NEW IT services that are being born.</p><p></p><p>And if you just can't wait, I'll give you one more hint. It begins with a very long line…</p>
