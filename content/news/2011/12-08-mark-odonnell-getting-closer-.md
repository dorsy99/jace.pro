<p>Best practice comes with experience and learning from both success and failures. This page in the WIKI is my attempt to summarize what you should expect when going into a CMS project, and is the first installment in a 4 part CMS best practices page that will span Planning, Preparation, Deployment, and end with Maintenance.<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Content_Management_Best_Practices<br /><br /><br />Please take a look and keep your eyes on this pages as I will be adding to it whenever I get a chance.</p>
