<p>Our Winter11 release is almost here. With this release Service-now.com brings customers into the age of IT 3.0 through the introduction of social IT functionality, multiple configuration management updates, and a new application to manage IT governance, risk and compliance.<br /><br />I've attached a PDF from our marketing team that describes each aspect of the release. The Winter11 release will be updated to all instances on the evening of February 4. We expect to have documentation ready a few days prior. If you have any questions, feel free to post as a comment to this post.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Wally Marx<br />Mgr, Technical Publications</p>
