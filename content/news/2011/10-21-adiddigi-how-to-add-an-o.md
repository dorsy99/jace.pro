<p>We had a requirement from a client asking us to populate all the options on the Service Request Form dynamically from a table.So we wrote our own UI page which will get all the options from a table.<br />One of the problems in writing our own UI pages with all the "fields" we want is we have to attach their event handlers and handle each and every validation :(<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In the process of validating them, we had a statement,<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />var element1 = document.createElement('input');<br />element1.type = 'checkbox';<br />element1.id = 'checkbox' + i;<br />element1.setAttribute('onclick','handlerfunction(this)');<br /></pre><br /><br />It was working fine with Firefox, But when i tested it with IE, it wasn't working :(. One more reason for me to hate IE :|<br /><br /><br />Reason : setAttribute doesn't work in IE.<br /><br />I explored all the links that google gave me with little success.Finally, I thought of using the "observe" method of prototype.<br /><br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/PROTOTYPE.png" /><br /><br />http://www.prototypejs.org/api/event/observe <br /><br />You can find everything about events in the above link. Also one of the reasons I like about prototype when it comes to event handling is, You need not pass 'this' again to a handler function. <br />the code is as simple as this<br /><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_code"><br /><br />Event.observe(element1.id,'click',check); //Explanation is there in the link given above<br /></pre><br />and yippee it started working in IE :)</p>
