<p>All,<br /><br />Based on a number of calls this morning, we're going to cancel tomorrow's Ohio User Group meeting scheduled at OCLC in Dublin due to the weather. The snow is one thing, but the greater concern is for safety given the sub zero wind chills in the forecast for tomorrow.<br /><br />Our plan to is to post a reschedule date for late February once we solidify those details. Stay warm!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Terry Brown<br />ServiceNow</p>
