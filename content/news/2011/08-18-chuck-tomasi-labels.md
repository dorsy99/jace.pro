<p>One of my favorite time saving features of ServiceNow is labels. This handy, and often overlooked feature, can speed up the navigation to a specific record.<br /><br />As I develop solutions, I find I'm constantly going to the same business rule, script include, UI action, or whatever, multiple times a day - usually in rapid succession. I also have a favorite incident, change, CI or other test record that I frequent to test out my development efforts. Using labels, I can easily group these things together and access them quickly from the top of the navigation menu on the left.<br /><br />Adding a label to a record is pretty straight forward. You can do it from the list menu or from an open record by right clicking and assigning an existing label or creating a new one. For full information about adding, managing, and even notifications, see <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Creating_and_Using_Labels" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Creating_and_Using_Labels">Labels</a> in the wiki.<br /><center><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="4f1fc8cedb9c1344e9737a9e0f961907.iix" /><br /></center><br />Let's say I'm working on a UI Action, that calls code from one of my script includes, and I'm testing it on CHG0030050. I go to the UI Action, right click on the header and select Assign Label&gt; New..., give it some meaningful name (e.g. Cancel Change Button). The UI Action is added to the left navbar under a new group labeled "Cancel Change Button". Next, I go to the script include, right click on the record header and select Assign Label&gt; Cancel Change Button. This places another link in that same group. Finally, I open CHG0030050 and do the same thing. Now I can jump between the UI Action, the Script Include and test record without having to use the navbar filter, or drill through long lists of records.<br /><center><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="4579abf9db54dfc0b322f4621f961980.iix" /><br /></center><br /><br />In a few days when you're done with development on the cancel change button, click the "Cancel Change Button" label in the navbar and delete it (or modify the label entries in the related list as appropriate.)<br /><br />Sure, you can do this by clicking and dragging to <a title="ki.service-now.com/index.php?title=UI11" href="http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=UI11">UI11</a>'s bookmarks bar. I have two responses... first, not everyone is using UI11. Second, if you're like me, your UI11 bookmarks bar is getting pretty full of modules and custom lists. Adding a bunch of scripts and test records makes it a bit too cluttered. Why not offload the single record entries in to one or more label groups?</p>
