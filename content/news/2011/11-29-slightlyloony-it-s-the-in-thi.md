But surely there's an easier, more elegant way to do this — that would be the "in thing" if it existed, just like my hat!<br /><br />Why, yes it would, my dear...<br /><!--break--><br />Here's some code that sets up the issue:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;color:FireBrick;"><br />var xerces = {a:45, b:12, c:undefined, d:null};<br />gs.log(xerces.c);<br />gs.log(xerces.e);<br /></pre><br />When we run that code, both log outputs will show "undefined", even though one of the properties (<span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">c</span>) actually exists. In the previous post I noted that you could do something like this:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;color:FireBrick;"><br />var xerces = {a:45, b:12, c:undefined, d:null};<br />gs.log(xerces.c + ', but exists: ' + xerces.hasOwnProperty('c'));<br />gs.log(xerces.e + ', but exists: ' + xerces.hasOwnProperty('e'));<br /></pre><br />This is the awkward, ugly syntax my young friend is complaining about. Here's a different way:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;color:FireBrick;"><br />var xerces = {a:45, b:12, c:undefined, d:null};<br />gs.log(xerces.c + ', but exists: ' + ('c' in xerces));<br />gs.log(xerces.e + ', but exists: ' + ('e' in xerces));<br /></pre><br />It's the "in" thing! Well, the "in" <i>operator</i>, actually.<br /><br />But it gets better. The <span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">in</span> property is also useful for check for properties that aren't enumerable. Consider this code:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;color:FireBrick;"><br />var harry = [4,87,23,982,2];<br />for (var name in harry)<br />    gs.log(name);<br /></pre><br />If you run this code, you'll see that it enumerates properties named "0" through "4" — the elements of the of the array. But you know that the array has other properties, such as its methods. For example, the Array class has a <span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">join()</span> method. This method (like many built-in methods and properties) is not <i>enumerable</i>, so it never gets picked up by the <span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">for ()</span> loop. But the <span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">in</span> operator can see it quite nicely (while the <span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">hasOwnProperty()</span> method does not):<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;color:FireBrick;"><br />var harry = [4,87,23,982,2];<br />gs.log(harry.join(' - '));<br />gs.log(harry.hasOwnProperty('join'));<br />gs.log('join' in harry);<br /></pre><br />Run that code, and you'll see this:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;color:FireBrick;"><br />4 - 87 - 23 - 982 - 2<br />false<br />true<br /></pre><br />The first line proves that the <span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">hasOwnProperty()</span> method is actually there (and it works!). The second line shows that the <span style="font-family=Courier;color:FireBrick;">hasOwnProperty()</span> method does not detect it. Finally, the last line shows that the <i>in thing</i> picked it up just fine...</p>
