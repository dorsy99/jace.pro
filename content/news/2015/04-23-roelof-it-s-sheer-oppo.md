<p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">On April 20<sup>th</sup>, prior to the start of Knowledge15 (#Know15) in Las Vegas, we hosted the annual Global PartnerNow Summit. More than 700 representatives of our partner ecosystem had accepted the invitation and were in for a real treat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"><br/></span></p><p><img   alt="K15-PartnerSummit.jpeg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="356" src="8cad5002db1057041dcaf3231f961915.iix" style="height: 356px; width: 475.51428571428573px; float: left;" width="476"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"><strong>Our ecosystem grows and evolves</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">For me, it's fascinating to experience the tremendous growth and development of the ServiceNow partner landscape. Every year, we add new partners and new <em>types</em> of partners to our world. From partners that help ServiceNow clients implementing their selected service management solutions to the ones that provide strategic advice at board level on how employees can change the way they work. But also partners that build applications using the ServiceNow platform, partners that provide technology solutions that integrate with the ServiceNow platform and managed services partners attended this summit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"><strong><br/></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"><strong>It's all about opportunity </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">If you wonder why would all these different partners fly in from across the globe to sit in a Las Vegas conference room for a full day of updates? I think the answer is quite simple, really. To learn about the growing number of opportunities the ServiceNow community has to offer. Not only because the number of ServiceNow Global 2,000 clients and beyond is growing at a rapid pace but also because of the increasing footprint of ServiceNow solutions, above and beyond IT. Not surprisingly the theme of the PartnerNow summit was 'Accelerating Growth with Everything as a Service'.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"><strong>New announcements for partners </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">The summit started off with ServiceNow updates and announcements about new and upcoming tools to enable the partners benefitting from the various market opportunities. Besides the launch of the external <a title="w.servicenow.com/partners/find-a-partner.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/partners/find-a-partner.html">partner finder</a>, the extended training and certification possibilities for partners and the services specialization, the <a title="w.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-launches-store.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-launches-store.html">launch</a> of the<a title="tore.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/home" href="https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/home"> ServiceNow Store</a> probably created the most interest and request for more information. The ServiceNow Store enables our partners to promote their created enterprise applications using the ServiceNow platform. This will open up new markets and create new business opportunity for certified Technology Partners. Check <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=05cc2265dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961915">this post</a> for more ServiceNow Store details and Q&amp;A.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"><strong>Technology Partner Program </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">During the day I talked to various partners and it's clear that each and everyone of them sees the vast opportunity out there. Now, it's time for action. ServiceNow Store opened shop with dozens of applications on the shelve. Now, partners who want to be part of this exciting new opportunity, need to take action. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">We expect the launch of ServiceNow Store to increase the call for developer content. The Technology Partner Program (TPP) was designed to meet this new demand for development tools and partner enablement. For more information on TPP, <a title="pp.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/tpp/program" href="https://tpp.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/tpp/program">click here</a>.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">When we are all back next week, let's make sure we start to benefit from all the new tools, programs and product releases to really grasp this enormous opportunity.</span></p>
