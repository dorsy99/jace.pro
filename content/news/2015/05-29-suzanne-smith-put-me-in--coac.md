<p>Do you need a way to mentor others and offer feedback after an action is completed in a task-based process like incident, problem, or change management? If you do, take a look at the <a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Coaching_Loops#gsc.tab=0" title="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Coaching_Loops#gsc.tab=0">Coaching Loops</a> application. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">This useful app enables mentors ("coaches") to help guide individual users or groups ("coachees") through their work and provide tips to improve performance. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">The following terms are important in Coaching Loops:</span></p><ul><li><strong>Coaching discipline:</strong> process that can be coached</li><li><strong>Coaching opportunity:</strong> specific points in the process that can be coached</li><li><strong>Coaching assessment:</strong> coachee work review and feedback</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">For example, let's say the coaching discipline is incident management. Coaching opportunities in incident management could include updating an incident, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/incident/blog/2015/05/21/managing-incident-priority-settings">changing incident priority</a>, and <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/incident/blog/2015/03/05/close-those-incidents">closing an incident</a>. The coaching discipline and the coaching opportunity must both exist on the same table - in this case they are both on the Incident table. When a user takes an action such as changing incident priority, an assessment record is automatically created for the user and assigned to the coach. The coach and coachee can then review the coachee task performance and enter work notes.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Creating a coaching discipline:</span></p><p>First, establish the process for which you want to coach users.</p><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>Coaching Loops &gt; Coaching Disciplines</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>New</strong>.</li><li>Fill in the following fields: <strong>Short description</strong>, <strong>Discipline</strong>, <strong>Coachee Group</strong>, and <strong>Coaching Group</strong>.
