<p>When I started at ServiceNow almost three years ago one of the first things I did was to talk to our developers on how they are using our platform.   One of the developers I met <img  alt="sreedhar.jpeg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="d4e2e906db1cd304b322f4621f9619c9.iix" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em; height: auto; float: right;"/><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">early on </span><a title="Sreedhar Matt" __default_attr="2596" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro_user jive_macro" data-objecttype="3" data-orig-content="Sreedhar Matt" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=1713d665db1c1fc09c9ffb651f961950" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Sreedhar Matt</a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">   showed me multiple apps he and his team had built - apps that replaced legacy systems they had (giving them not only modern functionality but also saving money on </span>maintenance<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> cost) and apps for new areas of their business. They have continued on this journey of building custom apps on the ServiceNow platform. Sreedhar is a wealth of knowledge on how to best use the platform - everything from what the right fit applications are to technical best practices.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> I caught up with Sreedhar recently and asked him a few questions about </span><a title="Knowledge 15" __default_attr="2050" __jive_macro_name="community" class="jive_macro_community jive_macro" data-objecttype="14" data-orig-content="Knowledge 15" href="undefined2050" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Knowledge 15</a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> and </span><a title="CreatorCon" __default_attr="2074" __jive_macro_name="community" class="jive_macro_community jive_macro" data-objecttype="14" data-orig-content="CreatorCon" href="undefined2074" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">CreatorCon</a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">.   He is a Knowledge veteran and this year in addition to presenting at Knowledge he is planning to attend as many of the sessions at CreatorCon as possible - his shortlist includes reporting, under the hood and Store sessions. And ofcourse the parties!   His advice for first time attendees was to identify sessions that they can learn from and immediately apply the learning at work when they go back.   His other piece of advice was to network with other attendees. And that is one of the biggest value you get from attending Knowledge and CreatorCon, the learning that comes from interacting with other attendees like Sreedhar.     If you have attended any of the previous Knowledge events or even a @SNUG in your city, you know how welcoming and open the ServiceNow community is - I urge you take advantage of your presence at Knowledge and CreatorCon to network and learn from other experts.   Checkout the <a __default_attr="2146" __jive_macro_name="community" class="jive_macro_community jive_macro" data-orig-content="Network" href="undefined2146" modifiedtitle="true" title="Network">Network</a> section of the Knowledge site on how you can begin your networking even before you get there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p>
