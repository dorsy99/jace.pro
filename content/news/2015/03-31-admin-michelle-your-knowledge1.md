With UI15's fast-loading wireframe icons and colorful themes, the ServiceNow UI continues to be elegantly refined. The Fuji Release offers a full plate of new features and functions too, and Knowledge15 Pre-Conference Training is THE place to learn about these!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">ServiceNow Education Services has cooked up three courses that will be available for the first time at Knowledge15 Pre-Conference Training. You can savor the information presented in Reporting and Performance Analytics, ServiceWatch, and Project and Portfolio Management (PPM). This is the first time that these courses are being taught at Knowledge15 Pre-Conference Training, and all include Fuji functionality.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">And <strong>all</strong> of our courses have been spiced with new Fuji functionality! For example, in Advanced System Administration, User Criteria is included along with a robust lab to further your understanding. Our Education Services catalog of 12 courses offers focused courseware on applications like Asset Management, Orchestration, and Discovery, as well as classes that increase your ServiceNow administrator skills. You will be well prepared for the rest of Knowledge15. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Your Knowledge15 Pre-Conference Training</strong> <strong>Preparation Tasks</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">--&gt; Come to the table, that is, the classroom, with the following:</span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Laptop system — Tablets are lighter, smaller, and have less calories, but to access all of the functionality available to being a user with the admin role, use a laptop. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Choice of browsers - One of the exciting aspects of the Fuji Release is UI15. <span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Being able to access more than one browser can be advantageous, during both Pre-Conference and Knowledge15 sessions. For example, p</span><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">arts of the PPM application will not render if the browser does not support UI14/UI15, so having another browser on your system is handy.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Extra power cords — Please put your name and contact number on all accessories. </span></li></ul><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;"><span>--&gt; Confirm your access to </span><a title="k-external-small" class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://trainingdept.service-now.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://trainingdept.service-now.com</a><span>, the Training Department's perpetual instance. <br/></span></span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">If you know your username and password, validate your login. Your username is usually your email address.</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">If you forgot and need to retrieve your password, use the <strong>reset your password here</strong> link.</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif;">If this is your first time visiting the instance, you can create a new account by clicking the <strong>self registration form</strong> link.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Education Services Staff is Ready to Serve</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Each classroom is staffed with ServiceNow professionals ready to cater to your needs and answer your questions. Want more information on a feature? Chances are that one of the Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be presenting during the Knowledge15 Conference on that very feature. Do not hesitate to ask questions and network with classmates, Instructors, and TAs.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>For a Full Course of ServiceNow Knowledge, see the Top 5 Recommendations</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Every ServiceNow Curriculum Developer has carefully curated a list of labs and breakouts that support and further what you have learned.
