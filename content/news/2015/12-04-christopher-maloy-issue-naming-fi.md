<p><span style="color: #343d47; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">This may already be a known issue in the community, but this week was the first time I encountered the problem.   You will notice when creating a table within a scoped application, as you create fields the field names in the dictionary <strong>do not</strong> begin with u_ .   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #343d47; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">This is great, but this week I encountered a customer naming a True/False field type a value that started with a number.   They were seeing <span style="color: #343d47; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR</strong></span> <span style="color: #343d47; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">as an error upon commit.   I am not sure what other field types may have this problem, but maybe as best practice don't name any columns starting with numerics.   There can be several weird form rendering side effects with formatters and other things.   </span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #343d47; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Remember you can use a label for a column field, if you want, that is different than the field name (labels can include or start with numerics).</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #343d47; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Avoid starting field names with numerics.   </span></p>
