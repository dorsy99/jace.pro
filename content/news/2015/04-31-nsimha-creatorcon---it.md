This is true of most disruptive technologies and certainly about out platform which enables a wide spectrum of developers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Workshops and Breakouts</strong> - Great technical content - most of it at intermediate and advanced level.   <em>We have made all the content available <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=0e2ee66ddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961993">here</a></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>.</em></span>   In the coming days, we will record the most popular ones and share it with the community.</p><p></p><p><strong>HackZone</strong> - It was fun to watch developers control disco lights with ServiceNow.   Also, interesting was the ideas it triggered - one developer wanted to integrate a card reader into his facility management app, another wanted to integrate SmartThings in a data center to pinpoint the rack where the failed CI is located.</p><p></p><p><strong>Certified Application Developer</strong> - we introduced a brand new certification.   <a title="Robert Beeman" __default_attr="26602" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro_user jive_macro" data-orig-content="Robert Beeman" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=5c70d2a9db581fc09c9ffb651f961988">Robert Beeman</a> if officially the first certified developer.   Congrats Robert!</p><p></p><p><strong>Meet the experts at Developer Lounge</strong> and the booths we had for the developer program, community and store.   Lot of great conversation and ideas.   Please keep the conversation and questions going in this community.</p><p></p><p><strong>Party at House of Blues</strong> - what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas :-)</p>
