<p>If you are using Internet Explorer, you may find that your UI14 interface is not working in Eureka. The reason for this could be that the Internet Explorer developer mode is set incorrectly or the Compatibility View is on.</p><p></p><p>What does this mean? If a local machine has a policy that defines ServiceNow as an intranet site, IE displays these sites in Compatibility Mode by default, which disables UI14. Another reason could be that the document mode and user-agent string in the IE F12 Developer Tools, which are designed for building and debugging your web page, are set incorrectly. The Developer Tools are set to 7 by default on IE 9, 10, and 11 when the ServiceNow website is treated like an intranet site. If set less than 9, this causes the UI to fail when accessing the Eureka instance.</p><p></p><p>To correct this, we recommended that you upgrade to an newer version of Internet Explorer to avoid performance issues. If that's not an option, you can also disable the Compatibility View on your instance or IE, or reset the Developer Tools.</p><p></p><h2>How to disable Compatibility View on your instance:</h2><p><br/>Setting the Â  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">glide.ui.allow_ie_compatibility_mode</span> property to <strong>false </strong>overrides the browser's compatibility settings and forces the application out of Compatibility View. This allows UI14 to run on Internet Explorer on versions prior to IE9 without breaking the interface. To disable:</p><ol><li>In the navigation filter, enter <strong>sys_properties.list</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>glide.ui.allow_ie_compatibility_mode</strong>.</li><li>Set the value to <strong>False</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Update</strong>.</li></ol><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="compatiblity view false.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="d995218edb50d7049c9ffb651f9619bf.iix" style="height: 329px; width: 620px; border: #BDBDBD 4px solid; border-radius: 15px;"/></p><p></p><h2>How to disable Compatibility View in IE:</h2><ol><li>From the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, open the <strong>Compatibility View </strong>settings.</li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Display intranet sites</strong>.</li></ol><p></p><h2>How to set F12 Developer Tools in IE:</h2><ol><li>Log in to your instance.</li><li>Open <strong>F12 Developer Tools</strong> in Internet Explorer (you can click <strong>F12</strong> or go to the tools icon and select <strong>F12 tools</strong>).</li><li>Go to <strong>Emulation</strong>.</li><li>Change the document mode to <strong>9</strong> and user-agent string to <strong>Internet Explorer 9</strong>.</li><li>Log out and back in.</li></ol><p></p><p>We strongly advise that you upgrade to a new version of IE to prevent performance issues.
