<p>How well does your HR organization deliver its employee services?   Are IT service management trends making the way to HR? During our recent #StateofWork chat, we discussed the next wave of service transformation with these top experts:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><a title="witter.com/billkutik" href="https://twitter.com/billkutik">Bill Kutik</a><span style="color: #1f2326;">, tech columnist for </span><a title="w.hreonline.com/HRE/" href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/">Human Resources Executive</a><span style="color: black;">, host and managing editor of <em>Firing Line with Bill Kutik</em></span></li><li><a title="witter.com/schoolcw" href="https://twitter.com/schoolcw">Claire Schooley,</a> principle analyst, Forrester Research</li><li><a title="witter.com/stroud_jen" href="https://twitter.com/stroud_jen">Jen Stroud</a><span style="color: black;">, senior director and general manager, HR Applications, ServiceNow</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="color: #1f1e1e;"><strong>Service Management in HR?</strong></span></p><p></p><p>The conversation began with the observation that IT self-service has significantly improved the way IT delivers services to employees.   Morale is higher for employees who can quickly get questions answered, solve problems and move onto their work.   Could HR follow suit and evolve the way it engages with employees?</p><p></p><p>Recent research indicates so. HR is the number one group outside IT currently implementing service management.</p><p><img   alt="Departments outside IT.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="daa48846db1c5fc068c1fb651f9619fc.iix" style="height: 300px; width: 620px;"/></p><p>Organizations like <a title="w.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/university-of-bradford-transforms-hr-operations-with-servicenow.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/university-of-bradford-transforms-hr-operations-with-servicenow.html">The University of Bradford</a> are taking advantage of the benefits that service management has to offer. The higher education institution in the UK is rolling out service management capabilities to help HR improve efficiency and responsiveness for more than 3,000 employees.</p><p>Bradford is not alone.</p><p></p><p>Said Jen Stroud of the trend:</p><p><img   alt="Untitled.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="ec606f79db185b048c8ef4621f96197a.iix" style="height: 155px; width: 620px;"/></p><p>Resident HR expert from Forrester Research, Claire Schooley, suggests that HR process automation can result in a focus on higher value programs like recruiting, talent management, and professional development:</p><p><img   alt="Clarir Schooley 2.png" class="jive-image image-2" src="35b70c8edbd8db048c8ef4621f96196c.iix" style="height: 67px; width: 620px;"/></p><p>This puts HR in the driver's seat to help create better employee experiences.</p><p></p><p><strong>HR and IT Working Together</strong></p><p>Next, the crowd discussed how IT could play a major role in empowering HR to become more efficient and effective.   Participants agreed that IT should work to better understand HR's business needs.</p><p><img   alt="Clarie Schooley 3.png" class="jive-image image-3" src="d905e3f9dbdc9f04e9737a9e0f961917.iix" style="height: 107px; width: 620px;"/></p><p><img   alt="Jen S 3.png" class="jive-image image-4" src="c5b8c106db9497049c9ffb651f961942.iix" style="height: 74px; width: 620px;"/></p><p>Chat participants noted that most ServiceNow customers already have a system of record for human capital management (HCM)—such as Workday or Oracle.   Just as IT provides a system of engagement to help employees access its services easily, HR can follow suit.</p><p></p><p>HR can use ServiceNow, for example, as a system of engagement that integrates with their existing HCM solution. Having a system of engagement gives the HR function a standard way for employees to engage with the department. If IT and HR teams can work together, they can transform their employee experience.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Problem with Email</strong></p><p></p><p>The chat suggested that when HR relies upon email for managing its request and fulfilling processes, managers experience lack of consistency and control.   HR leaders can't see what work their teams are doing. Prioritizing cases also becomes difficult.   The processes can be complex.</p><p></p><p>Noted Stroud, employees want to know that their problem has been acknowledged, is being worked on, and when it will be resolved:</p><p><img   alt="Jen S 4.png" class="jive-image image-5" src="57f6600adb1857041dcaf3231f961937.iix" style="height: 70px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p>While email has its place in professional communication, organizations should move away from email and spreadsheets for tracking, managing, and reporting on service-based requests.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Portal: Creating Consumer-Like Experiences in the Enterprise </strong></p><p>One thing was clear among participants: The tip of the iceberg to alleviating administrative work in HR is the self-service portal. When linked to HCM systems of record, portals provide the kind of consumer-like experiences that employees are coming to expect at work, with the potential to drive greater levels of engagement.</p><p><img   alt="Bill K 1.png" class="jive-image image-6" src="4485c40adb581304b322f4621f961913.iix" style="height: 70px; width: 620px;"/></p><p><img   alt="John Mc 1.png" class="jive-image image-7" src="b136ebb9db541fc068c1fb651f961905.iix" style="height: 71px; width: 620px;"/></p><p>The group agreed, relying on email or paper is outdated.   HR leaders are starting to realize that they need to evolve the processes that support employee engagement with HR services.</p><p></p><p style="margin-right: -22.5pt;">Where is your company's HR system of engagement on the spectrum, and how could IT help it improve?   Are HR + IT like "peanut butter and jelly" or "oil and water"?   What suggestions do you have on how they can work well together for this common cause?</p><p style="margin-right: -22.5pt;"></p><p>Visit <a title="ww.crowdchat.net/stateofwork" href="https://www.crowdchat.net/stateofwork">https://www.crowdchat.net/stateofwork</a> to see the full chat transcript.</p>
