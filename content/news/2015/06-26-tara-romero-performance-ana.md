Let's get to know our mysterious cousin Performance Analytics, shall we? Performance Analytics is ServiceNow's in platform analytics product. Highly desired by upper level management and higher-ups, PA is a great way to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/performance-analytics/blog/2014/01/09/performance-analytics">drive and visualize performance </a>and implement business intelligence within the ServiceNow system to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=765c2aa1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96193b">help your organization make critical decisions.</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><img   alt="performance analytics servicenow.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="99807771db9c93049c9ffb651f961939.iix" style="height: 300px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We decided to kick the tires in and take PA for a ride here at ServiceNow and it has been quite a ride.   What we discovered is that there is so so much that you can do...wrong.   Perhaps wrong is not the right word, maybe the right way to phrase is <em>there is so much you can do easily and quickly that can rapidly create a messy environment</em>.   In other words, it can quickly become quite the handful if not properly managed.   </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">At first, we had several <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Performance_Analytics#Roles" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Performance_Analytics#Roles">Performance Analytics admins.</a> That means we had several people creating indicators, sources, widgets, etc. and very little processes or procedures (it was a creative person's dream</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">!) loose processes and procedures also meant: loose structure, little accountability, and a multi-pronged vision. We had to wake up and smell the coffee, things could not continue in this direction.   We wanted the company to embrace the product and really use it to drive the business.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In the oncoming weeks I will cover how ServiceNow implemented a program to get the most out of Performance Analytics. I will show you.. </span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>HOW </strong></span>having an organized process for implementing Performance Analytics will benefit YOU</li><li><strong>WHAT </strong>you can do as an organization to properly manage and maintain Performance Analytics</li><li><strong>WHY </strong>this organized paradigm is good for your company!</li></ul><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"><em><br/></em></p><p></p><p>I will start with how we cleaned up our current process. Then I will show you how we structured our development environment to reflect our new <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=996eaeaddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619d3">PA values</a>, followed by a tour of how we are going to manage, monitor and control the implementation. Finally, I will walk you through structuring your users in a way that will keep your system clean and up to your new standards with hierarchy and on-boarding.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>3 ways we are Cleaning up our Performance Analytics environment:</h1><p><span style="color: #333333;">We are establishing a structure for formatting and managing all sources, indicators, breakdowns and widgets proved instrumental in maintaining a healthy environment.</span></p><p></p><table border="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="20%"><strong>Remove duplicate entries</strong></td><td valign="top" width="80%">Not everyone goes about doing the same thing, the same way.   Delete extraneous and duplicate entries. This might require going through each item to review and delete but it is well worth the effort.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="20%"><strong>Apply naming conventions</strong></td><td valign="top" width="80%">Get organized. Is there a grouping that makes sense to admins and power users that will enable them to find what they need right away?   Take a moment and standardize how each source, indicator, breakdown and widget should be named. (see examples below)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="20%"><strong>Consolidate</strong></td><td valign="top" width="80%">Review all existing sources, indicators, breakdowns and widgets.   Are there more than one that are doing essentially the same thing? Get rid of them, fine tune your sources so that you have a single source for many indicators - the indicators should have unique customization and the sources should remain as high level as possible.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Here are two examples of naming convention suggestions you could implement at your own organization:</p><p></p><h4>Example: Analytic/Requirement -<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> New Incidents (Customer Only) for Customer Support Dashboard</span></h4><p><strong>Source:</strong> Incidents.New</p><p>(References the Table.Attribute)</p><p><strong>Indicator:</strong> INT: New - Customer Only</p><p>(References the primary object being reported on and description, PRIMARYOBJECT: Description)</p><p><strong>Widget:</strong> CSD: New Incident Activity - Customers Only</p><p>(References the dashboard it's located on and description, DASHBOARD: Description)</p><p></p><h4>Example: Analytic/Requirement - <span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 1.5em;">Closed Changes (Internal Only) for Admin Dashboard</span></h4><p><strong>Source:</strong> Changes.Closed</p><p>(References the Table.Attribute)</p><p><strong>Indicator:</strong> CHG: Closed - Internal Only</p><p>(References the primary object being reported on and description, PRIMARYOBJECT: Description)</p><p><strong>Widget:</strong> AD: Change Activity - Internal Only</p><p>(References the dashboard it's located on and description, DASHBOARD: Description)</p><p></p><p>Creating an infrastructure that can be easily adhered to and adopted will help keep your Performance Analytics teams and internal organizations working efficiently long-term. Once you have a solid workable system in place, you can build on it and tweak it when changes are made. Having a clean environment enables users to find what they need quickly without having to search through hundreds of records. It prevents duplicated efforts because people don't just give up searching for what they need and create new. Lastly it is manageable for the admin responsible for keeping PA structured.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><br/></em></p><p style="text-align: left;">Check out the follow-up posts to this entry:</p><p style="text-align: left;"><a __default_attr="4364" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Development Environment" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=74dd66e9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96199b" modifiedtitle="true" title="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Development Environment">Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Development Environment</a></p><p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Quality Control" __default_attr="4383" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Quality Control" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=0a0deaa5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96191a">Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Quality Control</a><em><br/></em></p><p></p><p><em style="text-align: center;">Also see how you can introduce performance analytics at your own organization <a __default_attr="4166" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="[K15 Session Review] @NOW: How We Embraced Performance Analytics" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=9e8c2ae1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961923" modifiedtitle="true" style="color: #2989c5;" title="[K15 Session Review] @NOW: How We Embraced Performance Analytics">[K15 Session Review] @NOW: How We Embraced Performance Analytics</a> and view the e-learning course on how to use PA </em><a __default_attr="2131" __jive_macro_name="document" class="jive_macro_document jive_macro" data-orig-content="&lt;em&gt;Module 0: How to Use the ServiceNow Performance Analytics Course&lt;/em&gt;" href="/docs/DOC-2131" modifiedtitle="true" style="color: #2989c5; text-align: center;" title="&lt;em&gt;Module 0: How to Use the ServiceNow Performance Analytics Course&lt;/em&gt;"><em>Module 0: How to Use the ServiceNow Performance Analytics Course</em></a></p>
