<p><strong>Introduction :</strong></p><p></p><p>I've been a Service Now user in the past with the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center IT department. Incident and Change Management was a daily function, but I felt the need for bigger and better things to do with Service Now. Implementation of new apps for asset management, meeting room management and others. Working in an education atmosphere came with ridiculously long turn around time on ideas that might lead into development and then possibly hit production. Time in the University world takes 10 times as long to think up an idea and its fruition. Meetings have to happen that are on an agenda, which may or may not have the time to get to, etc. This was a world I could not function in with my OCD and fast paced nature.</p><p></p><p>My tenure for OUHSC IT came to an end when I found a new job that would enable me to dream big, with full support from upper management to find solutions for efficiency, ROI and a "set the pace" mentality. Be an industry leader, not a follower. That is my goal with ServiceNow. I now work in Facilities Management on the same campus of OUHSC. We own and maintain over 1.3 million square feet of a mix of hospital space, office space and public event space. I've been on staff for 9 months now and introduced ServiceNow to my employer. They are very excited for the major changes ServiceNow will bring to our organization. The look and feel of our ServiceNow site is as important as the foundation itself. We want to implement a ServiceNow "self service" site that is easy, short and simple for our customers to use. We have already created a beautiful mockup of how we want our ServiceNow front end to look.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="OneCall Web Redesign Mockup-1.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="548f7335dbd01344e9737a9e0f961991.iix" style="height: 376px; width: 620px; float: none;"/><img  alt="OneCall Web Redesign Mockup-2.jpg" class="jive-image image-8" src="0b9b90c2db185344e9737a9e0f96198b.iix" style="height: 376px; width: 620px;"/><img  alt="OneCall Web Redesign Mockup-3.jpg" class="jive-image image-3" src="b95049c6db9097049c9ffb651f961941.iix" style="height: 376px; width: 620px;"/><img  alt="OneCall Web Redesign Mockup-4.jpg" class="jive-image image-4" src="c14dd0c6dbdc17049c9ffb651f96191a.iix" style="height: 376px; width: 620px;"/><img  alt="OneCall Web Redesign Mockup-5.jpg" class="jive-image image-5" src="6a1d37bddbd01304b322f4621f961945.iix" style="height: 376px; width: 620px;"/><img  alt="OneCall Web Redesign Mockup-6.jpg" class="jive-image image-6" src="f340290adb9cd344e9737a9e0f9619f9.iix" style="height: 376px; width: 620px;"/><img  alt="OneCall Web Redesign Mockup-7.jpg" class="jive-image image-7" src="74cf7842db9c9304b322f4621f96193f.iix" style="height: 376px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Goals :</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">1.
