<p>New in Geneva is ServiceNow Studio cloud IDE - that transforms developer productivity by delivering a familiar experience that developers expect with all tools in one place. Features like Application Explorer, Go To File Search, Code Search, intelligent scripting, and tabbed development make app dev on ServiceNow faster and easier so developers can get more stuff done faster. You can publish from Studio to your test and production instances and even to the ServiceNow Store, and easily manage upgrades via the app repository.</p><p></p><p>Studio is 100% cloud based so there's nothing to download, install, configure, or maintain - it all happens in the browser. And when ServiceNow upgrades Studio, you get it for free, automatically, without doing anything.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Go_to_file_search_Studio_IDE.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="e4590dc6db9497049c9ffb651f961976.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 325px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>You can learn more about Studio <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=cc0ee62ddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619e4">in this blog post</a>.
