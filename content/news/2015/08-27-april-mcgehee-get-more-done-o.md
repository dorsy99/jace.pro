<p>If you don't already know about the <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551115" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551115">favorites functionality of the ServiceNow mobile UI</a> or you just haven't gotten around to setting them up, you should because it will save you a ton of time and make you more efficient.</p><p></p><p>The <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Smartphone_Interface#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Smartphone_Interface#gsc.tab=0">mobile user interface</a> Favorites feature is a list of icons that appears on your mobile homepage. These can be used to create a shortcut to any record, list, form or catalog item. When users log into the mobile UI for the first time, they'll see some instance generated defaults that can be deleted or modified without affecting any other users. This means that you can skip the filtering and breadcrumbing and go straight to the record you want. If it is a form or catalog item you view often, this can save a lot of hassle much like having your mom and dad on speed dial.</p><p></p><p>Favorites make accessing your frequently used customized lists easier. For example, let's say you have a list you use on a regular basis and every time you log back into your instance you have to reapply your filters. This can be really frustrating (especially if you have big ol' meaty fingers), using a mobile favorite can eliminate this process. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Maybe you also have catalog items you use frequently or a specific record you need to keep an eye on, both of these are also great candidates for your mobile interface favorites list. The easiest way to think about it is like bookmarking and creating shortcuts on your desktop for the sites you use the most often, but in this case they are ServiceNow items.</span></p><p></p><h2>How to setup your Favorites on your Mobile device:</h2><ol><li>Browse to the desired record, list, form, or catalog item.</li><li>Tap and hold the homepage button on the lower left of the screen. <img   alt="home icon.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="24" src="4674f7b1dbd8df04e9737a9e0f9619ad.iix" style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em; height: 24.1818181818182px; width: 28px;" width="28"/></li><li>A pop-up will appear where the Title, Color, and Icon of the new favorite can be set.</li><li>Pick a color, name your favorite, and click save.</li></ol><p><img   alt="home favorites.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="f9b7150adb9813043eb27a9e0f961987.iix" style="height: 493px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Setting up default Mobile home page favorites</h2><p>Your favorites can also be accessed directly through your instance by navigating to <strong>System Mobile UI â†’ Home Page Favorites. </strong>This list records the favorites for all users. You may notice some records with a blank user field, these are <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Configuring_the_Smartphone_Interface#Defining_Default_Home_Page_Favorites" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Configuring_the_Smartphone_Interface#Defining_Default_Home_Page_Favorites">default favorites</a> given to all users.</p><p></p><p>You can create default favorites for your users by using the process above, then clearing out the user field in the <strong>System Mobile UI â†’ Home Page Favorites </strong>settings in your desktop UI. You can also manually add favorites here by clicking the <strong>New</strong> button. Creating a new default favorite won't automatically push this to existing users. Though you can still manually add these favorites for existing users. This is done by either going to the record and using the <strong>Insert</strong> to duplicate the record, then adding the users name. Or you can delete the existing users current favorites which will reset them to new default favorites like they're a new user again.</p><p></p><p>Trying to add favorites to multiple accounts can be a difficult and time consuming process, which is why we don't recommend it. The favorites functionality is designed to set-up customization for individual user by the user. Not everyone accesses the same record, form, or list item throughout a 200-person company.</p><p></p><p>Setting up your Mobile UI favorites is quick and easy. Taking five minutes to set up your customizations can save you the pain and time of going in a reapplying those pesky filters and searching through your service catalog to find that frequently used item. Now you can use that time for other things, such as a quick game of ping-pong with the co-workers or having a walking a meeting with your team mate.</p>
