<p>We're making a change to how we're handling questions submitted through the incident form on HI for a pilot group of customers. The pilot group is made up of customers that have HI accounts that match their Community account. The details can be found in <a title="Filing questions from HI to the Community" __default_attr="5027" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Filing questions from HI to the Community" data-renderedposition="29.815340042114258_479.5026550292969_284_16" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=1d2d26e5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619cb">Filing questions from HI to the Community</a>.</p><p></p><p>It's something new that we're trying out to see if it provides our customers with a better experience. The community's vibrant user base can provide customers with a response faster and more efficiently. I figured you may find this pilot program interesting, especially since some of you may fall into our pilot group!</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">If you are one of the selected users who can experience this new process we'd love to hear your feedback so that we can evolve and improve the process.</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">---</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">Make sure you follow your question posted from HI to the community by clicking "follow" on the top-right.
