<p>You may have heard that we are rolling out a pilot program to get your <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/blogs/blog/2015/11/04/changing-how-hi-questions-are-answered">HI questions</a> answered quicker and more efficiently. Well, <strong><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0552759" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0552759">the pilot program is now LIVE</a></strong> for a select group of HI users.</p><p></p><p>How do you know if you are a part of this program? Simple. If you try to log an incident in HI and select one of the following incident categories:</p><ul><li>HI Administration</li><li>Knowledge Management</li><li>Incident Management</li><li>Service Catalog</li><li>Problem Management</li><li>Change Management</li><li>Portfolio Management</li><li>Performance Analytics</li><li>Reporting</li><li>Authentication</li><li>Email</li></ul><p></p><p>...the radio button "Ask a question" appears. If you choose to ask a question, the form will change. This pilot program is only available to users on the community whose email address for their community account matches their email address used for their HI account.</p><p></p><p>You will be asked to state your question, and provide details about your question. Keep your question short, and use the details section to give context. As you type your question, HI will do a quick search of the Knowledge Base to see if we have anything already existing that might be of assistance.</p><p><img   alt="hi question to community.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="535edc82db985344e9737a9e0f9619cb.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 266px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Once submitted, a pop-up will give you a link to your community question, as well as the opportunity to let us know what you think of the experience. You can find all of your community questions posted from HI, by clicking on the "Community Posts" tab while on the "My Issues" page.</p><p><img   alt="community posts tab.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="5feb7ff9db545fc03eb27a9e0f96199f.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 127px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">ServiceNow will monitor questions posted to the community from HI, as a part of this program</span>. <strong>Any questions submitted from HI to the community that go unanswered will be turned into incidents.</strong> There is no need to be concerned if your question will be answered, because if it does not get answered on the community, then our team will revert it to an Incident and help you directly.</p><p></p><p>If you are one of the select HI users with the ability to take part in this, we encourage you to give us feedback on your experience.
