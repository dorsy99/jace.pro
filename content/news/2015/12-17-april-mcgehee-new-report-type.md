<p>Last week was very exciting with the market launch for Geneva. There are quite a few <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551916" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551916">enhancements made in Geneva</a>, but the change that tickles my fancy is the new reporting types. As a business analyst at ServiceNow new functionalities that help me better understand and visualize the data is critical in helping my team make educated business decisions. In the Geneva release, you can look forward to a few new types of report charts like single score charts, multi-level pivot charts, bubble charts, and heat maps!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the new report types we've also got these <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/release_notes/performance_analytics_reporting/r_ReportingRN.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/release_notes/performance_analytics_reporting/r_ReportingRN.html">new reporting features:</a></p><ul><li>Multi data sets - these new sets allow us to use multiple sets of data from different tables in one report using one or multiple visualizations</li><li>Report drill downs - drill down in reports to view a subset of the data. Define unique visualizations and report settings for each level.</li><li>Interactive filters - filter multiple reports on a homepage or dashboard using a single widget. Create and reuse complex filters and apply them to multiple reports at once.</li></ul><p></p><p>Here's a look at the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/use/reporting/reference/r_ReportTypes.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/reporting/reference/r_ReportTypes.html">new chart types</a> you can implement in Reporting once you upgrade to Geneva:</p><p></p><h3>Single score charts</h3><p>These are used to display a single metric or score. Here is how you can <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/basic_reporting/task/t_CreateASingleScoreChart.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/basic_reporting/task/t_CreateASingleScoreChart.html">create a single score chart.</a></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Single+score+card geneva.jpg" class="image-5 jive-image" src="7797240edb14dfc03eb27a9e0f96196f.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 188px;"/></p><h3>Multilevel pivot charts</h3><p>Multi level pivot charts allows you to display aggregated data broken down by multiple metrics in a single chart.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Multi+level+pivot geneva.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" height="554" src="34f684cedb5c5fc068c1fb651f96191d.iix" style="height: 555px; width: 354.618451025057px;" width="354"/></p><h3>Bubble charts</h3><p>Bubble charts are best for displaying separate metrics on one chart, this one is similar to a scatter plot. Here is how to <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/use/basic_reporting/concept/c_BubbleCharts.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/basic_reporting/concept/c_BubbleCharts.html">create a Bubble Chart</a></p><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Bubble+chart geneva.jpg" class="image-7 jive-image" height="354" src="01a1998adb989f048c8ef4621f961900.iix" style="width: 537px; height: 354.246774193548px;" width="537"/></p><h3>Heatmaps</h3><p>Heat map charts allow you to display aggregated data visually using a light to dark color scale to show you how a value increases or decreases. Here is how to <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/basic_reporting/task/t_CreateAHeatmapReport.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/use/basic_reporting/task/t_CreateAHeatmapReport.html">Create a heatmap report</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Heatmap geneva reporting.jpg" class="image-8 jive-image" height="389" src="245d4586db9413043eb27a9e0f96191c.iix" style="width: 563px; height: 389.559677419355px;" width="563"/></p><p></p><p>The reporting application has become by best friend or my bread and butter as I like to call it. Once you've learned how to harness the power of reports Â  you can bring so much value to your company or organization. I personally use it to find data trends in Incident, Problem, and Knowledge, and as a result we are able to strategize and implement Knowledge creation in areas that are most relevant.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">How are you going to use these new chart types in your organization?</p>
