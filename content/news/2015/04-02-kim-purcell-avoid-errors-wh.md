<p>If you've upgraded to Eureka through Patch 3, you may have encountered errors when you enter null or zero length strings into the <strong>Search</strong> field. For example, if you were to enter a space (null) in your Service Catalog <strong>Search</strong> field and click the <strong>Search</strong> icon, the application node (which handles all the user requests from the browser) will almost instantly run out of memory. You won't see an error message; instead, the application node will restart itself, and you'll be asked to log back in and authenticate.</p><p></p><p>To fix this issue, the best solution is to upgrade to Patch 4. You can also turn off the <strong>Search Suggestion</strong> feature to avoid this error. By default, Service Catalog searches display "Did you mean?" suggestions if a search does not return any results and an alternate spelling or recent search does. To disable these suggestions, you should set your <tt><strong>glide.sc.search.suggestions</strong></tt><strong> </strong>property to <strong>false</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>To disable the Search Suggestions property:</h2><p></p><ol><li>In the navigation filter, enter <strong>sys_properties.list</strong>.</li><li>Go to the Â  <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">glide.sc.search.suggestions <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">property</span></span>.</li><li>Set the <strong>Value</strong> field to <strong>false</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Update</strong>.</li></ol><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-03 at 10.00.24 AM.JPG" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7f91bc4adbd8dfc03eb27a9e0f961921.iix" style="height: 311px; width: 620px; border: #BDBDBD 4px solid; border-radius: 15px;"/></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br/>Disabling this property should stop these errors next time you attempt a search.</p><p></p><p>For more information, see:</p><p><a title="Known Error of the week: Out-of-memory conditions in Eureka" __default_attr="4239" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Known Error of the week: Out-of-memory conditions in Eureka" data-renderedposition="782.984375_8_409_16" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=c33e22addbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96191b">Known Error of the week: Out-of-memory conditions in Eureka</a></p><p><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0541299" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0541299">After upgrading to Eureka, an out of memory condition occurs</a></p><p><a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Managing_the_Homepage_for_a_Catalog#Disabling_Search_Suggestions" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Managing_the_Homepage_for_a_Catalog#Disabling_Search_Suggestions">Disabling Search Suggestions </a></p>
