<p>We all have been there... You are searching around and realize that you inadvertently deleted some records. Because it is better to be proactive rather than reactive, I suggest that you enable a certain plugin that makes restoring data a breeze. The <strong>"Restore deleted records"</strong> function, is a plugin that is not active by default in the base system. It allows you to restore records from the moment you <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Activating_ServiceNow_Plugins" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Activating_ServiceNow_Plugins">enable the plugin</a> and onwards, so the sooner you activate it the safer you are.</p><p></p><p>T<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">here are limitations regarding the tracking of deleted records in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">ServiceNow that we must consider before we go about retrieving and restoring any lost records.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Limitations of location records:</strong></p><p>1. Record deletions are not tracked on tables with the no_audit_delete=true dictionary attribute.</p><p>2. File attachments are not restored when the record is restored.</p><p>3. Deletions from tables with a sys prefix are not tracked. To track deletions from these tables, add the table name to the glide.ui.audit_deleted_tables property.</p><p></p><p>With that in mind, let's go about <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Restoring_Deleted_Records" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Restoring_Deleted_Records">restoring our deleted data.</a></p><p></p><h1>Restoring Deleted Data:</h1><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Most people are not aware that relationships to other records are not tracked. Th</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 10pt;">at makes restoring the record a little useless since all of the links will be broken.
