<div class="column"><p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'MyriadPro';">Using online onboarding to automate forms and orientation tasks is a sound strategy for lowering costs and getting new hires up to productive speed faster so your organization can get a quicker ROI on its hiring investments. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">When considering automating the onboarding process, consider the following:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><strong style="color: #0b5ab2; font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">30</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;"> That's the number of steps that are involved in the typical onboarding process — counting every form that needs to be filled out ... every approval ... every data entry into various systems, and the like.</span></p><p></p><p><strong style="color: #0b5ab2; font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">14 </strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;">Represents the average number of software systems that are involved in the onboarding process — from applicant tracking systems ... to HR and payroll</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;">applications ... to benefits administration ... to documents management and provisioning solutions ... to training and performance management applications, and others — sales incentive systems, for example.</span></p><p></p><p><strong style="color: #0b5ab2; font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">45</strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;">That's how many days it takes a typical new employee to reach full productivity — costly for employers and demoralizing for the employees!</span></p><p></p><p><strong style="color: #0b5ab2; font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">8 </strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;">Seems like a small number compared to the others, but not when you consider that it represents the percentage of compliance paperwork that's</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;">never collected — and the costs associated with potential litigious situations.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">In addition to the above "administrative" numbers, there are other — even more important — numbers to consider as well. According to AberdeenGroup's Onboarding Benchmark Report, 85% of new hires decide, within the first six months, whether or not they will stay with their new employer. And, according to Gartner, new people coming in to the workforce today will have an average of 20 jobs over the course of their careers. Given all of these numbers, the goal becomes clear: employers today must provide a better new-hire experience. With fewer steps. And lower costs.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black; font-size: 8px;">*</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Calibri; color: black;"> figures from University of Michigan Onboarding study and U.S. Dept of Labor</span></p><p></p></div>
