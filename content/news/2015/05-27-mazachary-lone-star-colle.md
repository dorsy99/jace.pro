<p>Lone Star College is not only a strong ServiceNow customer, but now they are also a ServiceNow training provider.   Their first class, <strong>ServiceNow Administration</strong>, is coming up on June 4.   There are a couple of significant advantages to taking this incredibly useful training.   First, it's local.   ServiceNow doesn't offer a lot of ServiceNow Administration courses here in Houston so many customers are forced to take classes remote over the web or incur travel cost to go to a different location.   Second, the Lone Star class is offered over 4 partial days (Thursday and Friday afternoons for two weeks) rather than 3 long days.   This gives the students the flexibility to absorb and practice the skills they learn each day and generally get more out of the training.   The class is being offered at the Lone Star Campus off of Hwy 249 (the old Compaq campus).</p><p></p><p><a title="w.lonestar.edu/departments/corporatecollege/ServiceNow_June2015_v3_050815.pdf" href="http://www.lonestar.edu/departments/corporatecollege/ServiceNow_June2015_v3_050815.pdf">Here is the link to the flyer</a> as well as more details on the course.   Be sure to register ASAP if you're interested.</p>
