<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;">For older, upgraded instances, if your Update Set Picker is not automatically updating its list of available Update Sets when you create a new one or close an existing one, the problem is with the "ui_update_set_picker" UI Macro.   Older instances, going back as far as Berlin, may not be upgraded properly, because, in order to hide the picker in your Production instance, you must set the Active flag to false and that means a change to the record.   That change marks it a custom record now and no longer upgradeable.   That record will always be viewed as a custom record each time you clone back to development, so will always get skipped on upgrades.</span></p><p><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;">In order to fix it, you will want to revert the record to OOB in your production instance so it will be pushed down to dev during the next clone cycle.   To do this, select "Upgrade History" from the "System Diagnostics" application and find the latest upgrade you've performed and load the record:</span></p><p><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"><img class="jiveImage" height="101px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rOF3KV7WwVB6ZJ9Kz2NLkrEJ8j7xPQg4eRMTet45p4fU75nZOt_LrQ8-VMi-TFCd_hrMAicEp3I0dNtIvMCSIqJ873GA9Gufq5bKN6guAPp9ZNMOCdrU9crPpCDtybrruSEJ63g" style="border-style: none;" width="266px;"/></span></p><p><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;">Filter the "Upgrade Details" related list to show "File name = sys_ui_macro_49a50b9ca9fe3dba0059d0f944e412d1":</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"><br/></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"><img class="jiveImage" height="195px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/t5DGlwrP3QjJFnpZVahJESpLkHdp3Axina306m06U-WLnEYP1R4XuRpDiod1uqIJU176BUsk6ACqzXfDJFTEo3YoZo24HN9CRtYq9c3WCeehIGNBh2OkwTBawRp1EA4nNeaP8q8" style="border-style: none;" width="869px;"/></span></p><p><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;">You should end up with 1 record showing in the list with a "Disposition" of "Skipped".   Open that record and click on the "Revert to Out-of-box" button.   This will upgrade the UI Macro to the latest version.   That will fix your production instance.</span></p><p><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;">In order to temporarily <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px;">(until the next clone) </span>fix your development instance, where it really matters, first export the UI Macro record from the production instance as an XML file.   Then, select the "Default" Update Set in development and import that new XML file.   Now you have the latest file in development as well as production.</span></p><p><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;">When you now turn the UI Macro on (in development) and off (in production), that change is no longer considered a custom change, so you will still get automatic updates to the macro.   This is because of a feature that was added way back in Calgary - <a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Administering_Update_Sets#Excluding_Fields_from_Updates" style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;" title="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Administering_Update_Sets#Excluding_Fields_from_Updates">Administering Update Sets - ServiceNow Wiki</a></span></p>
