<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 1.5em;">One of the most talked about new features in the Geneva release of ServiceNow is the </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/security/blog/2015/11/10/techbytes-episode-8-servicenow-security-incident-response" style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 1.5em;"> Security Incident Response application</a><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 1.5em;">. As the name suggests, this application provides a logical and organized way to manage security issues and threats. Many organizations have systems in place to detect intrusions, malware, and security breaches of all kinds, but the process of tracking and resolving these incidents is often left to email threads and spreadsheets. The Security Incident Response application fills that gap by using the power of ServiceNow to track security incidents from analysis to containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review. The Security Incident Response application is part of the ServiceNow Security Operations package.</span></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 1.5em;">The Security Instance Response application itself contains some useful security checks. For example, you can add users to a security incident administrator group, a special group that has access to security information that even users with the admin role cannot see.</span></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 1.5em;">This is a general overview of the Security Incident Response application and is the first in a series of posts about this new feature. </span></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"></p><h2>Creating a security incident</h2><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">There are several methods for creating a security incident, including manual and automatic options. This ensures that you can create security incidents when and where you need to. Security incidents are managed by a security group that determines who can see what information about the incident. The security group can see all the details, but, for example, the legal department, the human resources department, and the IT department may have tasks associated with the security incident, but they won't know the whole story. This is a different process than regular incidents traditionally managed by the IT department.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">Manually create security incidents from:</p><ul><li>incidents</li><li>Security Incident form</li><li>Self-Service Security Incident Catalog</li></ul><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">Manually convert any of the following into security incidents:</p><ul><li>security request</li><li>existing alert</li><li>vulnerability record</li></ul><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">In addition to manually creating or converting, you can configure alert rules (defined in the Event Management application) to create security incidents automatically.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><h2>Monitoring security incidents</h2><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">The Security Incident Response application contains security dashboards with gauges and reports that show the status of security incidents. The dashboard information updates in real-time to provide you with the latest news about the progress of security incidents and the impact of the incidents. Use the dashboard details to spot trends, keep a close eye on P1s, and identify configuration items affected by security incidents.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; text-align: center;"><img   alt="security_incident_response3.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="ca5ad50adb1c1b04ed6af3231f961918.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 413px;"/></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><h2>Reviewing security incidents</h2><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">Some security incidents may require a post-incident review. This often occurs with security incidents that have legal, public relations, or auditing ramifications. Writing a post-incident review can be a tedious and time-consuming process. The Security Incident Response application makes the Â  process easier by enabling you to flag an incident for review (establishing that the incident cannot be closed until the review has been generated), send questionnaires to people that worked on the incident to gather information, and generate the first draft of the report automatically. Sections in the report include Summary, Lessons learned, Incident Team, Timeline, Findings, and Resolution.</p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; text-align: center;"><img   alt="security_incident_response2.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="b453ff35db98df04e9737a9e0f9619ba.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p></p><h2>Additional information:</h2><ul><li>The Security Incident Response application cross-references the <a title="w.nist.gov/" href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) database.</li><li>For a visual look at a security incident, use the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Business_Service_Management_Map" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Business_Service_Management_Map">Business Service Map (BSM).</a></li><li>The Security Incident Response application integrates with several third-party software programs including Splunk.</li><li>You can launch a bridge call directly from a security incident.</li><li>To hear about the features in the Security Incident Response application from two senior ServiceNow developers that created the application, listen to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/security/blog/2015/11/10/techbytes-episode-8-servicenow-security-incident-response">Episode 8 of Techbytes</a>, the ServiceNow podcast.</li></ul>
