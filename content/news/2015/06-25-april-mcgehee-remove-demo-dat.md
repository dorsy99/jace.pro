<p>As an internal user or user with a customer_admin or partner_admin role you can <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550107" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550107">remove demo data from your instances</a>. Rather than opening an incident, your request should be routed through a Service Catalog item, which will generate a Change Request. The process behind the scenes has not changed, but the manner in which the request for removals come in for processing has and is streamlining the process by providing a self-service approach.   We've made the request process quick and easy so you can clean up your instance and get the ball rolling with your real data.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Demo data screenshot.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="c54e4d02db181b04ed6af3231f961994.iix" style="height: 307px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Removing demo data using the Service Catalog:</h2><p>Users who have the customer admin or partner admin role and internal users can request demo data removal on an instance using the service catalog, instead of submitting the request as an incident.</p><p></p><ol start="1"><li>Navigate to <a title="i.service-now.com/" href="https://hi.service-now.com/">hi.service-now.com</a>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Self-Service &gt; Remove Demo Data</strong>.</li><li>Specify the instance from which to remove demo data.<ul><li><em>If you are having trouble finding your instance, preface the instance name with "*" to perform a "contains" query.</em></li></ul></li><li>Specify the date and time to remove demo data from the selected instance.<ul><li><em>The date and time must be at least 4 hours later than the current time.</em></li></ul></li><li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li></ol><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">A new change request is created and will display automatically.
