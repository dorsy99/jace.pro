<p>We are simplifying the overall <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Requesting_a_Version_Entitlement#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Requesting_a_Version_Entitlement#gsc.tab=0">HI entitlement experience </a>by allowing you (our customers) to request it directly from the 'Manage Upgrades' page on the CSS portal. This is just one of a few things <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=f30d6ea5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96199f">we have updated on the CSS portal</a>. The old process required multiple steps for both the customer submitting the request and the ServiceNow entitlement manager executing the request. This results in quite a bit of time being used for just one process. The simplified process will save you a few steps and as a result, save us all time.</p><p></p><h2>Request and track upgrades and entitlements from a single dashboard</h2><ul><li>Customers can go directly to the Manage Upgrades page of the CSS Portal and submit their request. At the same time, they can specify the date on which the upgrade should take place after the request is approved.</li><li>Upgrade change records are automatically created for the customer after the request is approved, eliminating the need to go back and manually schedule an upgrade.</li></ul><p><img   alt="upgrade_enhancement.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="4c1e77f1dbd45fc03eb27a9e0f961955.iix" style="height: 243px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>See a full list of entitlement requests</h2><ul><li>Customers can now review all entitlement requests using a new link on the 'Manage Upgrades' page.</li></ul><p></p><h2>Leave comments on entitlement requests</h2><ul><li>Entitlement managers and customers can communicate using the new Comments field on the request form.
