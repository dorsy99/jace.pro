<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">If everything in the enterprise really is or can be a service, what's next on the service management and delivery horizon? At a growing number of enterprises, it is or could be contract services management. Herewith, in no particular order, some inspiring, if not corroborating, nuggets of evidence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Said nuggets result from my attendance at Accelerate 2015, a conference produced by a company called <a title="w.apttus.com/" href="http://www.apttus.com/">Apttus</a>. Said company is delivering disruptive innovation in multiple revenue-related arenas, notably contract, quote-to-cash (QTC), and configure, price, and quote (CPQ) management. And they are doing so via a purpose-built application platform running on Salesforce.com's Salesforce1 infrastructure platform.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Accelerate 2015 reportedly had some 2,000 attendees, approximately twice the number who attended Accelerate 2014. (You know, like Knowledge13 compared with Knowledge12.) And t</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">he customers and partners I encountered were some of the most engaged, upbeat, and business-savvy ecosystem members I've seen outside of a ServiceNow Knowledge conference.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Partners, sponsors and exhibitors at the event included Accenture, Cloud Sherpas, Deloitte Digital, and PwC — all significant players in the ServiceNow ecosystem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">I got to spend a sliver of my time at Accelerate 2015 with Kamal Ahluwalia, Chief Marketing Officer at Apttus. Here's a dramatic reenactment of part of that conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Me: What's the one thing Apttus customers don't yet fully "get?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Kamal: The breadth and depth of our platform.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Me: What's the one thing analysts and influencers following Apttus don't yet fully "get?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Kamal: the speed at which we move — Web speed. We do things in months that those who follow us think will take years.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Me: What's the next big thing?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Kamal: Helping to enable more customers and partners to take greater advantage of the power of our platform — at Web speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Another noteworthy similarity between Accelerate 2015 and past Knowledge conferences: lots of sessions featuring Apttus customers. One featured Brian Lille, CIO at <a title="w.servicenow.com/customer-details.html#Equinix" href="http://www.servicenow.com/customer-details.html#Equinix">Equinix</a>, and a long-time ServiceNow champion. In response to a question from me, he said that he and his team are exploring ways to integrate the strengths of the Apttus and ServiceNow platforms. The goal is to bring more improvements to contract management at Equinix, within and beyond IT. (If you missed him at Accelerate 2015, you can see him speak at Knowledge15. Feel free to pass along greetings from me.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Remember when no one outside of IT cared about IT service management, until the realization that IT services enable the business? ServiceNow certainly does.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Remember when no one outside of compliance, risk, or security management cared about governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) management? Today, enterprise decision makers increasingly realize the GRC is really about making their organizations more agile, resilient, and trustworthy. And ServiceNow has added enhancements to its <a title="w.servicenow.com/products/it-governance-risk-and-compliance.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/it-governance-risk-and-compliance.html">GRC solution</a>, and the team of experts from Intréis, a GRC-specialized partner, to its <a title="w.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-expands-into-governance-risk-and-compliance.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-expands-into-governance-risk-and-compliance.html">internal staff</a>.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Whether it's an internal service level agreement (SLA) or the document describing a primary external business relationship, the contract defines how your business does business. Contract management is therefore a service with high business value, and one that would benefit immensely from greater automation, consolidation, and modernization. You know, like IT service management. Or GRC management. Or enterprise service management.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">I expect that when Accelerate 2016 rolls around, there will be even more members of the ServiceNow ecosystem participating as presenters, exhibitors, and attendees. And I expect that decision makers at more enterprises will already be talking about that time in the recent past when none of their colleagues cared about contract management. Meanwhile, you might start or elevate discussions with your legal and contract management specialists about how best to advance contract services management at your enterprise. (If you want to point someone at a view of all of this that is a bit less ServiceNow-centric, try this: "<a title="ww.linkedin.com/pulse/why-contracts-matter-your-enterprise-what-you-should-doing-dortch" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-contracts-matter-your-enterprise-what-you-should-doing-dortch">Why Contracts Matter to Your Enterprise — And What You Should Be Doing About It.</a>"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">What do you think? Am I being naively optimistic, impressively prescient, or late to a party that started a while ago? Please do let me and the rest of the Community know by leaving a comment. Thanks!</span></p>
