<p>Now that I have your attention, I wanted to show you how you can set up the complementary (free!) version of Performance Analytics in your Eureka or Fuji instance.   It's pretty easy to do, and you can get interesting information about trends in your Incident Management process in a matter of minutes if you are using the standard Incident Management fields provided by ServiceNow.</p><p></p><h2>What Do You Get For Free?</h2><p></p><p>Every Eureka and Fuji instance has the in-platform Performance Analytics app.   You can find it in the left-hand navigation pane if you have the admin role.   As you look through the app, you will see you have a number of features available to collect and analyze information about the Incident Management process:</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Pre-configured Indicators:</strong>   There are 15 indicators (automated and formula) available for you to gather statistical information about your Incident Management process.   These indicators provide data that can be used to monitor trend information on items like number of new incidents, number of resolved incidents, average age of open incidents, incident backlog growth, and more.</li><li><strong>Pre-configured Breakdowns:</strong>   Breakdowns add a dimension of analysis to your indicators.   For example, you can look at the Number of Open Incidents <strong><em>By</em></strong> Assignment Group.   Or you can see the Number of New Incidents <strong><em>By</em></strong> Priority. There are 5 breakdowns available to you for the Incident Management process including age, assignment group, category, priority, and state.</li><li><strong>Pre-configured Dashboards:</strong>   The indicators and breakdowns are the building blocks to collect and analyze the data in Performance Analytics.   Dashboards give you the ability to present the data in a meaningful way to your organization.   You will see 2 dashboards available to you (with each dashboard having multiple tabs and widgets) to visualize the data for your Incident Management process.</li></ul><p></p><h2>How Do You Get Started With Performance Analytics?</h2><p></p><p>Getting started with Performance Analytics is easy if you are using the standard fields provided by ServiceNow for the Incident Management process.   Just do the following (once you have permission to make the change in your production environment!):</p><p></p><h3>Activate the Performance Analytics Plugin</h3><p></p><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>System Definition &gt; Plugins</strong>.</li><li>Search for the <strong>Performance Analytics</strong> plugin.</li><li><strong>Activate</strong> the plugin if it is not currently active.</li></ol><p></p><p><img   alt="paplugin.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="9accf3f1db185704ed6af3231f9619bf.iix" style="height: 157px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p>By default, the Performance Analytics (and Performance Analytics Data Collector) plugin is Active on all new instances.   It is quite possible that you will not even need to complete this step.</p><p></p><h3><a name="historic"></a>Collect Historic Incident Management Data</h3><p></p><p>Now it is time to collect the statistical data for Incident Management in your instance.   Perform the following steps to make that happen:</p><p></p><ol><li>Navigate to Performance <strong>Analytics &gt; Data Collector &gt; Jobs</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>[PA Incident] Historic Data Collection</strong> job from the list.<br/><br/><img   alt="jobhistoric.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="1141a1cadbd8d304b322f4621f961976.iix" style="height: 332px; width: 620px;"/><br/><br/></li><li>In the <strong>Job Parameters</strong> section, check the <strong>Active</strong> checkbox.</li><li>In the <strong>Job Parameters</strong> section, ensure the <strong>Run</strong> setting is set to <strong>On Demand</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Execute Now</strong> button to start the job.<br/><br/><img   alt="historicdetail.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="f69ab48adb9cdfc068c1fb651f9619f1.iix" style="height: 280px; width: 620px;"/></li></ol><p></p><p>As configured, the historic data collection job will collect data for the prior 60 days.   You can increase this value to import more data; however, only the prior 180 days will be displayed in the complementary version of Performance Analytics.   The scores will be stored in the database, but only the prior 180 days will be presented.</p><p></p><h3>Activate the Incident Management Daily Data Collection</h3><p></p><p>The historic data collection takes care of past data.   You need to enable the system to collect information on a daily basis going forward to continue the trend analysis.   Performance Analytics has a pre-configured job to help you collect data daily.   Perform the following steps to set up the daily data collection:</p><p></p><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>Performance Analytics &gt; Data Collector &gt; Jobs</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>[PA Incident] Daily Data Collection</strong> job from the list.<br/><br/><img   alt="jobdaily.png" class="jive-image image-2" src="8acc5886db9c9704ed6af3231f961975.iix" style="height: 332px; width: 620px;"/><br/><br/></li><li>In the <strong>Job Parameters</strong> section, check the <strong>Active</strong> checkbox.</li><li>In the <strong>Job Parameters</strong> section, select your timezone from the <strong>Run as tz</strong> dropdown list.</li><li>In the <strong>Job Parameters</strong> section, enter the time of day that you want the job to run in the <strong>Time</strong> field.   You should set a time early in the morning (sometime after midnight) to collect the score from the previous day.   That way the data will be fresh in the morning when you need to present the data.</li><li>Click the <strong>Update</strong> button to save your changes.<br/><br/><img   alt="dailydetails.png" class="jive-image image-3" src="786a3fbddb50db048c8ef4621f9619f6.iix" style="height: 309px; width: 620px;"/></li></ol><p></p><p>You don't have to run this job if you have just run the historic data collection.   This job is to collect the Incident Management data going forward.</p><p></p><h3>Verify Data Collection</h3><p></p><p>After you have performed those steps, verify that the data have been collected by the Data Collector.   Perform the following steps to check the completion of the job:</p><p></p><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>Performance Analytics &gt; Data Collector &gt; Job Logs</strong>.</li><li>Check the <strong>State</strong> of the historic data collection you started.   It will report as <strong>Collected</strong> when the job has finished.<br/><br/><img   alt="joblogcomplete.png" class="jive-image image-4" src="0faa614edb5053043eb27a9e0f961938.iix" style="height: 322px; width: 620px;"/></li></ol><p></p><p>If the job is still running, you will see that the State is Collecting.   Just be patient and check back periodically.   Once complete, you should see a number of Inserts to tell you the statistical data have been collected.</p><p></p><h3>Seeing Your Results</h3><p></p><p>Once you see the data collector has finished, seeing your new data is simple:</p><p></p><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>Performance Analytics &gt; Dashboards</strong>.<br/><br/><img   alt="incidentdata.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="d1b40986db10d344e9737a9e0f9619f3.iix" style="height: 361px; width: 620px;"/></li></ol><p></p><p>You can now start looking at how your Incident Management process is performing.   And you will see new data coming into the system on a daily basis.   Welcome to Performance Analytics!</p><p></p><p>If you are experiencing errors in the Data Collector after going through this article, be sure to check out this article on <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/performance-analytics/blog/2015/08/27/free-performance-analytics-reconfiguring-indicators">reconfiguring indicator sources</a>.   It will take you through the steps needed to repoint Performance Analytics at different fields in your environment.</p>
