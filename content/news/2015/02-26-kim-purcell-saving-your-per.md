<p>If you are upgrading your instance prior to Berlin to a later release, you'll need to activate the <strong>Engine Based Notifications</strong>, which is not activated by default. These give you a much easier way to design and implement notifications with 38 base-system notifications that trigger automatically when records are inserted or updated.</p><p></p><p>But before you activate your plugin, you'll first need to save your personalized notifications so these are not overwritten by the engine-based notifications. These notifications range from Appointment Invites and Change approved to Incident Resolved.
