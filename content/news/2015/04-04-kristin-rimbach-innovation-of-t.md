RKON's mobile-ready application allows employees to create and submit expense reports. Complex organizational and legal expense policies have been incorporated into the application, reducing auditing cycle time and costs. Capturing mileage reimbursement has been simplified through an integration with Google Maps, resulting in consistent and reliable data with reimbursable amount calculations built directly into the application.   In addition, the reports and dashboards bring visibility to this often unseen corporate spend. The audit cycle time has been reduced by 50% and speeding the reimbursement time.</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><p><a name="usps"></a></p><p><img   alt="usps-logo-since-1993.png" class="jive-image image-2" height="49" src="b32a9806dbd89fc068c1fb651f961946.iix" style="height: 49px; width: 290.6590909090909px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="291"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Multi-layered Permissions within Knowledge Management</strong></span></p><p>USPS IT in collaboration with Accenture customized the ServiceNow Knowledge Management standard module into an agile and pioneering solution for not just IT but for the specific needs of the business. The customization entailed enabling IT to seamlessly integrate 15,000 articles, utilize custom key features, define access, streamline the knowledge base creation and review process and integrate with the IT Service Management (ITSM) applications; Incident, Problem, and Change on the ServiceNow platform. The most innovative custom feature in the tool is the capability for Multi - Layered Permissions within a single article.   By restricting sections of a single article to have only pre-defined view accessibility to union versus non-union workers, the ServiceNow Integration team was able to design and construct the knowledge management application with agility to continuously meet the demands of the Union.</p><p></p><hr/><p><a name="national"></a></p><p><img   alt="national-cancer-institute.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="94" src="ed57594adb1c97049c9ffb651f9619ea.iix" style="height: 94.37704918032787px; width: 171px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="171"/></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>KM ² - Knowledge Management &amp; Mobility</strong></span></p><p class="p1">Knowledge Management &amp; Mobility, or KM ² is the product of a partnership between the National Cancer Institute and SRA International. KM ² builds a culture of inherent and mutual trust between technicians and customers by giving IT staff focused access to the information they need to provide top-notch service. Technicians scan a QR barcode with a mobile device and are provided immediate access to information such as office floorplans, asset information, detailed customer information, incident history (and creation), device-specific technical documentation, vendor support agreements, information to re-order supplies, and device history. This solution enables the NCI to migrate to a new, improved way of managing and finding documentation and related knowledge.   The impact will be realized every day for years to come and from now on, NCI's cancer research and treatment will be more efficiently supported, without frequent disruption.</p><p></p><p>Learn More: <br/><a href="http://goo.gl/5j4m2T">Video<br/></a><img   alt="NCIfloorPlan.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="120" src="82c47486db1cdfc068c1fb651f961930.iix" style="height: 120.16666666666667px; width: 206px;" width="206"/><img   alt="NCIprinterHome.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="118" src="5f143735db105fc03eb27a9e0f9619da.iix" style="height: 118.02325581395348px; width: 203px;" width="203"/><img   alt="NCIqrGenerator.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" height="125" src="b4407f39db1c1fc068c1fb651f96191a.iix" style="height: 124.83870967741933px; width: 215px;" width="215"/></p><p></p><p></p><hr/><p><a name="symfoni"></a></p><p><img   alt="symfoni.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="46" src="d8ec7735db185704ed6af3231f9619e3.iix" style="height: 45.94285714285714px; width: 268px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="268"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>VIP Management Suite</strong></span></p><p class="p1">Managing a company is often done with multiple spreadsheets, stored in different locations, edited by various people. But, information around company strategy, supporting company budgets and KPI's is essential to steer a company in the right direction. If this information is scattered all over the place it may lead to wrong decisions. The VIP Management Suite includes 4 applications:</p><ul><li>Strategy Control (based on <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshin_Kanri" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshin_Kanri">Hoshin kanri</a>) - to capture and cement strategic goals as well as flashes of insight about the future and developing the means to bring these into reality</li><li>Budget Control - used to determine detailed budgets for every department or team in the company</li><li>KPI Control - to easily define and compare KPI's for teams and departments</li><li>Meeting Control - integrated with ServiceNow Visual Taskboards to take notes during meetings and share the notes with the people in the meeting group, without sending around emails.</li></ul><p class="p1">Now the entire management group is in control of the full value chain - from vision to steering.</p><p></p><hr/><p><a name="liveboard"></a></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong><img   alt="3a7a394.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="f0406106db94d7041dcaf3231f96192e.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>TV Liveboard Management</strong></span></p><p class="p1">Managers, Engineers, and every department wants to be aware of information that is relevant for the entire organization at the same time. For examle: Sometimes there is a critical issue and managers aren't even aware of this because they are not always working in ServiceNow. A powerful way to communicate throughout the entire organization are TV screens (narrowcasting). With the Liveboard Management application in ServiceNow you can manage information to share with everyone on TV screens. You can create multiple liveboards using intuitive drag-and-drop and a simple look-and-feel. Save your liveboard and see your information being cast throughout the entire company using television screens.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Company News, headlines, twitter feeds, SCRUM progress, Live SLA timers for Priority 1 tickets, Real-time statistics about critical servers and much more…meaning: you can create your own information blocks and show this on the Liveboard.</span></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p class="p1">An additional feature is NFC integration. By holding a company badge against a NFC reader, the Ixiium Liveboard will instantly switch to your relevant personal information like: Outlook Calendar, assigned work in ServiceNow, out-of-office overview, personal statistics. After 1 minute the liveboard changes back to the configured company Liveboard.</p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/c-Fj9KXUjxs" width="194" height="160"/></p><p></p><p class="p1"><img   alt="liveboard2.JPG" class="image-1 jive-image" height="124" src="8c09f88adbd89344e9737a9e0f9619e3.iix" style="height: 124.19354838709674px; width: 220px;" width="220"/><img   alt="liveboards1.JPG" class="image-0 jive-image" height="121" src="e15d95cadb1c13043eb27a9e0f9619ae.iix" style="height: 121.49677419354839px; width: 214px;" width="214"/><img   alt="liveboards3.JPG" class="jive-image image-2" height="120" src="d83a504edb989fc03eb27a9e0f9619d8.iix" style="height: 120.46129032258065px; width: 214px;" width="214"/></p><p><a href="http://ixiium.com/IxiiumInnovationAward.pdf"><br/>Learn More</a></p><p></p><hr/><h1 style="text-align: center;"></h1><h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>C5NOW</strong></h1><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Process Assessment using COBIT 5 PAM</strong></span></p><p class="p1">This innovation provides automation support with ServiceNow, replacing traditional manual documentation activities.

They were faced with scattered information, multiple systems, spreadsheets, and contact lists. They created a complete store facility management system containing information retrieved from both existing systems, outlook contacts and excel sheets. They added both reactive functions like incident reporting and service catalog - and proactive functions like projects, service agreements and store inventory. The allowed them to deliver an easy to use portal for store users, making incident reporting simple and providing information via knowledge articles. Additionally, store updates and repairs such as painting or broken fixtures can be tracked and utilized for future planning.</p><p></p><p>Learn More:<a title="ww.youtube.com/watch?v=X-dz1rAMwGg&feature=youtu.be" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-dz1rAMwGg&amp;feature=youtu.be">Video</a></p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/X-dz1rAMwGg" width="202" height="166"/></p><p></p><p></p><hr/><p></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Cast your votes <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/knowledge-user-conference/knowledge15/content-programs/innovation">HERE</a>.</strong></span></p>
