<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img   alt="Swisscom.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="87" src="79b59486db9817049c9ffb651f961967.iix" style="height: 87px; width: 128.26923076923077px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="129"/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>BoostGDN (General Defense Network)</strong></span></p><p class="p1">Ordering temporary communications lines for Swiss military maneuvers used to be done by filling out complex Excel sheets and mailing them to a dedicated team within the Swiss military and Swisscom. The delivery process was tedious too, involving the manual tracking and coordination of multiple tasks, entering complex data in various backend systems and manually generating Excel invoices. This resulted in human errors, long and unpredictable delivery times and a lack of transparency. So, Swisscom developed an end-to-end solution for the Swiss military's need for temporary communications links. The solution comprises a dedicated military portal, automated validation and plausibility checks for orders, with fully automated workflows and approvals. Users can register directly in the portal, get approved by the military, order communications lines to known or new locations for maneuvers (even geo coordinates) and check on progress. They can also log assurance issues for their services. Swisscom is aided by a comprehensive workflow and backend system integrations to insure impeccable service delivery. The system even automatically gathers billing information, and generates PDF invoices that are approved by the military prior to payment. Now, the delivery effort for GDN business has been reduced by more than 50%. Errors have practically disappeared altogether and the rejection rate of invoices has gone down by over 80%.</p><p></p><hr/><p><img   alt="Australia Post.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="118" src="49b2fbf9db1cdfc0b322f4621f9619ed.iix" style="height: 117.89308176100629px; width: 230px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="230"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>VPN Access Requests</strong></span></p><p class="p1">Australia Post introduced a form for their employees to request VPN access through their Self Service Portal. Once access is approved by a manager, within 3 seconds the customer receives an email that confirms access has been granted, and provides a knowledge article outlining instructions on how to setup VPN. On the back end, the approval calls MID servers to run PowerShell scripts and update ActiveDirectory to enable access for the user. The same process works to modify or remove VPN access. This streamlined process allows the team to focus on other tasks in the queue, eliminates human errors, and improves the overall user experience.</p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"></p><p></p><hr/><p><img   alt="Australia Post.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image jiveImage" height="104" src="49b2fbf9db1cdfc0b322f4621f9619ed.iix" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block; width: 203px; height: 104.05345911949686px;" width="203"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>PUK Code Request</strong></span></p><p class="p1">Simplifying a process from days to minutes can drastically improve productivity and the way work gets done. At Australia Post, users requesting a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code would typically have to wait for hours or days while the service desk waited on a Telco provider. By automating a weekly Excel feed into a code table, PUK code information is now displayed instantaneously to end users through a self-service catalog request.</p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1"><img   alt="Slide2.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="104" src="8f3250c2dbd05304b322f4621f9619a7.iix" style="height: 103.5px; width: 184px;" width="185"/><img   alt="Slide3.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="107" src="c8407bb1db5c93041dcaf3231f9619fd.iix" style="height: 107.12608695652173px; width: 191px;" width="191"/><img   alt="Slide4.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" height="111" src="fc5d590adbd8130468c1fb651f9619a3.iix" style="height: 110.51982378854626px; width: 196px;" width="197"/></p><p></p><hr/><p><img   alt="University of Michigan.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" height="93" src="61a95d0adb18d304b322f4621f961979.iix" style="height: 93px; width: 178.64028776978415px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="179"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Customizable Notifications </strong></span></p><p class="p1">The University of Michigan wanted to allow their configuration analysts to be able to create and/or modify a notification's subject and/or message body without providing them access to the specific table. So they created a custom table in which configuration analysts can create and modify notifications for a specific Service Provider. This functionality gives users the ability to change the subject/body to what they would like, and upon saving, it maps those changes back to the original notification. Now, Service Providers to know which notifications are related specifically to them and the configuration analysts have an easier way to update notifications to make them more accessible.</p><p class="p1"></p><hr/><p><img   alt="symfoni_ORIGINAL_LOGO.jpg" class="jive-image image-3" height="49" src="b11370c2db5c5f048c8ef4621f961933.iix" style="height: 49.34276729559748px; width: 221px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="221"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Smartwatch Notifications</strong></span></p><p class="p1">How do you track business critical activities during your daily operations?
