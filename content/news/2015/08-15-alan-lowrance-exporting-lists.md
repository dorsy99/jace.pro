<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">Like the wiki says, there are three ways to export a list into a CSV/XLS format:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">On-Demand</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Right-click the top of a list you've already filtered and sorted how you like, and choose Export.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Get the URL for the query and add CSV or EXCEL after the "?" and an "&amp;" before the sysparm_query: </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/[instance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://[instance</a><span> name].service-now.com/incident_list.do?CSV&amp;sysparm_query=[your_query]</span></span></li></ol><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Omnes-pro, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">On a Schedule</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Omnes-pro, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">Create it as a report and schedule it to run and generate an XLS instead of PDF.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">HOWEVER, if you are exporting a multi-line string field such as Description, you will notice if the [Enter] key was used as line breaks or you have \n or \r in there, Excel appears to cut off everything after the first line break.   This is just the way Excel displays these and the data is still in the new file, you just have to advance the cursor past the last word in the cell and it will flip to the next line while staying in the same cell.   You can also page/tab through these lines by using the up and down arrows next to the formula bar in Excel.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Edit: Or just make the cell taller and it will put more than just the first line!   Excel is a lot smarter than you give it credit for sometimes.<br/></span></p>
