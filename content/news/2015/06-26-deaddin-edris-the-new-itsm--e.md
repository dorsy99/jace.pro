<p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">ServiceNow worked closely with Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) on a <a title="w.servicenow.com/thank-you.db3a0510-94ff-45d8-be0e-ba824aa1c694.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/thank-you.db3a0510-94ff-45d8-be0e-ba824aa1c694.html">whitepaper</a> that discusses the convergence of ITSM (IT Service Management) and ITOM (IT Operations Management). EMA, having conducted many industry dialogs along with their data, concluded that integrated operations are essential for improving end-user experience of IT services. Put simply, when ITOM is integrated with ITSM, processes like Incident, Problem, and Change Management become more efficient and IT as a whole becomes far more effective. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The paper focuses on specific areas where ITOM capabilities can enhance an ITSM implementation. Topics include:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Integrated Operations and ITSM: A Bellwether for the New IT: </strong>EMA's research results suggest a number of important benefits: </span></p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Improved end-user experience for internal consumers &#8232;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Integrated operations with ITSM for incident and problem management &#8232;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Integrated operations with ITSM for change and configuration management &#8232;</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The "Service-Aware CMDB": Making Change Work in Support of Service Performance: </strong>Discusses the criticality of a service-aware CMDB to support both ITOM and ITSM</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Other topics in the paper touch on the importance of having a rich and extensible service model as a part of the CMDB to provide a truly comprehensive   "single system of record". It dives into the growing role for service discovery and mapping and the importance of automation to an optimized ITSM + ITOM deployment. Finally, the paper details how an effective service catalog can leverage service models to provide more standardized and automated service provisioning. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Download the paper today and learn how ITSM + ITOM is a 1+1 = 3 (or more). </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>About EMA</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Founded in 1996, Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) is a leading industry analyst firm that provides deep insight across the full spectrum of IT and data management technologies.
