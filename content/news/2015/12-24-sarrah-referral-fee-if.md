<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">We are hiring at all levels within our team to include   <strong>Sr.Solutions Architect, Technical Consultant, Virtual Admin/Consultant, Developer</strong> and <strong>Engagement Manager</strong>. We have several new engagements coming online and are hiring immediately here in the Pacific Northwest and all across the U.S.   For local PNW resources, work will likely occur at local Seattle-area customer sites or from our HQ office in Kirkland.   For non-local residents, work from home with &lt;30% travel!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">Why Covestic?   We have solutions for these job "attributes" that our team members experienced with their former employers:</span></p><p></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><strong>Too many nights and weekends…</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><strong>Too much time on the road, away from your family and friends.</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><strong>Improperly scoped and resourced projects, leaving you "holding the bag" to rescue projects.</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><strong>Failed projects.</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><strong>Turnover — your teammates are regularly leaving for better circumstances.</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><strong>Lack of tools, methodology and deliverables, leaving you to ask yourself the question "Do I work for a staffing firm or a consulting firm"?</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><strong>Compensations package not aligned to your capabilities and contributions.</strong></span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">We value life/work balance — example we will turn down projects that require excessive travel for our consultants.   Our practice-level objective is &lt;30% travel but in reality we achieve much better than that.</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Due to our structure, values and approach, we are able to offer the most aggressive compensation packages in our industry. Compensation packages are constantly re-evaluated to ensure we remain competitive and your individual compensation aligns with your capabilities and contributions. Your performance and compensation will be evaluated, at minimum, annually.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">We provide very straightforward career paths, enabled by professional development, mentoring and smart alignment of resources to projects.   </span></li></ul><p class="activity-content"></p><p class="activity-content" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">With over 250 consultants, our firm does a lot more than just ServiceNow.   This gives our organization diversity and balance and means that we don't aspire to "continuously grow" the ServiceNow practice.   Rather, we aspire to continuously improve/optimize it and are well on our way to being able to confidently say we are the best in the business.   We are achieving this through smart recruiting, methodology, tools, intellectual property development and much more to help institutionalize our quality and consistency.</span></p><p class="activity-content"></p><p class="activity-content" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">Are you open for a new opportunity or is someone you know possibly interested?   We do gladly pay a $ referral fee for candidates that we hire! </span></p><p class="activity-content"></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">Feel free to contact our ServiceNow Practice Director directly to learn more:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">Scott Jacocks</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #666666;"><a href="mailto:sjacocks@covestic.com"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">sjacocks@covestic.com</span></a></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">We look forward to hearing from you!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #666666;">Covestic's career page:   <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/chj.tbe.taleo.net/chj01/ats/careers/jobSearch.jsp?org=COVESTIC2&amp;cws=1" target="_blank">Covestic</a> </span></p>
