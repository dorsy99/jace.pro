<p>Those of you who have upgraded to Eureka are certainly familiar with the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Customizing_Homepages#System_Administration_Homepage" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Customizing_Homepages#System_Administration_Homepage">System Administration</a> homepage. It gives system admins quick access to the most common administrative tasks. The Wiki claims you cannot modify that homepage but I thought I would rather give it a try anyway. As you can imagine, indeed there is a way to tweak that page.</p><p></p><p>Each block on the System Administration homepage (except "10 Things" block) is in fact a catalog category containing a set of <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Adding_Content_Items_to_Service_Catalog" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Adding_Content_Items_to_Service_Catalog">content items</a> that point to various pages in your ServiceNow instance. Together these categories form the Admin Home catalog. (As of Eureka, you can have <a title="iki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Managing_Multiple_Service_Catalogs" href="https://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Managing_Multiple_Service_Catalogs">multiple service catalogs</a> in the same instance.)</p><p></p><p>However, this catalog (as well as all of its categories and items) is by default hidden from everybody, including admins, using "before query" business rules. To gain access to these items, deactivate the following business rules:</p><p></p><ul><li>Hide catalog for admin homepage</li><li>Hide admin homepage categories</li><li>Hide items for admin homepage</li></ul><p></p><p>Alternatively, you can change the Condition in these business rules from <strong>!gs.hasRole("maint")</strong> to, say, <strong>!gs.hasRole("maint") &amp;&amp; !gs.hasRole("admin")</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Now you can easily add, remove, or rearrange items in the categories as you like and change their attributes if necessary. For example, you may want to assign <em>admin</em> role to all the items in the Admin Home catalog. Otherwise, non-admin users can find them using the Global Search. If you do not want admins to see those items in the search results either, set <strong>No search</strong> attribute to <em>true</em> in all of them.</p><p></p><p><img  alt="search_small.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="49036142db50d7049c9ffb651f961954.iix" style="height: 358px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p>Finally, if you want to be able to add or remove entire categories, you will have to modify the Portal Page record for the System Administration homepage as follows:</p><p></p><ol><li>Add <em>admin</em> role to <strong>Write roles</strong> list</li><li>Change <strong>Title</strong> from <em>System Administration</em> to something else</li><li>Change <strong>View</strong> from <em>admin</em> to something else</li></ol><p></p><p>Unlike for other homepages, adjusting <strong>Write roles</strong> alone is not enough in this case. You will not see icons that let you add or remove content unless you modify <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>View</strong>.</p>
