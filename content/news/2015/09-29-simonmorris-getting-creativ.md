<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Look, you're the change manager. We've got to do better than this. We need better situational awareness, and that means we need some sort of functional change management process. Get everyone to bring in their changes so we can build a picture of what is actually going on out there."</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To my surprise, Patty looks dejected. "Look, I've tried this before. I'll tell you what will happen. The Change Advisory Board, or CAB, will get together once or twice. And within a couple of weeks, people will stop attending, saying they're too busy. Or they'll just make the changes without waiting for authorization because of deadline pressures. Either way, it'll fizzle out within a month."</em></p><p><em><br/></em></p><p>One of the many things that I enjoyed from reading "<a title="w.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1443443809&sr=1-1&keywords=the+phoenix+project" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443443809&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+phoenix+project">The Phoenix Project: A novel about IT, DevOps and helping your business win</a>" was how the story cut through the plot, the characters and the words and went straight for the jugular vein of the reader. I've worked in IT Operations, I remember what its like getting that call in the middle of the night. I remember the frustrations with trying to get an effective change management process, and even more importantly... even harder... sustaining that process over time.</p><p></p><p>Gene Kim knew that his words would invoke a visceral, emotional reaction from his readers. I felt levels of despair, helplessness, hope and victory whilst reading the book.</p><p></p><p><strong>The trouble with the process escalation race</strong></p><p></p><p>At the point in the book where I've taken this quote, the protagonists have experienced multiple outages due to unplanned, unapproved changes. Patty is resigned to the fact that if they "reboot" the Change Advisory Board its only a matter of time until stakeholder interest wanes and engineers start to work around the system. Most importantly, she is saying that reinforcing the Change Management process becomes a reactionary response to the problem of outages, rather than a strategic response to reducing the risk of change.</p><p></p><p>When the change management process fails one common response that I've seen is "the process escalation" race. Add more process to the problem in the hope that next time it will stop a recurrence of the issue. For example, add more approvals, increase the lead time, more reviews of test plans and so on.</p><p></p><p>Not that these actions are necessarily bad - they might be perfectly sensible additions to a Change Management process - but it's the reactionary way that they are added that makes them dangerous. And without a thorough root cause analysis of failures introduced by bad changes, there is no guarantee that a recurrence will be avoided.</p><p></p><p>If your stock response to a failure is to instinctively add process to the problem rather than investigate the actual cause - you might be part of that problem!</p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong><br/></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>And that goes double for Change Advisory Board meetings</strong></span></p><p><em><br/></em></p><p>Piling on the process is especially problematic with Change Management because of the nature of CAB meetings. High participation, hard to schedule, heavy on procedure. More than anything they are dull, dull, dull.</p><p><em><br/></em></p><p>I wondered if the experience of CAB meetings had improved in the time since I'd been involved in actively running them.
