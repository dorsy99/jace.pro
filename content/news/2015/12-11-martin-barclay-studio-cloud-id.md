The combination of Studio and ServiceNow Platform services makes leveraged enterprise cloud app development a reality with Geneva.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">What do I mean by "leveraged enterprise cloud app development"?   I'll break it down. But first, let's recall what "leverage" actually means.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you use $100K of your own money to buy $100K of land, you haven't used (financial) leverage. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">On the other hand, if you use $100K of your own money and borrow $400K to buy $500K worth of land, you're using financial leverage. You now control $500K of land with only $100K of your own money.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">If the value of the land goes up 10%, your profit without leverage is $10K. With leverage, your profit is $50K. </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">So think of Studio + Platform services as that $400K loan (interest free and no payment required unless your app is deployed onto a production instance with fulfiller licenses)   in the above example. As the developer, you put in 20% or $100K worth of the overall code of the app — the most valuable part that solves the actual business need for the end user — while   Studio + Platform services provides you with the $400K worth of developer tools and Platform services, enabling you to deliver an app that's actually worth $500K to the business. And, if the number of users of your app exceeds the initial expectation, then the business makes more "profit" ($50K vs $10K). That's leveraged application development.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img   alt="app_explore_tabbed_dev.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="745b304edb109f048c8ef4621f961965.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 325px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">Let's take a closer look at how this is actually delivered in Geneva:</span></p><p></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/servicenow-platform.html"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">The ServiceNow Platform </span></a><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">comes with a comprehensive set of built-in services that do a lot of the heavy lifting that's required with true enterprise-grade app development, for you. This means that every app you develop on the ServiceNow Platform can leverage whichever of these services you choose to incorporate - which slashes app dev and testing time, and exponentially increases your productivity the more apps that you build with these re-usable services. To see what these over twenty Platform Services are, see the almost-complete list in the <a title=".15.10.196/documentation/geneva/release_notes/servicenow_platform/c_ServiceNowPlatformRN.html" href="http://10.15.10.196/documentation/geneva/release_notes/servicenow_platform/c_ServiceNowPlatformRN.html">Platform section of the Geneva release notes</a>, as well as the </span><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/administer/general/reference/r_AutomationPlatform.html"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">pre-Geneva Platform documentation.</span></a><a title="tps/docs.servicenow.com/administer/general/reference/r_AutomationPlatform.html" href="http://https/docs.servicenow.com/administer/general/reference/r_AutomationPlatform.html"> </a><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">I say "almost-complete" because there are even more Platform services available than are listed in those two places - things like Performance Analytics (which all apps can enable), Reporting (which all apps get automatically), and Orchestrations &amp; MID Server (which all apps can leverage).</span></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a title="w.servicenow.com/products/studio.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/studio.html">Studio</a></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"> puts these Platform services at your fingertips in a highly efficient manner you'd expect from an IDE.
