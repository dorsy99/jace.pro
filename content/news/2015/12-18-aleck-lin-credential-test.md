<p>It's often a pain trying to see whether a credential you've entered was actually successful. The only way to really see if it worked was to either run an orchestration workflow or a discovery against a target. Well, you now no longer have to, with the credential tester UI action, you can quickly verify whether you've entered the correct credential for a given target.</p><p></p><p>I've created and posted the credential tester update set on <a title="t.ly/1NyfmC5" href="http://bit.ly/1NyfmC5">ServiceNow Share</a> and it is free to download. It currently supports SSH, WMI/Powershell, and SNMP credential type testing. Please let me know if there's anything that can be improved upon. It will support Geneva and should be backward compatible as well.</p><p></p><p>The link to the update set (manually copy and past the link if it doesn't work) =&gt; <a href="http://bit.ly/1NyfmC5" title="Credential Tester">https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/69b1bf9e13541a0057ce58222244b0d1/overview</a></p><p></p><p>Disclaimer: This utility by no means has gone through rigorous testing.
