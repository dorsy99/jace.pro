ServiceNow responds, "Everything as a Service." And, I couldn't agree more. Unless you are a company of one, then regardless of company size and industry, every employee and every department is a service provider. IT organizations around the world have had this "service provider" concept drilled into them for over a decade, and now departments across the enterprise are starting to embrace the service provider model. In the immortal words of Etta James, "At last."</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jacob's presentation today shared how ServiceNow is using Financial Management to help solve some age old financial management process challenges. Let's recap the top take-a-ways:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Replacing a manual e-mail based purchasing process with an integrated workflow-based process on the ServiceNow platform led to substantial productivity gains for everyone involved in the purchasing process, transparency, and greater transactional accuracy by reducing manual human errors.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Being able to leverage ServiceNow core functionality, from Receiving Slip, ITAM, CMDB and integration to the platform's development capabilities, ServiceNow was able to mash-up and create a powerful solution that solved a burning business problem in a fraction of the time it would have taken to build this the traditional way.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img   alt="itfm-financial-management-workbench.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="e38bbf35db101344e9737a9e0f96195b.iix" style="height: 438px; width: 620px;"/></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After the presentation, I asked Jacob if he had any advice for customers who are starting their financial management implementation journey. He got right to the point:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Clearly define requirements and get sign off</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Organize frequent demos during development</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Break down the project into manageable milestones</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Keep it simple!</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Let's get the party started</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Final question of the day for Jacob, "If Financial management was throwing a ServiceNow Platform party, who would you invite, and why?"</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Vendor Management</strong> - Suppliers and qualifying suppliers is an essential aspect in the procurement process.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Contract Management</strong> - Many purchases have an underlying contract; being able to track things like renewals, and automatic notifications when renewals come-up keep things simple and organized.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Asset Management</strong> - Having a closed loop process for asset purchases, from purchase requisition and Receiving to CMDB and ERP, and keeping physical assets in-sync with assets on the book, assures compliance and enables scale.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>IT Financial Management</strong> - Gives IT management insight into IT-related finances and costing. It empowers IT.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Product Management Shout Out</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Big thanks to Jacob Gsoedl (VP, IT Business Applications ServiceNow) for helping me get the word out today.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Want to know more?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Financial_Management" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Financial_Management">Financial management</a> is the process of planning, analyzing, directing, and controlling costs.
