What is next when you are formalizing your Performance Analytics processes and procedures?   Well, the only way to prevent having to run a vicious loop of cleaning and cleaning, and scrubbing and cleaning, is to put some quality control in place. </span></p><p></p><h2></h2><h2>Implementing a Change Advisory Board <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">(CAB) </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">for your Performance Analytics environment:</span></h2><p>A Change Advisory board (CAB) is a team of individuals whom, on a regular cadence (weekly/monthly dependent on volume), review new development work and ensure that it meets a stringent set of criteria before approving it to be 'production ready.' This will ensure that corporate standards are met, and there is minimal risk during roll-out.</p><p></p><p>Example CAB responsibilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Widgets or Indicators have not been duplicated. </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">They will be validating that proper process was followed and existing widgets/indicators, etc. will not be duplicated in production.</span></li><li><strong>Indicators sources should not be created where breakdowns can be used. </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">There may be some situations where more detailed conditions need to be applied at the source level. This should always be the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>exception </em></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">and not the standard process, and should be verified before moving to a production environment.</span></li><li><strong>Naming conventions have been followed.</strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Ensure that the proper naming conventions that have been established (per my first blog in the series) have been adhered to. We document our naming conventions at ServiceNow with a Knowledge Base article. </span></li><li><strong>Widget to tab ratio is acceptable. </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">When working with Performance Analytics, there are different types and sized widgets that can be used while developing dashboards. This can make for a very purposeful dashboard... and it can also make for a disaster.   There should be a limit to how many are placed on the tab for both aesthetics and for performance.   Determine what that threshold is and make sure it is properly documented and followed.</span></li><li><strong>Dashboard guidelines are being adhered to. </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Following along the same lines as above, there are certain guidelines for creating dashboards, CAB is the perfect place to catch any dashboards that may be a bit wild and way off the mark.</span></li></ul><p><img   alt="quality control.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="8338fc46dbd89344e9737a9e0f9619df.iix" style="height: 186px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>With a Change Advisory Board, you are going to need means and modes for monitoring these changes and communicating approvals. Utilizing messaging services and social IT you can create a board that is kept up-to-date on development work, bounce ideas off of each other and make sure everything goes according to plan. At ServiceNow, we are planning to use the new capabilities with Knowledge V3 and email to monitor our development environment.</p><p></p><h3>Monitoring Development with Checks &amp; Controls</h3><p>After you have 'cleaned house' it will be important that those appointed to the CAB will monitor additions, updates and changes made to your company's performance analytics environment. Their job will be to ensure quality control and prevent the need to start this process over from the beginning.</p><ul><li><strong>Control reports (duplicate entries, improper labeling, unused items - widgets/indicators)</strong>. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Reports should be put into place to capture errant behavior, this allows better management and will help catch anything that could have possibly slipped through the cracks</span></li><li><strong>Performance Analytics Dashboard</strong>. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Control reports should be put onto a PA Dashboard so they can be easily accessed and monitored</span></li><li><strong>Monthly Purging</strong>. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Based off of above listed standards and dashboards for management, stay on top of it!   Monthly purging will help maintain a clean and controlled environment.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3>Communicating with the PA Change Advisory Board</h3><ul><li><strong>Email aliases for communicating: pa_admins &amp; pa_power users</strong>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Keep everyone on the same page by using email aliases to communicate to each team about specific information, new policies and procedures, etc.</span></li><li><strong>Knowledge Base articles</strong>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Use your knowledge base for documenting any and everything applicable to your PA Management Program such as </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Policies &amp; Procedures, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">CAB Guidelines, meeting dates, team, and </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dashboard Guidelines</span></li></ul><p></p><p>By following the above listed guidelines, you are headed down the right path to having a well managed PA environment with useful dashboards that your management team will happily embrace!</p><p></p><p>If all of this talk of Performance Analytics has you confused about your own reporting, check out our resources so you can implement a PA program at your company.</p><p><a title="How Performance Analytics Can Help Your Business" __default_attr="4015" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="How Performance Analytics Can Help Your Business" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=765c2aa1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96193b">How Performance Analytics Can Help Your Business</a></p><p><a __default_attr="4261" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Performance Analytics for Incident Management" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=db0d6ea5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961907" modifiedtitle="true" title="Performance Analytics for Incident Management">Performance Analytics for Incident Management</a></p><p><a __default_attr="3004" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Performance Analytics: Why daily trending beats monthly reporting" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=996eaeaddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619d3" modifiedtitle="true" title="Performance Analytics: Why daily trending beats monthly reporting">Performance Analytics: Why daily trending beats monthly reporting</a></p><p></p><p>Also, check out the first two blog posts on what we, at ServiceNow, have done to formalize our PA environment process.<a title="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Cleaning House" __default_attr="4229" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Cleaning House" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=4cbce625dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619bf">Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Cleaning House</a> and <a title="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Development Environment" __default_attr="4364" __jive_macro_name="blogpost" class="jive_macro jive_macro_blogpost" data-orig-content="Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Development Environment" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=74dd66e9dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96199b">Performance Analytics at ServiceNow: Development Environment</a>.</p>
