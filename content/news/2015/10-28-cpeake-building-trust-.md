The questionnaires are then made available to every customer under an Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) annually.</p>

<p>as a Service (SaaS) environment.   The questions cover the infrastructure components, the security features within the ServiceNow application, and of course our policies and procedures. The Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) Questionnaire by Shared Assessments has long been a trusted source to ask the relevant questions for todays IT departments, providing updated questions annually. The CSA has become the de-facto standard for the security industry when evaluating security and risk of SaaS solutions through their CSA Consensus Assessments Initiative (CIA) and their CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the questionnaires, third party auditors annually assess the ServiceNow environment, the policies, and procedures against the control set within International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001:2013 standard and Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 16.   Once the assessments are completed, the auditor delivers SSAE16 Attestations to ServiceNow known as Service Organization Controls (SOC) 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 reports.   These reports document from an independent perspective the SaaS environment along with the controls they evaluated. We of course make these available to customers as well!</p>
<p> </p>
