<p>Mobile UI actions and desktop UI actions are two different entities; the key to using <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551379" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551379">mobile UI actions</a> is to first understand the differences between the two interfaces. When using UI actions, here are a couple of things to note:</p><ul><li>The UI actions on your mobile are <em>not</em> the same as what you see on your desktop.</li><li>The UI actions you've created in the desktop UI will <em>not be visible</em> in the mobile UI, and vice versa.</li></ul><p></p><p>Here's where you can find them:</p><ul><li>Desktop UI actions are stored on the [sys_ui_action] table and can be seen by navigating to <strong>System UI &gt; UI Actions</strong>.</li><li>Mobile UI actions are stored on the [sys_ui_ng_action] table and are accessible by navigating to <strong>System Mobile UI &gt; UI Actions - Mobile</strong>.</li></ul><p></p><p><img  alt="Types of UI actions.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="84c68d0adb5497049c9ffb651f9619cc.iix" style="height: 280px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Mobile UI Action Visibility &amp; Locations</h2><p></p><p>In the desktop UI, there's a related list on the UI action form called <strong>UI Action Visibility</strong> that's used to restrict specific views. When using Mobile UI Actions, keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Showing a desktop UI action on the mobile view will <em>not </em>give a desktop UI action visibility in the mobile UI.</li><li>There is <em>no equivalent related list</em> for the <strong>Mobile UI Action</strong> form. This is because the mobile UI does not support multiple views. It will only use the <strong>Mobile view</strong>, and all mobile UI actions will automatically use this<em>.</em></li></ul><p></p><p>As with the desktop UI, <strong>Mobile UI Actions</strong> buttons can appear in different spots when you select the check boxes on the UI Action form. These mobile locations include:</p><ul><li><strong>List</strong> button: The UI Action appears on record lists for the table specified in the <strong>Table</strong> field.</li><li><strong>Form</strong> button: The UI Action appears on forms for records on the table specified in the <strong>Table</strong> field.</li><li><strong>Form more</strong> item: The UI Action appears in the <strong>More</strong> button, which appears as an ellipsis in the lower right corner of the mobile form.</li></ul><p></p><p><img  alt="List buttons.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="aff80542db14130468c1fb651f961962.iix" style="height: 341px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><h2>Mobile UI Actions &amp; Scripting</h2><p></p><p>Again, as with desktop UI Actions, mobile UI actions can contain scripts in both the condition and script fields; however, there are some differences and limitations for client-side scripting for the mobile UI. One change in particular is the difference between <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/user-interface/blog/2015/09/02/mobile-url-navigation">Mobile and Desktop URL structure</a>, which you'll need to know when using actions like <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">action.setRedirect</span>.</p><p></p><p>You can find out more about scripting and mobile UI actions here: <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Mobile_Client_GlideForm_%28g_form%29_Scripting#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Mobile_Client_GlideForm_%28g_form%29_Scripting#gsc.tab=0">Mobile Client GlideForm (gfrom) Scripting</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Need more help with mobile UI issues?</h2><p></p><p><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551387" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551387">KB0551387</a> - The action.setRedirectURL method is not working for Mobile UI actions.
