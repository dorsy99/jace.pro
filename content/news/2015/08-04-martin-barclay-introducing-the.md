<p>There&#39;s a lot great things happening on the ServiceNow Store since the launch at Knowledge15, and we want to make sure you&#39;re up to speed on everything! Fresh Apps is all about the latest and greatest Store news and most importantly, the Store Vendors and Apps that make it such a valuable destination for ServiceNow customers.</p>
<p>The ServiceNow Store is the go-to place for customers to browse, discover, try, and buy certified apps and integrations from the growing ServiceNow ecosystem of Store Vendors. If you&#39;re an enterprise looking to slash app development costs, get more agile in terms of new cloud-native app deployment, and take advantage of innovative apps from 3rd party developers that extend the value and benefits of the ServiceNow Platform and Service Management Suite, the Store has what you&#39;re looking for.</p>
<p>Each episode will feature a new Fresh App and interview with the Store Vendor who will provide further insights into the company, app, the types of customers the app is designed to serve, and the business benefits provided by their app. This gives listeners the next level of information not available through the Store listing alone, straight from the Store Vendors themselves. Fresh Apps also delivers the latest Store news from ServiceNow experts so listeners can get the latest on what&#39;s new for ServiceNow customers as well as for Store Vendors.</p>
<p>We&#39;d like to get your feedback about each episode so we can continue to make Fresh Apps more valuable to you. Please sound off in the comments!</p>
