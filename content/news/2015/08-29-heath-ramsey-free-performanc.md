<p>OK, so you read the article on <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/knowledge-user-conference/knowledge15/network/blog/2015/04/22/free-performance-analytics">setting up the standard version of Performance Analytics</a> on Eureka or Fuji.   You have dutifully followed the steps, but you are having issues with visualizing your data.   Don't get frustrated!   There is a perfectly valid reason why Performance Analytics might not be able to immediately pick up your data . . . and it comes back to the power of the ServiceNow platform.</p><p></p><p>The ServiceNow platform provides you with a framework for some standard IT service management processes including Incident, Problem, Change, and Request (among others).   The applications include some recommended fields for implementing the processes; however, you have the power to configure each application to suit your organization's specific needs.   When you turn on Performance Analytics, though, the product makes some assumptions about where it can find the data to build the trend information--namely those recommended application fields.   If you are using different fields, you just need to configure Performance Analytics to point to those locations.</p><p></p><p>This article provides a common example that may immediately solve your problem by showing you how to change your Indicator Sources to point to the <em>Closed</em> field instead of the <em>Resolved</em> field for the Incident Management indicators.   You should be able to re-use this approach to modify any Indicator Sources you need to find the data you are looking for.   Let's get to work . . .</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Step 1:   Determine the Indicator Sources Requiring Modification</strong></span></p><p></p><p>Before you get started, you should determine which fields contain the data you are looking for.   In our example, the Incident Management process is leveraging the <em>Closed</em> field to determine when an incident is considered resolved.   This is different than the standard <em>Resolved</em> field that Performance Analytics uses by default.</p><p></p><p>Now we can look at the Indicator Sources in Performance Analytics and see which ones need to be adjusted.   In the standard version of Performance Analytics, there are 3 indicator sources:</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Incidents.New:</strong>   This Indicator Source determines which incidents were created on a specific day.   Because this Indicator Source relies only on the <em>Created</em> incident field, no modifications are necessary.</li><li><strong>Incidents.Open:</strong>   This Indicator Source determines which incidents were open on a specific day.   You can only know if an incident was open by looking at the date it was created and the date it was resolved.   Because we need to look at the timestamp for when the incident was resolved, this is an Indicator Source we will need to modify in our example.</li><li><strong>Incidents.Closed:</strong>   This Indicator Source determines which incidents were resolved on a specific day.   You definitely have to look at the resolution timestamp for this data, so this Indicator Source will also need to be modified for our example.</li></ul><p></p><p>We will need to update two (2) Indicator Sources to look at the <em>Closed</em> field instead of the <em>Resolved</em> field.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Step 2:   Update the Incidents.Open Indicator Source</strong></span></p><p></p><p><em>Incidents.Open</em> is the Indicator Source we will modify first.   Use the following steps to update <em>Incidents.Open</em>:</p><p></p><ol><li>In the left-hand navigation pane, click <strong>Performance Analytics &gt; Data Collector &gt; Indicator Sources</strong>.   The list of Indicator Sources appears in the main content pane.</li><li>Click the <strong>Incidents.Open</strong> Indicator Source from the list.   The details page for <em>Incidents.Open</em> appears.</li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>Source</strong> section of the page.</li><li>Under the Conditions area, change the <strong>Resolved is Empty</strong> and <strong>Resolved after Today</strong> conditions to <strong>Closed is Empty</strong> and <strong>Closed after Today</strong>.   Your screen should now look like the screen shot below.<br/><img   alt="incidentsopen.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="3f033779dbdc1fc03eb27a9e0f961942.iix" style="height: 228px;

Data Collector &gt; Indicator Sources</strong>.   The list of Indicator Sources appears in the main content pane.</li><li>Click the <strong>Incidents.Resolved</strong> Indicator Source from the list.   The details page for <em>Incidents.Resolved</em> appears.</li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>Source</strong> section of the page.</li><li>Under the Conditions area, change the <strong>Resolved on</strong><strong> Today</strong> condition to <strong>Closed on</strong><strong> Today</strong>.   Your screen should now look like the screen shot below.<br/><img   alt="incidentsresolved.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="c60a1d8adb18d304b322f4621f961970.iix" style="height: 131px;

Data Collector &gt; Scripts</strong>.   The list of scripts appears in the main content pane.</li><li>Click the <strong>Incident.ResolveTime.Hours</strong> script from the list.   The details for the <em>Incident.ResolveTime.Hours</em> script appears.</li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>Source</strong> section of the page.</li><li>In the Fields area of the Source section, be sure that the <strong>Opened</strong> and <strong>Closed</strong> fields are selected.   Your screen should look like the screen shot below:<br/><img   alt="scriptsource.png" class="jive-image image-2" src="f8921c86dbd05304b322f4621f9619d8.iix" style="height: 100px; width: 620px;"/></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>Script</strong> section of the page.</li><li>In line 3 of the script, replace <strong>current.resolved_at</strong> with <strong>current.closed_at</strong>.   Your screen should look like the screen shot below:<br/><img   alt="scriptclosed.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="2603b80edbd8dfc068c1fb651f9619f7.iix" style="height: 175px;
