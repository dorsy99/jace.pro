<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">If you're already planning your trip to <a title="owledge.servicenow.com/" href="http://knowledge.servicenow.com/">Knowledge15</a>, congratulations. I'm envious. (I'm also available, if someone wants to hire me to present or consult at said event. Yes, I'm serious.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">If you're absolutely sure you're not going to Knowledge15, my condolences. I am absolutely convinced you're going to miss something really great. Probably several really great things. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">If you're not yet sure you're going to Knowledge15, if it's at all possible, stop wavering and wondering, register, and go. It will be worth it, to your team, your organization, and to you personally. If you doubt this, ask anyone who's gone to previous Knowledge conferences. Anyone. Within the ServiceNow Community or elsewhere. If you find any ServiceNow user who says their Knowledge experience was not worthwhile, I will be abjectly shocked. And I've been around IT people for 35 years and some change now, so I don't shock easily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">I no longer work at ServiceNow, nor at Intréis, the ServiceNow Authorized Solutions Provider at which I had the honor and pleasure to serve as Director of Marketing until ServiceNow acquired Intréis. So I have nothing to gain professionally or personally by encouraging you to attend Knowledge15. But that's precisely what I'm doing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">The Knowledge event is the best, most user-centric, most highly user-powered IT industry event I've ever seen or gotten to enjoy in person. And ServiceNow and its partners have some of the smartest, most engaged, most passionate users (and employees) I've met in my entire career.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Spending a few days in such rich company can only do you good, personally and professionally. And with the addition of CreatorCon and a focus on "Everything as a Service," Knowledge15 is very likely to jump-start and accelerate a lot of exciting, valuable ServiceNow projects at a lot of enterprises. Maybe even yours.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">For more incentive to go to Knowledge15, check out my post-Knowledge14 post, "<a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=1c5de229dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619dd">IT and Enterprise Transformation 101: The Knowledge Effect</a>."
