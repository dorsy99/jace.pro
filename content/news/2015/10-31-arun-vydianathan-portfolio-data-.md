<p style="text-align: justify;">[X-Post from <a __default_attr="207131" __jive_macro_name="thread" class="jive_macro_thread jive_macro" data-orig-content="Portfolio Data Model" data-renderedposition="10_90.7119140625_149_16" href="/community?id=community_question&sys_id=f4709b29dbdcdbc01dcaf3231f96198c" modifiedtitle="true" title="Portfolio Data Model">Portfolio Data Model</a>]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This article explains Portfolio data model and how portfolio gets associated to demands and projects. A portfolio is basically collection of related projects and demands. Demands were included part of portfolio starting from Fuji Release.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Demands are associated to Portfolio in a simple 1:m relation (i.e. 1 portfolio can have m demands).</p><p><img  __jive_id="34054" alt="d2p.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="3171dc8adb949704ed6af3231f961943.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to Project the relation between portfolio and project becomes little complex. First we need to understand two different tables - "<strong>Portfolio Projects</strong>" and "<strong>Portfolio Status</strong>".</p><p></p><p><strong>Portfolio Projects</strong> or Project View table <span style="color: #262626;">is associated with a project record and holds the same data as the project, such as the planned start and end dates, with some additional information related to milestones, risks, issues and goals for corresponding project. This data is basically used for reporting purposes to add views to the portfolio dashboard. Any updates to the Project propagate to the Portfolio Project as well.</span> A project record can have many portfolio project records.</p><p></p><p><strong>Portfolio Status</strong> is a many-to-many relationship table between Portfolio Projects and Portfolio table.</p><p>Project is related to Portfolio through the Portfolio Projects and Portfolio Status tables as shown in the diagram below.</p><p></p><p><img  __jive_id="34055" alt="pm2mp.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="03d07f39db18df04e9737a9e0f961958.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #262626;">Starting with Fuji — we support a simplified association between Project and Portfolio. A new column has been added in project table — primary_portfolio through which you can associate a project to a portfolio by simply populating the field in the project record. This way of usage supports 1:m relation between portfolio and project.</span></p><p></p><p><img  __jive_id="34059" alt="p2p.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="9caec502db589f048c8ef4621f961919.iix" style="height: auto;"/></p><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #262626;">To summarize here are the ways to associate project and portfolio</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #262626;"><strong>Starting with Fuji - </strong></span><span style="color: #262626;">In the project form you can enter the primary_portfolio field with relevant portfolio you want to associate the project with. This method can be used only if you want to have a 1:m relation between portfolio and project.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #262626;"><strong>Fuji and prior - </strong></span><span style="color: #262626;">When you create a project, a portfolio project record automatically gets created. And the portfolio project record needs to be associated to the portfolio. For this do the following</span></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><span style="color: #262626;">Open the Portfolio record</span></li><li><span style="color: #262626;">On the <strong>Project view</strong> related list, click <strong>Edit</strong>, and add the project (note by this you are associating the portfolio project with the portfolio)</span></li></ol><p></p><p>Note: Project view related list doesn't appear you can configure Related list and bring in the related list.</p><p>Starting with Fuji Portfolio record has two related list added - Demand and Project. Project view related list is hidden, but due to prior customizations if it appears you can hide it by going to Configure -&gt; Related Lists option</p><p></p><p><strong>Projects not appearing in CIO Roadmap</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #262626;">We have seen many customer questions around projects not appearing or missing in CIO Roadmap. This is mostly caused by data issues where the project and portfolio are not related through the portfolio status table. Make sure that the projects have a proper "Portfolio Project" record created and the "Portfolio Project" record is associated to the portfolio through the "Portfolio Status" table. If the association of project and portfolio is proper through the "Portfolio Status" table then projects would appear in CIO Roadmap.</span></p>
