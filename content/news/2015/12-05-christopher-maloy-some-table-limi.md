<p>It is often a design decision to normalize data into multiple lookup tables and create reference fields for that data. Â  Do take note and caution when doing this that there are limits on the number of Indexes and Columns that can be created on a single table (and if you are extending a table like Task then realize that some indexes and columns are already being used up and or get used up in the flattening process).</p><p></p><p>Reference fields are indexed and can push you closer to the upper limit of 64 indexes (indices?).</p><p></p><p>What I am trying to say is that it is a good design practice to control your reference fields. <span __jive_emoticon_name="happy" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="134_569.390625_16_16" src="/8.0.1.35b65d4/images/emoticons/happy.png"></span></p><p></p><p><a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Fields#gsc.tab=0" title="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Fields#gsc.tab=0">Introduction to Fields - ServiceNow Wiki</a></p><p><a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Tables_and_Columns_Module#gsc.tab=0" title="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Tables_and_Columns_Module#gsc.tab=0">Tables and Columns Module - ServiceNow Wik</a></p>
