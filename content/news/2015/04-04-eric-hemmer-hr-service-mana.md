<p>I am fortunate to work with our most ambitious HR customers and see how they continuously raise the bar of customer service.   It's natural to strive for better customer satisfaction when you simply like to please people, but what are the tangible benefits?   If you provide better service, you will transform your workplace - improving the culture, the loyalty, the retention.   Your customers (a.k.a. employees) will become more self-reliance when presented with an easy and quick way to find answers to their questions.   This frees HR to transform from a cost center into a value center; one that has time to focus on attracting top talent, developing employees, retaining leaders, and optimizing your process to improve your organization's bottom line.   Align your goals to support those of your enterprise.</p><p></p><p>In these series of blog posts, I will discuss many ways in which I see our most brilliant customers adding value through continuous service improvement.</p><p></p><p><strong>#1 - The Service Experience</strong></p><p>It should not surprise you that creating an attractive and intuitive portal and mobile interface are key to engaging and empowering your customers.   Take advantage of our content management system (CMS) to brand your portal and project a sense of culture.   Keep it simple and personalize the content using <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=User_Criteria" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=User_Criteria">User Criteria</a> and <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Contextual_Search" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Contextual_Search">Contextual Search</a>, so employees only see articles, policies, news, and catalog items that are relevant to them based on any profile factor: location, business unit, job level, etc...   This will drive adoption and reduce the number of routine, repetitive questions your agents must field.   We've had customers reduce the amount of routine work their agents handle from 80% of their workload down to 20% of their workload!!!   That's like getting and extra 3 days a week to focus on more strategic stuff.   I could use an extra 3 days, especially now that I am blogging.   <span __jive_emoticon_name="happy" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_emote jive_macro" data-renderedposition="281_883.203125_16_16" src="/images/emoticons/happy.gif"></span>   How about you?</p><p></p><p>Below are a couple examples of customer portals.</p><p><img   alt="Christus Health Combined.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="55a040cadb58d3041dcaf3231f96190a.iix" style="height: 670px; width: 620px;"/></p><p><img   alt="Envision Healthcare.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="01e2a9cedb9c13043eb27a9e0f9619b0.iix" style="height: 359px; width: 620px;"/></p><p><img   alt="Starwood Suites.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="6e310d82dbd01b04ed6af3231f961917.iix" style="height: 313px; width: 620px;"/></p>
