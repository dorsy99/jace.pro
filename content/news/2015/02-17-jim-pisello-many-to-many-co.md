<p>Recently I had a requirement from a client to create a list view that would only display task records appropriate to members of certain groups. The functionality was similar to the standard <strong>My Groups Work</strong> module, which uses the getMyGroups() function to return an array of group Sys IDs representing all of the user's group memberships. However, unlike the <span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"><strong>My Groups Work</strong></span><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"> module,</span> the groups on my client's task records were contained in a custom List field on the record rather than a reference field.</p><p></p><p>The <span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"><strong>My Groups Work</strong></span><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"> module compares the value in the task's <strong>Assignment group</strong> field with the user's group memberships by using the <strong>is</strong> operator:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"><img   alt="ServiceNow_MyGroupsWorkFilter.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="efd7340adb5cdfc068c1fb651f961996.iix" style="height: 151px; width: 620px;"/><br/></span></p><p>This works fine for comparing a single value from the <strong>Assignment group</strong> field to the array of groups returned by the <strong>getMyGroups()</strong> function. But what about a many-to-many comparison between the groups in my client's custom list field and the user's groups?</p><p></p><p>I could have written a custom function in a client-callable Script Include to return a list of group Sys IDs, but the answer turns out to be much simpler, and best of all, it's right in front of us. The <strong>contains</strong> operator will automatically perform a comparison between multiple values on each side of the condition, and if any matches are found the condition evaluates to <em>true</em>.</p><p><img   alt="ServiceNow_contains_filter.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="4039948adb989fc068c1fb651f96194e.iix" style="height: 75px; width: 620px;"/></p><p></p><p>So, the next time you need to compare multiple values to each other, try using the <strong>contains</strong> operator in your list or other filter condition.</p>
