<p><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit;">Customers are continually driving the ServiceNow platform into new areas of the business, modernizing and transforming the way in which work is being requested, fulfilled and measured. I have seen first hand many of the innovative ways in which problems are being solved, through a common platform and series of solutions and/or functionality. Boiling down the problem and re-constructing it as a modern rich and intuitive experience is allowing organizations to move quicker, scale faster and deliver services like never before.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit;">I am incredibly proud to be part of an upcoming event with our partner and customer, Suncorp. On November 9th we are unleashing some of the brightest and best in an all day Hackathon. The goal is to build meaningful, innovative applications/solutions that solve problems that customers have today and are difficult using existing solutions and platforms.   The team at SunCorp are all in, we have 3 locations in Australia participating. There will be live blogging, tweeting and video interviews throughout the day, so watch for updates, we will be on Twitter using #HackNow.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit;">If you want to hold similar events to drive innovation and create a step change in your organization to think about solving problems in a different but simple way, then let us know.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit; color: #000000;">The days of using legacy client/server and soviet era software are gone…<span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: inherit; color: #ff0000;"><strong style="font-style: inherit; font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: inherit;">What are you doing to drive transformation?</strong></span></span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit;">Next update from Brisbane, it's going to be a blast.</span></p>
