Eclipse vs. IntelliJ, or Vim vs. Emacs are just a couple of the common topics that can be cause for fiery debate. More recently, I've seen a lot of similar discussions on the tools used for </span><a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management" style="font-family: Arial; text-indent: 0.5in; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">source code management</a><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-family: Arial; text-indent: 0.5in; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> and </span><a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" style="font-family: Arial; text-indent: 0.5in; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">versioning</a><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-family: Arial; text-indent: 0.5in; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">. As a fairly recent graduate, I feel pretty well indoctrinated into the Church of Git, and consider all other systems to be blasphemous. However, the more I work in the enterprise space, I've found that while some of the open source, distributed version control systems are wonderful to use as a single developer, when working within a larger team or company there's typically need for a version control system such as Perforce or Visual Studio that is more capable of meeting the compliance, auditing, and security needs of a larger enterprise. Often these software code management tools work in conjunction with a version control system such as Git or Subversion, but provide an additional layer on top of the versioning system to track commit history, enforce file permissions, and provide audit trails for each and every interaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0d0d0d;">                       As much as possible, I try to find my answers in data. However, as surprising as it might seem, the available data on what source control software developers are using in medium to large companies is quite sparse. This is especially true when trying to find current data on the compliance needs of source control software within enterprise or B2B companies. Even though I initially wince at the thought of taking a customer survey, now that I'm on the other side as a product manager, I've come to realize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just how valuable and vital direct user feedback is.</span></span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-family: Arial;">In thinking about enhancements, integrations, and new products, there's nothing more important than talking to our customers directly. Not only can we be sure that what we're building will be of use, but your input helps shape the product in a huge way from overall look and feel to the specifics of how a feature is implemented. As a product manager, understanding the needs of our customers is my top priority, which is why I need your help. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: .5in; background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0d0d0d;">To that end, I hope you find time to provide your input and take a short 3-question survey. No long essays, or complicated choice matrixes, just 3 simple multiple-choice questions. If you would be so kind, I've made a <a href="https://s.zoomerang.com/s/WJXK5ZT"><strong>super easy SurveyMonkey survey</strong></a> to take. You can see a picture of the survey below, which doubles as a link when you click on it. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: .5in; background: white;">                                                           <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0d0d0d;"><a href="https://s.zoomerang.com/s/WJXK5ZT"><img   alt="community survey picture.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="582" src="d9251486dbd05344e9737a9e0f96198e.iix" style="height: 581.694915254237px; width: 385px;" width="385"/></a><br/></span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: .5in; background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0d0d0d;">Feel free to comment on this blog post with any questions regarding the survey, or source control in general.
