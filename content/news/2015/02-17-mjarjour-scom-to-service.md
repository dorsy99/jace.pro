It allows for a seamless and quick integration with ServiceNow through the Evanios Operations or Evanios Integration solution.</p><p></p><p>At the demand of our customers, the SCOM to ServiceNow integration package has been enhanced to map additional SCOM fields (i.e. SCOM Management Pack Name; for a complete list of the SCOM fields that are automatically mapped, please look at the <a title="w.evanios.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Microsoft_SCOM_Packaged_Integration#SCOM_Events_Table" href="http://www.evanios.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Microsoft_SCOM_Packaged_Integration#SCOM_Events_Table">Evanios Documentation</a>). In addition to mapping new fields, the new version will provide additional flexibility in how custom fields from specific SCOM management packs can be extracted.</p><p></p><p>The following diagram describes the basic flow of an alert from SCOM to the on-premise Evanios Agent and onto the Evanios Operations/Integration application running within ServiceNow :</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.evanios.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SCOM-V2.jpg"><img alt="SCOM-V2" class="wp-image-2061 size-full alignnone jiveImage" height="396" src="http://www.evanios.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SCOM-V2.jpg" style="width: 709px; height: 395.502px;" width="709"/></a></p><p></p><p>In this new and enhanced version, the integration script will look-up yet more details about the alert from the new alert_properties.conf file, such as parameter name, parameter value, instance, target, origin and context.
