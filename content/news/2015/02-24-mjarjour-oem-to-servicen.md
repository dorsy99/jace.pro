It collects events from all your monitoring solutions and acts as a "manager of managers". From a single pane of glass you get an overall view of your IT environment. Events can be de-duplicated, correlated, and acted upon.</p><p>Our Event Management solution is a ServiceNow application which has the benefit of being able to leverage ITSM data from other applications. The response to an event can be changed based on its definition the CMDB, or what business services it might impact. The response can be handled differently if you are in the middle of an active scheduled change.
