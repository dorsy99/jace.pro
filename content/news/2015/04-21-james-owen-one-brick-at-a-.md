Most individuals start their new company, product, or service with agility in mind. Time to market is a top priority â€” Process that increases lead time is minimized.</p><p></p><p>Then a mistake happens and a brick gets mortared in. Dev gives Ops a bad build. Ops upgrades a server that accidentally impacts a critical business service. New site content makes it all the way to Test, but is skipped in a manual deployment step to production.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="230" style="border: none; width: 655px; height: 184px;"><tbody><tr><td style="padding: 0px 5.4pt; text-align: center;" valign="top" width="221"><p><img   alt="BangHead.jpeg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="190" src="9821950edbd413043eb27a9e0f9619d0.iix" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em; height: 190px; width: 141.97802197802199px;" width="142"/></p></td><td style="padding: 0 5.4pt 0 5.4pt;" valign="top" width="221"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Often the mistakes are embarrassing, but sometimes they can be disasterous.</p><p></p><p>Pretty soon more insults than bits are hurled over the wall and <strong>heads start banging.</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="188" style="border: none; width: 658px; height: 188px;"><tbody><tr><td style="padding: 0 5.4pt 0 5.4pt;" valign="top" width="221"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Everyone recognizes the wall needs to come down, but like the <a title="nchestermysteryhouse.com/thehouse.cfm" href="http://winchestermysteryhouse.com/thehouse.cfm">Winchester Mystery House</a>, understanding why some of the bricks are there and how to remove them can be baffling.</p></td><td style="padding: 0px 5.4pt; text-align: center;" valign="top" width="221"><a href="http://winchestermysteryhouse.com/thehouse.cfm"><img   alt="thehouse.jpg" class="jive-image image-2" src="a3de2c46db949344e9737a9e0f961954.iix" style="height: auto;"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="182" style="border: none; width: 660px; height: 182px;"><tbody><tr><td style="padding: 0 5.4pt 0 5.4pt;" valign="top" width="221"><p></p><p>At ServiceNow, we're on a mission to help DevOps teams remove bricks from the walls and better enable agility with governance.
