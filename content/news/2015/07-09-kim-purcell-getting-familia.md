<p>ServiceNow Fuji users are getting pretty familiar with <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Migrating_to_Knowledge_Management_v3#Overview" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Migrating_to_Knowledge_Management_v3#Overview">Knowledge Management v3.</a> Knowledge v3 is the latest version of Knowledge Management enabled by default for all instances starting with the Fuji release.</p><p></p><p><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/knowledge-management/blog/2015/05/04/knowledge-v3-is-here">Knowledge v3 has several key differences from its v2 cousin</a>, which was released in Eureka. Instead of one knowledge base for all of your articles, you can now create multiple knowledge bases for your teams. Better yet, instead of a single publishing workflow to manage your way from article creation to publication, you can now create separate, customizable workflows for each of your knowledge bases. The former two-level category structure is now organized by category and subcategory, allowing you to create any number of levels you'd like for each of your knowledge bases â€” meaning, each of your knowledge bases can have a unique category structure of its own.</p><p></p><p>(Note: When you are in Eureka or earlier, you'll need to <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Migrating_to_Knowledge_Management_v3#Migrating_Knowledge_Functionality" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Migrating_to_Knowledge_Management_v3#Migrating_Knowledge_Functionality">migrate legacy knowledge content and customizations</a> in the Knowledge Base application to take advantage of the latest functionality.</p><p></p><p>To help you make the most of your v3 experience, here are three helpful tips for managing Knowledge v3:</p><p></p><h2>Tip #1 - How to correct knowledge modules in v3:</h2><p>When you upgrade to Knowledge v3, you may notice that the modules <strong>Self-Service &gt; Knowledge</strong> and <strong>Service Desk &gt; Knowledge</strong> point to the knowledge_home_launcher.do page instead of kb_home.do. These modules should not be changed when upgrading to Knowledge v3.</p><p></p><p>To fix the knowledge module:</p><ol><li>Right-click on the module favorite icon in the application navigator.</li><li>Select <strong>Edit</strong> module.</li><li>In the <strong>Link type</strong> tab, change the <strong>Arguments</strong> field value from <strong>knowledge_home_launcher.do</strong> to <strong>kb_home.do</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Update.</strong></li></ol><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-08 at 3.21.35 PM.JPG" class="image-1 jive-image" src="2884b3fddb5cdfc0b322f4621f9619f6.iix" style="height: 294px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: #BDBDBD 4px solid; border-radius: 15px;"/></p><p><strong><br/></strong>In the legacy knowledge base, your article state was controlled by UI actions. With knowledge v3, your article state is controlled by workflows. If you encounter workflow issues like the ones below, follow tips #2 and #3 to get your workflows back on track.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>See <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550089" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550089">Upgrading to Knowledge v3 changes the modules Self-Service &gt; Knowledge and Service Desk &gt; Knowledge to point to the knowledge_home_launcher.do page instead of kb_home.do.</a> for more information.</em></p><p></p><h2>Tip #2 - How to correct duplicate workflow states in Knowledge v3:</h2><p>When you click <strong>Publish</strong> or <strong>Retire</strong> in your article, you may see four identical workflow state entries that show up in your activity log. To fix, you can disable the email notifications that are fired when the article status changes, and remove the <strong>Workflow, State</strong>, <strong>Publish</strong>, and <strong>Retire</strong> fields from the activity formatter.</p><p><img   alt="screen1_Activity_log_multiple_entries.jpg" class="jive-image image-3" src="a6cb554adb1cd344e9737a9e0f961912.iix" style="height: 274px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: #BDBDBD 4px solid; border-radius: 15px;"/></p><p></p><p>To change the status on the activity formatter:</p><ul><ol><li>Open the filter by clicking the filter icon (<a class="image" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=File:Show_hide_activity_filters_UI15.png"><img alt="Show hide activity filters UI15.png" class="jiveImage" height="18" src="http://wiki.servicenow.com/images/5/56/Show_hide_activity_filters_UI15.png" width="20"/></a>) in the <strong>Activity</strong> header.</li><li>Select the fields to display activity.</li><li>Click the filter icon to close.</li></ol></ul><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>See <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549942" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0549942">ServiceNow KB: Publishing and Retire Knowledge UI actions create duplicate Workflow State log entries (KB0549942)</a> for more information</em></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Tip #3 - How to correct 'Rollback To' activity in approval workflows in Knowledge v3:</h2><p>You may also encounter that your approval workflow is re-requesting ALL approvals during the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Designing_Workflows_with_Rollback_To#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Designing_Workflows_with_Rollback_To#gsc.tab=0">Rollback To</a> activity. For example, if your first-level approval is approved but your second-level approval is rejected, ALL approval levels are set back to the <strong>Requested</strong> state, despite the fact that your first level was approved. This can be caused by the Set Value activity or if the Approval Engine is on. To correct this, you can:</p><ul><li>Remove the <strong>Set Value</strong> activity. The Rollback To activity resets the necessary approvals.</li><li>Turn off approval engines if workflows are being used to manage approvals:<ol><li>Go to <strong>System Properties &gt; Approval Engine</strong>. Make the necessary changes.
