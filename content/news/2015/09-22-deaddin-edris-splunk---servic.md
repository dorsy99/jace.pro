<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">It is common today for an IT environment to generate terabytes of data per day. And often times, this poses a huge challenge for datacenter operators — it's hard to tell what's important and what's not. You could have an application outage, a customer service issue or a security breach. And while the answer is in the data, sifting through high volumes of disparate, disconnected data is time consuming, difficult and paralyzing. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you're presented with the right information and intelligence at the right time, it aids with resolving incidents quickly and improves productivity. So, how do you achieve this? By bringing together two IT powerhouse solutions, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="http://www.splunk.com/" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Splunk</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> <span style="color: #000000;">and</span> </span><a href="http://www.servicenow.com/" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">ServiceNow</span></a></span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span> </span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Here's how:</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Splunk, a platform for </span><a href="http://www.splunk.com/content/splunkcom/en_us/resources/machine-data.html"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">machine data</span></a><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">, makes it easy to collect data from any source, from anywhere. It provides you with the ability to search, correlate, analyze, visualize and act upon the data. Most importantly Splunk can act as a correlation engine, evaluating hundreds of events across technology silos and reflecting them into a single event. </span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">ServiceNow Event and Incident Management enables you to capture IT events and streamlines incident workflows and the process for restoring service. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Many of you already use Splunk and ServiceNow independently. When you combine the two solutions, you can blend and correlate machine data to generate highly qualified information from Splunk into ServiceNow. You can use the search results from Splunk to create a single event or directly create an incident into ServiceNow. Once in ServiceNow's Event Management system, you can enrich that event, create an incident and/or initiate incident workflows.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">How does this help you? It helps prevent a event storms, and instead allows you to focus on the issues that truly matter; you enable your teams to take immediate action and resolve incidents quickly, and lastly, you are empowered with the right data and visibility to build efficient incident workflows and operations.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Splunk and ServiceNow have worked together to enable this with the Splunk App for ServiceNow, available on the </span><a href="https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/application/bac6db564f6a3100a0fc7d2ca310c721"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">ServiceNow</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> <span style="color: #000000;">Store and</span> </span><a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1770/"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Splunkbase</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">It's free and easy to get started.
