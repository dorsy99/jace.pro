<p>The Fuji release brings with it an enhanced reporting experience with a number of changes particularly related to report sharing and security. One downside of this is that some customers have found that following an upgrade to Fuji, their users have lost the ability to <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Generating_Reports#Viewing_the_Reports_List" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Generating_Reports#Viewing_the_Reports_List">view all of the reports</a> that are shared with them. Luckily, a quick and easy fix is available for this issue that should ideally be implemented during the<strong> test phase of your upgrade to Fuji or later versions.</strong></p><p></p><p>When a non-admin user accesses the new reporting home page and views certain reports under the Group tab they are seeing the following message: <em>"Number of rows removed from this list by Security Constraints: [Number of reports]"</em></p><p></p><p><img   alt="fuji reporting error.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" src="96e1490adbd09f048c8ef4621f961902.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 170px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">See <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550569" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550569">Reports no longer visible after upgrading to Fuji due to security constraints (KB0550569)</a> for more information.</p><p></p><p>If the report has been saved as a gauge and is displayed on an itil homepage then you could also see this message:</p><p><em>"Report visible only to a specific user or group."</em></p><p></p><p><img   alt="report visible error message.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="04606486dbdc9fc068c1fb651f96193d.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 75px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;">See <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0546694" title="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0546694">ServiceNow KB: Reports list access regulated by ACLs in Fuji release (KB0546694)</a> for more information.<strong><br/></strong></p><p></p><p>The reason for these constraint messages is due to changes in reporting security with the Fuji release. The issue can be resolved by <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Administering_Reports#Report_Security" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Administering_Reports#Report_Security">activating the Report Security - enforce access control checks</a> plugin. This is safe to activate before or after the upgrade to Fuji has been completed.</p>
