<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666; text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: inherit;"><img   alt="store_icons_K15.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="eef8c50adb949f048c8ef4621f961940.iix" style="height: 266px; width: 620px;"/><br/></span></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: inherit;"><br/></span></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">On</span> September 17th-18th at ServiceNow headquarters in Santa Clara, we are holding the first Store Summit, exclusively for Store partners on an invitation-only basis. With well over 100 apps from over 80 partners across 15 industries and 14 solution categories, Store is experiencing tremendous growth since launch at Knowledge15.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The diversity and increasing pace of growth of the available apps and integrations on Store demonstrates the increasing value of the ServiceNow partner ecosystem and their apps that extend the value of the ServiceNow Enterprise Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS) for ServiceNow customers. As more and more use cases are created and business problems are solved with combined ServiceNow - partner solutions, customers are realizing the benefits of Store. Customer are able to make buy versus build and cloud vs on-premise app development and deployment decisions, decreasing time to value and increasing IT/app delivery agility. This is increasingly important to IT, line of business, and departments at ServiceNow customers.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Within IT, IT Service Management and IT Operations teams are looking for value-added certified applications and integrations which can further enhance their ServiceNow implementations. IT organizations face constant pressure to deliver new and updated enterprise applications and integrations to meet their own needs as well as the needs of their lines-of-business and departmental partners. Across the enterprise, app development and deployment teams in line of business, departments, and cloud computing organizations are looking for new, cloud-native 3rd party enterprise applications which can help to enhance their employee's productivity, efficiencies, and effectiveness. ServiceNow Store helps them to meet those business needs.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The rapid rise of public cloud-based enterprise SaaS applications available to line of business and departments means that IT and app dev organizations are challenged to keep up. They are faced with the important choices of buy vs build and customization vs innovation. If the decision is to build in-house, industry research indicates an outcome <span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit; background-position: initial;">which yields higher-levels of customized applications, but a slower time-to-value and higher costs for development and operations. Building applications in-house can be limiting in terms of diversity of choice and ability to take advantage of new innovations.   But it's not an either-or proposition. Most IT organizations will take advantage of both build and buy options. <span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-family: inherit; background-position: initial;">Taking advantage of a growing enterprise application marketplace with a diverse and innovative range of certified, ready-to-deploy enterprise SaaS applications is an option all IT and app dev organizations must consider in today's fast changing and competitive business environment. </span></span></span><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The growth in both the range of certified apps and integrations available on Store, combined with the increasing levels of procurement by ServiceNow customers, is proving this out in the real world.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The ServiceNow Store also brings some less obvious benefits to the table for our Store partners. For example, in many cases, supplier agreements with large and sophisticated enterprises with stringent requirements are cumbersome and difficult to execute for all but the largest ISVs. By publishing on Store, ISVs of all sizes can more easily transact with the install base of ServiceNow customers and accelerate sales.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We are super excited about the first Store Summit and taking a a day and a half deep dive on all things Store with our partners. We congratulate and thank them for recognizing the opportunity and taking the initiative to be early movers onto the Store -   they have been instrumental in driving this incredible growth.   We look forward to meeting with them in person next week.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you're a customer who's tried or bought an app on Store, or if you're a Store partner who's sold an app or generated a lead on Store,   we would welcome your feedback on how Store helped your business and what we can do to improve your experience and make Store even more effective for you.</span></p>
