<p>The <strong>Time Ago</strong> format is a new <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547385" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547385">UI feature of Fuji</a> that makes reviewing incidents in a related list quicker and easier to access. The "Time Ago" feature can be used anywhere a date/time format is used in ServiceNow. "Time Ago" is one of three ways to represent date and time when reviewing data in your instance. You can set the date/time for "Time Ago," "Calendar date" or even both. A fourth option, "Compact list date/time" is also available and does not show date values for the current year or seconds for the time (does not work if "Time Ago" is enabled).</p><p></p><p>The "Time Ago" feature allows you to view dates as "6 days ago" or "31 minutes ago." Rather than telling you when the incident was submitted, it will tell you how much time has passed. This gives you a quick look at how long it has been since a user has been helped. Sorting by "Time Ago" allows you to easily see what issues need to be prioritized based on how long ago it was submitted</p><p></p><p><img  alt="INT box.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="376c3b79db94d3049c9ffb651f9619b4.iix" style="height: 278px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>If you are on Eureka or a version prior to Fuji Patch 5, you may be experiencing a problem with setting your date/time to "time ago" or "both" in related lists to the correct time. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">This error is occurring because the "Time ago" option is calculated based on your system's current time. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">You can fix this problem by changing your </span><a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Time_Zones#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Time_Zones#gsc.tab=0" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">system's time zone</a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> to match the ServiceNow profile time zone.</span></p><p></p><h3>To change your ServiceNow System timezone:</h3><ol><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>System Properties &gt; System</strong>.</li><li>Locate the property called <strong>System timezone.</strong></li><li>Type a time zone in the field and click <strong>Save</strong>.
