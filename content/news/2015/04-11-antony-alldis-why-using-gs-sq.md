<p>There are a number of posts on the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/search.jspa?q=&quot;gs.sql&quot;">Community Site that are referring to the use of an undocumented function called: </a><strong><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/search.jspa?q=&quot;gs.sql&quot;">gs.sql</a>. </strong>This is an UNDOCUMENTED feature and should NOT be used under any circumstances. Most likely if ServiceNow does not document a function it is because it A) ServiceNow does not support its use B) can not offer support for it if it is used and C) ServiceNow does not want to encourage use of it.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="SERVICENOW GS.SQL.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="139" src="04f5a00adb5457049c9ffb651f961956.iix" style="height: 139px; width: 241.739130434783px; float: left;" width="241"/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As an example, I saw that one customer on the community was suggested to use the gs.sql function to truncate a database table. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Truncating tables is an extremely </span><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DANGEROUS</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> process.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Why the use of gs.sql is not supported by ServiceNow when truncating tables:</p><ul><li>If any record elsewhere in the database, references any record in the table that you are truncating, you will potentially "break" your instance.</li><li>Could result in orphan ("ghost") records in the database, or potentially cause an outage!</li></ul><p></p><p>Due to the way that ServiceNow relates tables, when using the recommended methods, we carry out a cascade delete, which removes records <strong>correctly</strong>.<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">This is just one scenario where the use of this function should be avoided at all costs.</span></p><p></p><p>There are always ways of achieving your requirements within the product and information for how to carry these out are available in our product documentation.</p><p></p><h2><a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Deleting_a_Table" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Deleting_a_Table">To properly delete a custom table:</a></h2><ol><li>Navigate to <strong>System Definition &gt; Tables</strong>.</li><li>Open the table to delete.
