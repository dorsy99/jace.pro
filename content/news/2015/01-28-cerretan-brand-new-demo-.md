<p>For existing customers looking to get some information on applications you're curious on (how do you build out a Facilities Catalog?, Can Demand Management help with ROI? etc.) we just introduced today the ServiceNow Demo Center.   This is a demo center where there is a set calendar for 2 months out covering ALL SORTS of topics.   As far as I know, this is an asset that you access through your account executive, he/she gets you registered and you're good to go.   I am thinking of a way to publicize the schedule without spamming my customers.   This looks like a great resource though.   Let me know if you'd like the calendar.</p>
