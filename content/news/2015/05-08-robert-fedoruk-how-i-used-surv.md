<p><strong>PREVIOUS EPISODES</strong></p><p>For those just joining us, this blog follows my adventures in using ServiceNow surveys to build project engagement and extract actionable info from project participants where-ever possible.</p><p><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/general/blog/2015/05/06/how-i-used-surveys-to-drive-project-engagement--p1">Episode 1</a></p><p><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-management/general/blog/2015/05/06/how-i-used-surveys-to-drive-project-engagement--p2">Episode 2</a></p><p></p><h1><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>EPISODE 3 - WHAT DID THE KOOLAID TASTE LIKE?</strong></span></h1><p>We'll skip the <span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">Survey <span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">building </span></span>experienceand move straight to the results.   After our preview session we showed the Survey, which was a great way to introduce attendees to ServiceNow's Survey capability. <span __jive_emoticon_name="wink" __jive_macro_name="emoticon" class="jive_macro jive_emote" src="/6.0.3.0/images/emoticons/wink.png"></span>   Of 12 attendees, 4 responded (so far).   Anything useful?   Lets see current results based off categories we defined back in Episode 2.</p><p></p><p><strong>CATEGORY 1 - OVERALL FEELING</strong></p><p>Based on my preview of the ServiceNow tool, how did people generally feel about the project?   Universally positive!   That's a good thing.</p><p><img   alt="SurveyResult-Overall.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="307" src="9b2e8c06db909fc03eb27a9e0f9619ce.iix" style="height: 307px; width: 343.574007220217px;" width="344"/></p><p></p><p><strong>CATEGORY 2 - ARE WE GETTING IT RIGHT?</strong></p><p>We had 4 key design goals for the implementation and we asked users how they felt about the direction of each.   Possible answers: good, bad, and neutral.   Good news: Nobody thought we were trending worse on the key design areas.   We also see that our automation / orchestration efforts need more visibility, or at least need to extend to other teams.</p><p><img   alt="SurveyResult-GettingRight.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="374" src="73527f71dbdc1fc03eb27a9e0f961906.iix" style="height: 373.698387096774px; width: 413px;" width="413"/></p><p></p><p><strong>CATEGORY 3 - FEATURE FEEDBACK</strong></p><p>We demonstrated many features that differentiated ServiceNow from the incumbent tool.   We wanted to find out which resonated the strongest so we could develop better training and cultural integration materials.   Here we see everyone loved Collaboration, Email (or rather, communication within SN via Additional Comments and watch list), and Workflow.   Most people were interested in contextual search and our custom self-service interface.   Surprisingly (and in contrast to earlier assumptions), nobody cared about time logging.</p><p><img   alt="SurveyResult-Topics.png" class="jive-image image-2" height="442" src="85419d82db581b04ed6af3231f961936.iix" style="height: 442px; width: 491.965217391304px;" width="492"/></p><p></p><p><strong>CATEGORY 4 - DESIGN ENGAGEMENT</strong></p><p>We wanted to know if anyone was excited enough to help.   Shockingly half the respondents volunteered to help with training.   Three respondents also let us know of work that needed workflow.   Of the work use cases provided, several were candidates for Orchestration.   Going from email + manual effort to catalog + orchestration in one tool generation?   That was probably worth the whole Survey exercise right there.</p><p><img   alt="SurveyResult-Engagement.png" class="jive-image image-3" height="410" src="1b5010c6db149fc068c1fb651f9619df.iix" style="height: 410.438709677419px; width: 461px;" width="461"/></p><p></p><p><strong>LESSONS LEARNED</strong></p><ul><li>We had 4 respondents, but 5 complaints about the word "feel".   I suggested that people felt very strongly that the word feel was the wrong choice.   Wasn't my most well received joke.</li><li>In a couple cases Surveys told us the exact opposite of what we assumed going in.</li><li>Surveys successfully revealed further opportunities to exploit tool capability.</li><li>People really appreciated being a <em>quantified </em>part of the project.</li></ul>
