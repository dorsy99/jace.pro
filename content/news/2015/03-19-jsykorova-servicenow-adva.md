By applying a service orientation to enterprise functions including marketing, legal and finance, ServiceNow is changing the way people work.</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;">At its core, a service is defined as a transaction between a requester and a provider. Every department across the enterprise has its own set of services that can be automated to improve the service experience for both requesters and providers. Customers use ServiceNow to define, structure and automate those services, removing inefficient, manual processes, such as using emails and phone calls to get something done, or spreadsheets to track progress.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600; font-size: 12pt;">Service Management Across the Enterprise</span></p><p style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The new applications and capabilities in this ServiceNow release help organizations structure and enhance the service experience. It provides customers the ability to have a dedicated service catalog and knowledge base for every department. This release allows individual departments to fully configure their own business processes and workflows and to have dedicated analytics and dashboards to provide visibility into the work of each team.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The new applications, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/marketing-service-management.html" style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Marketing Service Management</span></a>, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/legal-service-management.html" style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Legal Service Management</span></a> and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/finance-service-management.html" style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Finance Service Management</span></a>, come pre-populated with common service catalog items that each organization can customize and augment based on their unique requirements. Employees can now use a single system of engagement to request services such as collateral from marketing, contract reviews from legal or purchase orders from finance. All requests are tracked in the system providing up-to-the-minute status, eliminating the need for employees to send dozens of emails to check on progress. Employees can either go straight to a specific department to find information or submit a request or they can search all departments through a new enterprise-wide service portal.</span></p><p></p><p style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600; font-size: 12pt;">Rapid Application Creation</span></p><p style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ServiceNow is also providing customers the ability to rapidly create new applications through a codeless, template-based process.

The application maps these costs to the consumption of these services across the organization. <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/it-financial-management.html" style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">ServiceNow Financial Management</span></a> gives CIOs an interactive dashboard so that IT can drive dynamic cost allocation based on usage rather than an arbitrary "IT tax."</span></p><p></p><p style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600; font-size: 12pt;">New Service Management Features</span></p><p style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This new release improves <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/facilities-service-management.html" style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">ServiceNow Facilities Service Management</span></a> by providing new support for planned maintenance.
