<p>The opening day of ExpoNow was buzzing with activity and the Community HangNow area was no exception.   Our Meet the Expert sessions and Table Topic discussions were a hit with just about 85+ people attending our sessions on Tuesday and 50+ today!   Our MVPs and ServiceNow product experts were generous enough to dedicate their time to hosting these sessions which were attended by companies like Dell, Accenture, Boston University, Delta Faucet and many others.</p><p></p><p>We received some fantastic feedback from both the attendees and our experts about these sessions.   Many felt that getting that personal interaction with these experts was just what they needed to compliment the sessions and labs that they've already attended.   And, our experts also found that these sessions were a good way to help our customers and partners further and, also to get their perspective and feedback.</p><p></p><p>Day one is over and we are just about to wrap up day two with more Meet the Experts and Table Topic sessions in progress.   Please come join us in the Community HangNow area!</p><p></p><p><img   alt="boothphoto.jpeg" class="jive-image image-3" height="237" src="a2f49c4edb5817049c9ffb651f961999.iix" style="height: 236.49032258064514px; width: 316px;" width="316"/>   <img   alt="hangnow photo.jpeg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="236" src="1055b806db5cdfc03eb27a9e0f9619bb.iix" style="height: 236.01208459214502px; width: 315px;" width="316"/>     <img   alt="RAphoto.jpeg" class="jive-image image-4" height="236" src="61d47739db10d3041dcaf3231f9619b6.iix" style="height: 235.74193548387095px; width: 315px;" width="314"/>   <img   alt="photo.jpeg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="240" src="4885594adb50d7041dcaf3231f96196b.iix" style="height: 240.23225806451612px; width: 321px;" width="321"/></p>
