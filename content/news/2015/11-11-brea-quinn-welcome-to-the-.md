<p>The ServiceNow User Group (SNUG) is a program which is developed by ServiceNow users, to create a local ecosystem where ServiceNow customers can gather together to share best practices. The Polish ServiceNow User Group is part of a global community consisting of over 70 groups with members from many countries and industries. It is an open group that has been established to allow local customers and partners to share knowledge and information in Polish or English using discussions, blogs, posts, events and group feeds. Â  </p><p></p><p>We would like to welcome our Polish SNUG leader Mariusz Sosna who will head up both both the online community and in-person SNUG meetings in Poland. Please join and follow this group to stay up to date on local events that will be taking place in the region.</p><p></p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Brea Quinn</p><p>ServiceNow EMEA</p>
