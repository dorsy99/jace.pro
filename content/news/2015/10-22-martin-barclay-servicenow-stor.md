This means that partners globally can now sell premium apps and transact revenue with the global install base of ServiceNow customers. Prior to this announcement,   partners outside of the U.S. were limited to listing free apps on Store.</p><p></p><p>This new Store capability delivers significant benefits to both customers and partners.</p><p></p><p>Customers will benefit from a more geo-diverse and locally/regionally relevant inventory of premium SaaS apps and integrations from a broader partner ecosystem.. This increases the value of the ServiceNow Platform and enables more new app buy vs build decisions, decreasing time to value and cutting app dev costs.</p><p></p><p>Non-U.S. partners now have a new go-to-market channel for their premium apps and integrations. Store is the most efficient and effective way for partners to get their apps discovered by ServiceNow customers, to drive leads via free trials and custom price quotes, and to drive revenue via purchase orders. In many cases, Store enables small-medium sizes ISVs to more quickly and easily transact with large ServiceNow customers who may have stringent supplier approval processes in place. And, they can now leverage the global ServiceNow sales and partner management teams to uncover new opportunities for their premium apps at ServiceNow customers and drive more revenue. On an increasing basis, ServiceNow customers look to Store as the trusted source for certified apps and integrations and to tap into the innovation that the ServiceNow partner ecosystem delivers.</p><p></p><p><span style="color: #646464; font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Interested?
