<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Lately we have been seeing incidents raised after comments made in a Change Request, where Technical Support is expected to see those updates. This is not the case as ServiceNow Technical Support mainly works with incident tickets. If you want technical support to see these updates, do not comment on a change request but create an incident or call instead.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"> <br/>There is only one exception</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">, and that is when we explicitly ask you to confirm an instance name and/or a start and end time in the change.</span></p><p></p><p>If you wish to change the start date in a change or have any question, please always get in contact with us directly, either by calling or by raising an incident.</p><p>This especially applies to auto-upgrade and maintenance changes as this potentially could cause an unexpected outage from a customer perspective.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">If you need to speak to someone, please use one of the contact numbers from our <a title="w.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.html">Support contact page.</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Thank you!</span></p><p>Yvonne</p>
