<p>Over the years, we have added new places to get ServiceNow information such as the community and knowledge bases, but one destination has always been constant: the ServiceNow wiki. We receive all kinds of feedback about the wiki, including suggestions for improvement.</p><p></p><p>Some feedback we have received include:</p><ul><li>It can be hard to find release-specific information.</li><li>It is not mobile-device friendly.</li><li>It is not easy to browse the content and find related topics.</li></ul><p></p><p>With that feedback in mind, a new product documentation site is coming. Â  The new site has a foundation for richer features, easier navigation, and better scalability for our ever-growing body of ServiceNow documentation. The change that will likely have the most impact on your experience with our docs is the ability to find release-specific content.</p><p></p><p>Behind the scenes, our documentation lacked some functionality to provide you with the best platform for content consumption. With the new site, we will be able to get you product information faster than ever, as the new site has enhanced publishing capabilities. We will also be looking forward to the ability to incorporate and repurpose content more efficiently.</p><p></p><p>We expect to release the new product documentation site by the end of 2015. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Don't worry; the ServiceNow wiki will still be available with all of its existing content. This means that any bookmarks or external links will still work. </span></p><p></p><p>Here's a sneak peak at the site design.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="product doc new site.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="0c24fbf9db505704ed6af3231f961935.iix" style="height: 338px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>As we finalize the user experience for the product documentation site, we will update you on the community with the changes that are coming.</p>
