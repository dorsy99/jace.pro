<p>About a year ago, some of us at ServiceNow were sitting around a table on a call discussing all of the updates made, new articles added, and content posted on the community. Looking at the sheer mass of self-service support content we had put together had us in a tizzy. How were we going to get all of this information to our customers, partner, and employees in a way that was easy for them to find and easy for them to share with their colleagues?</p><p></p><p>In March 2014, about a year ago today, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=6c3d2ae5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96199c">@NOWsupport</a> was born.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Support_Space.png" class="image-0 jive-image" src="f3a58d46db9897041dcaf3231f961988.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>In the first year of @NOWsupport on social media, we have seen quite an impact on the overall engagement and consumption of our self-service content. We've seen the views of our <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/groups/servicenow-user-group-sig-knowledge-management/blog/2015/02/13/the-km-reports-im-running-today">Public Knowledge Base articles increase</a>. We also noticed that our social audience values the solutions shared on the community, so keep contributing and help your fellow community members out if they have questions!</p><p></p><p>Here is a quick overview of our first year of sharing support content on social media:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><br/></em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Click to enlarge the infographic</em></p><p><img   alt="social support servicenow copy.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="13cd458edbd41b04ed6af3231f961936.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>Using social media, we have also been able to collect feedback from all of you regarding where our <a title="iki.servicenow.com/" href="https://wiki.servicenow.com/">documentation</a> needs some massaging, clarification, or additions. The great circle of social media has allowed us to create content, share it with all of you, get feedback, and then update or create additional content.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-30 at 2.24.04 PM.png" class="image-0 jive-image" height="303" src="d88dac4edb58d704ed6af3231f96193b.iix" style="height: 303.19801980198px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 339px;" width="339"/></p><h2>Join us for a great second year!
