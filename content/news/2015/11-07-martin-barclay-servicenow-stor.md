<p>The <a title="tore.servicenow.com/" href="https://store.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow Store</a> has a broad and growing range (123 and counting) of certified enterprise SaaS apps from our Technology Partners ecosystem that deliver service management solutions across the entire enterprise, certified and ready to deploy. This cuts application development and testing costs, accelerates time to value, and gives customers a "buy vs build" option.</p><p></p><p>One of those areas is Mobile Device Management (MDM). MDM enables enterprise IT to secure and manage employee mobile devices and usage. For example:</p><p></p><ul><li>device (smartphone and tablet) hardware asset management</li><li>device and user provisioning</li><li>remote lock &amp; wipe</li><li>device partitioning to separate work apps and data from personal</li><li>controlling which apps can be installed/executed</li><li>software update policies</li><li>VPN/encryption enforcement</li><li>airtime usage policies, monitoring, and control</li><li>security profiles</li></ul><p></p><p>Two examples of MDM solutions available on ServiceNow Store are MobiChord and MobileIron.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="mobichord.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="41c80c02db1017041dcaf3231f9619f5.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p></p><p><a title="t.ly/1laUKIV" href="http://bit.ly/1laUKIV">MobiChord</a> is a mobile expense and asset management app that I like to think of as the <a title="ww.truecar.com/" href="https://www.truecar.com/">TrueCar</a> for enterprise mobile device usage cost control. You can read all about the great features and benefits on the Store listing, but for me the coolest part is that it enables Enterprise IT shops to negotiate lower rates for employees service plans, by providing access to anonymized data on what other companies are paying, what other operator rate plans are, and gaining visibility and insight into unused airtime (voice, data, SMS)   on employee   plans that enables increased utilization and usage efficiencies.   Armed with this kind of powerful data, there are six-to-seven figure annual savings to be had by IT departments at large corporations in negotiating corporate service plans with mobile operators.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="mobileiron.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="884dcd8edb5c97041dcaf3231f9619ed.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p><a title="t.ly/1LWmRnR" href="http://bit.ly/1LWmRnR">MobileIron Integration for ServiceNow</a> is a mobile device management solution that enables ServiceNow admins to manage mobile device inventory, status, incidents, and to perform common admin tasks on employee smartphones and tablets. It also enables employees to manage their own devices via the Service Catalog and reduce the impact on the help desk. For joint customers of ServiceNow and MobileIron, this is a great solution that extends the MobileIron Core that defines security and management policies for mobile apps, content, and devices,   to their ServiceNow instance.</p><p></p><p>I encourage ServiceNow customers to explore the Store and the broad range of   "Everything as a Service" certified apps and integrations by filtering on Category or Industry.</p>
