<p>Over the last few weeks we've been piloting a change to <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=612d66e5dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961921">how users file HI Administration question incidents</a>, we are now expanding the pilot to include Knowledge Management question incidents. In the next day or two, customers with community accounts that match their account in HI will be part of pilot group of customers that will experience this change. Our goal is to get your questions answered quickly. If for any reason your question is not getting answered or needs to be converted to an incident, a team dedicated to this program will do that for you.</p><p><img   alt="KM+question+to+community.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="c6eef486dbd497041dcaf3231f9619b7.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 450px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>We will have people from our Development and Support teams watching the Knowledge Management space to answer questions posted from HI that your peers may not have addressed.
