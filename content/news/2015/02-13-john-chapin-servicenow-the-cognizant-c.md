<p>This event is going to occur in 5 cities throughout India on Feb 28, 2015.       There will be semi-finals, and a final judging round at the end of the day.   </p><p>Cash prizes and a trophy!   </p><p>(Some people have said that Jimi Hendrix will play the Start Spangled Banner at the end of the event, but those rumors have not been confirmed.)</p><p></p><p>How many participants will we have...?     Our best estimates are in the 1,000 person range, but it could be more than that.     Some registrants will be uber-geeks, others will be business-process focused.     Will the geeks have an advantage?   -- probably not!</p><p></p><p>The folks that I've spoken with at Cognizant are saying that even the first email announcing this Create-A-Thon has generated quite a big buzz.</p>
