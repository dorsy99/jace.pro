As we were preparing our SOW for Phase 2, we took note that our Centralized Service Desk likely won't be rolled out for several months, and therefore we won't be using a lot of the functionality we are implementing until then. We created a table of what functionality could be used prior to our rollout &amp; what we wouldn't use until the big rollout. It clearly makes sense to move sooner the functionality we can start using immediately. Meaning PPM functionality. Woohoo! So finishing setting up PPM is now Phase 2, to begin ASAP. I went ahead &amp; scheduled 3 requirements PPM sessions, and will work on building in very specific requirements discussions into the Â  meeting invite: </span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">2 hours for overall flow across the modules</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">1.5 hours for Project requirements</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">2 hours for SDLC requirements</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">For the SDLC meeting, in the invite I provided a link to the </span><a href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Special:Book&amp;bookcmd=download&amp;collection_id=f295bebecd9764a2&amp;writer=rl&amp;return_to=Special%3ABook,%20http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Book:Scrum_Process_Pack"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #1155cc; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline;">Booklet on how ServiceNow's SDLC application works</span></a><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">It will be tricky to figure out who should attend the Project vs SDLC sessions, since we were going to try to figure out where small efforts would live - Project vs SDLC. </span></p><p><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline;">PPM</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">: </span></span><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Also significant is that we finished defining our future project request/review/approval process leveraging ServiceNow (we had been using a simple Demand process until we finalized this process). </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0XAtBK8rf5qR2JnQXlUVFVKYW8/view?usp=sharing"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #1155cc; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline;">Here </span></a><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">you can view the process. Some notes on our process:</span></span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">Not using surveys yet</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">Definition of what qualifies to be in the Project module is TBD. Right now it's open, and I'm nervous about having a landslide of piddly efforts in Project to dive through when looking for the meaningful projects, or having to add a dropdown or filters to find what the meaningful ones are.</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">We're trying to figure out how to keep a queue of 'filler' projects, how to pull from that queue when needed, prioritize the queue, etc.</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; font-weight: normal;">Our organization doesn't have formal methodology, templates, etc. yet. And aren't ready for a fully developed methodology or templates. We're taking things step by step.</span></li></ul><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Now we need to review this with leadership &amp; get the process started, and incorporate this into requirements for our new Phase 2! </span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline;">Phase 1 Updates</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">ServiceCatalog UAT: We realized people are testing to the script, and not looking deeper at certain fields appearing on the form that perhaps shouldn't (e.g., 'approval state' when approval isn't required). It's too late to have everyone go back &amp; redo testing, and they are too busy to. I will do deep UAT for all of our Service Catalog items so nothing is missed. </span></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Started playing with Visual Task Boards to illustrate to our directors how they will be able to find their team's work across modules (Incidents, Demands, Projects, Enhancements, ServiceCatalog requests, etc.). I have tried showing this to some, but they don't seem ready to discuss it yet. </span></p>
