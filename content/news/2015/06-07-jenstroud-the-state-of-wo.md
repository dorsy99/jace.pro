<p>On Tuesday, June 9th at 10am PST, I will be a panelist on a very interesting platform - Crowd Chat.   The topic is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>State Of Work in HR</strong></span>.   The session will be moderated by Bill Kutik, a leading independent analyst in the HR Technology marketplace.   I will be joined by fellow panelists:   Claire Schooley, principal HR analyst with Forrester and Robert Pickering, CIO at AAA Allied Group.   We will talk about what service management means in Human Resources; what employees these days expect from their employers in terms of HR services and support; what challenges HR organizations are experiencing as they transform the way they get work done; and so much more.   Please join us for this discussion and let us know what you think.   It will be a VERY FAST hour with a lot of discussion but you'll have the opportunity to go back and read all of the posts and responses.   Hope to "chat" with you next week!</p><p></p><p>Click on the following link for more details:</p><p></p><p><span> </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" data-containerid="2733" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="4288" data-objecttype="38" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=039dae69dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961925">https://community.servicenow.com/community/news/blog/2015/06/02/future-of-work-can-service-management-save-hr-and-employee-productivity</a></p><p></p><p></p><p>Tuesday, June 9th at 10am PST</p><p>Twitter Handle:   #StateofWork<br/>URL:   www.crowdchat.net/#StateofWork<br/>Crowd Chat Title:   TheState of Work: HR   <br/>Blog Title:   Future of Work: Is Email Killing HR Productivity?</p>
