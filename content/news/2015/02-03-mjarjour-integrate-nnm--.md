<h2>What does HP NNM, NetApp, vCenter and vCops have in common?</h2><p></p><p>Well, I can think of many similarities but just to name a few, here are some:</p><ul><li>They are all commonly used across many enterprises.</li><li>They all manage and/or monitor critical business services and applications.</li><li>The recommended (and sometime the only) alert integration method is through SNMP traps.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>Integrate SNMP tools with ServiceNow</h2><p></p><p>In the world of Event Management, sending SNMP traps to the manager of managers is a very common and known practice.   So what do you do when you need to integrate SNMP tools with ServiceNow? Traps, because of their nature cannot be sent directly to ServiceNow, yet the need to integrate their data with ServiceNow is there.</p><p></p><p>Evanios Operations is an enterprise class event manager that runs natively on ServiceNow. It provides an open integration toolkit that supports common integration methods such as SNMP, Web Service, and Command Line integrations. In addition, Evanios has created out of the box event integration packages with HP NNM, NetApp, vCenter and vCops so getting its events integrated with ServiceNow is now possible, and even better can be done in less than 1 hour.</p><p></p><p>Because of our out of the box SNMP mapping form, the SNMP traps received from these tools will be mapped automatically to ServiceNow fields so the data received in ServiceNow will be readable and ready to be used. Whether you need to correlate the events with other monitoring solution (for example SCOM or Nagios), enrich it with CMDB data or simply open an incident or update an existing incident, all of that is now possible with a few clicks.</p><p></p><h2>Some example of how SNMP tools Integrate with ServiceNow</h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>What type of information is being mapped automatically with the HP NNM?   The table below lists what fields from HP is automatically mapped.</strong></li></ul><p></p><p><a href="http://www.evanios.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HP-NNM-Field-Mapping.png"><img alt="HP-NNM Field Mapping" class="wp-image-2034 size-full alignnone jiveImage" height="719" src="http://www.evanios.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HP-NNM-Field-Mapping.png" width="784"/></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><strong>How will a vCops alert appear in ServiceNow?
