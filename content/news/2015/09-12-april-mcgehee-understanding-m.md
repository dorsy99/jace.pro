<p>Mobile means more than just being on-the-go â€” it's the ability to get more work done while moving freely about the office. The <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Smartphone_Interface#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Smartphone_Interface#gsc.tab=0">mobile user interface</a> and the tablet user interface offer different views. It's very important to understand the capabilities as well as the limitations you will see while using ServiceNow out of the default view and on your mobile devices (both smartphone and tablet).</p><p></p><p>First, let's start with what the default view actually is. This is the view that is given to all forms and lists if no other view is specified. For example, you might have an incident form with a default view that has 10 or more different fields that are editable, but this isn't very aesthetically pleasing for mobile users. Creating a <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551074" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0551074">mobile view</a> can allow you to select the fields that are most important to you and your organization, making forms more user friendly.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="Incident form.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="6f88a842db909304b322f4621f96199e.iix" style="height: 365px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p><img   alt="Mobile incident form new.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="652" src="f5e78402db9c5fc03eb27a9e0f961913.iix" style="height: 651.948387096774px; width: 504px; float: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="504"/></p><p></p><p>The mobile view is the default view for forms and list layouts on all mobile and tablet devices. Mobile views need to be <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=View_Management#Creating_Views" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=View_Management#Creating_Views">set up</a> for all tables or the default view will show on your mobile devices but keep in mind there are <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Smartphone_Interface#Unsupported_Features" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Smartphone_Interface#Unsupported_Features">unsupported features</a> in the mobile view. Creating a mobile view allows you to do away with unexpected behavior for mobile users by removing the unsupported features you have in your default views. A good example of this is certain <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Variable_Types#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Variable_Types#gsc.tab=0">variable types</a> are not compatible with the mobile view. Removing the fields that have these unsupported variables is a good practice for ensuring users don't come across any errors.</p><p></p><h3>Important things to remember about the Desktop View vs. Mobile View:</h3><ul><li>Other views for forms are not available (the only exception is when you don't set up your mobile view so the default view is used).</li><li>Additional custom views cannot be created.</li><li>Some features are unsupported (HTML fields, chat, VTB, and embedded lists, etc.).</li></ul><p></p><p>These UI limitations are built into the mobile UI to limit the amount of information loaded due to the lack of screen real estate. The mobile view allows you to only see the first section on a form. You do have the ability to add additional sections to your form, though it should be noted that this could cause some errors or the inability to save if you do so. This is because you won't be able to see the additional sections. If you have a mandatory field, you won't be able to edit it and save. This can also happen if you're using a default view and there's a mandatory field on a section other than the main one.</p><p></p><p>If you don't want to run into any of these pesky problems, it's extremely important to <strong>set up views for all of the tables you commonly access on your mobile devices</strong>.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">The UI limitations are also due to limited hardware on mobile devices, as well as making sure we have a set of features that will function on multiple mobile platforms.</span></p><p></p><p>The tablet user interface shadows the same rules as mobile. The mobile view is used if it's been set up and the default view is used otherwise. The big difference between the mobile and tablet views is that the tablet shows more form sections! Don't get too excited here because the mobile view and tablet view are the same thing. Make sure you still aren't putting any of those mandatory fields in these additional sections because your mobile users will get an error and won't be able to save.</p><p></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><strong><br/></strong></span></p>
