<p>Do you have a question related to HI Administration? If so, you will be delighted to know that many Hi Admin questions are answered on the community, documented in our Knowledge Base or covered in a video demo. With that in mind, we are changing how questions on our HI system will be published and responded to.</p><p></p><h3>What is changing?</h3><p>In an effort to get you the answer you need quickly and leverage a wider audience, ServiceNow is piloting a program where questions submitted with a category of <strong>HI Administration, Knowledge Management, Incident Management, Service Catalog, Problem management, Change management, Portfolio management, Reporting, Performance Analytics, Authentication, or Email</strong> will now be posted as a question on the Community instead of filed as a low priority incident in HI. The goal is to leverage your peers and ecosystem of experience ServiceNow users to get you a response quicker and more efficiently.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Note: This only applies if you are filing a question incident in the HI Administration, Knowledge Management, and Service Catalog categories <strong>and</strong> have a HI account that corresponds to your Community account.</em></p><p></p><p>Here's a look at the basic flow:</p><p><img   alt="HIQuestions.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="3ca878cadbdc5f048c8ef4621f9619d7.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 180px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>You'll <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=f4bc6a25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961948">receive community email notifications</a> when somebody replies to your post. ServiceNow will be monitoring to ensure questions are answered accurately and not ignored. We'll have our HI team monitoring the Community to assist when necessary.</p><p></p><h3>When is the change occurring?</h3><p>The pilot program will launch later this month.</p><p></p><p>With that said, the Community is a public forum and your content is viewable by all of its members. If you are concerned about having customer identifiable information being present on your profile and associated with your HI Administration question, you can always edit your profile privacy settings.</p><p></p><h3>How to edit your profile on the Community.</h3><p>If you would like to<a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_article&sys_id=f4bc6a25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961948"> adjust your community profile</a> to add, remove or alter information:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Click your name in the top-right area of the banner.</li><li>Choose <strong>Edit Profile</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Your Profile</strong> tab.
