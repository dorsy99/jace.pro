<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">First, an introductory aside. I strongly prefer the term "clients" to the term "customers." I believe that if you are a provider of services, such as cloud-based software or consulting, your goal is successful, continuing, long-term relationships. Customers can buy something once and never do business with you again. Clients, not so much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">That said, in case you hadn't yet heard or read the news, <a title="w.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-expands-into-governance-risk-and-compliance.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-expands-into-governance-risk-and-compliance.html">ServiceNow is acquiring Intréis</a>. To my mind, this is a great thing for any and all ServiceNow clients seeking to maximize the <a _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=047dae29dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96191a"><strong>a</strong>gility, <strong>r</strong>esilience, and <strong>t</strong>rustworthiness (or "ART-fulness")</a> of their enterprises by optimizing their processes and services. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><img   alt="ARTful SN-Intreis Image.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="748b540adb5c9704ed6af3231f9619af.iix" style="height: auto; float: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">Even more significantly, it's a textbook example of what happens when a company walks its talk about putting customers and colleagues first. In case you've never seen it, here's the Intréis Manifesto, as copied from the Intréis Web site.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>"Let's take a stand against the enemy of service excellence, employee engagement &amp; productivity, and workplace happiness.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">"Bad processes increase complexity, ineffectiveness, and wasted resources.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">"Bad processes result in employee disengagement and workplace misery.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">"Bad processes bring unhappiness to all stakeholders.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">"Bad processes make people miss birthdays, anniversaries, and the things that truly matter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><strong>"Together we will eliminate all bad processes, and the world will be a more joyful place for all; even for our friends in the most highly regulated sectors."</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">How could you not want to work with a company where leadership believes in and executes upon such things, as an employee or a client? I couldn't resist it, which is why I was thrilled to be invited to join Intréis in September of 2014.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">But can such high-minded ideals possibly be good for business? Well, Intréis is a young, small company, operating in a highly specialized arena — a situation fraught with opportunities to confuse, disappoint, or even to anger clients. Yet I know of no Intréis clients who have not been pleased or delighted with the company and its people, before I arrived and since I joined. And I have enjoyed and been impressed by every single member of the Intréis team, from executive leadership to the newest intern.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">If you are a ServiceNow client pursuing GRC-related initiatives who has not yet experienced doing business with Intréis people, seek them out as they become integrated into the ServiceNow product development and professional services teams. I am certain that you will be favorably impressed. And if you have done business with Intréis people, I think you can look forward to more of what you've come to expect and enjoy as they take up their new roles at ServiceNow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">On a personal note, I have learned much during my time at Intréis, and am deeply grateful, for that time and for the people I've met and with whom I've gotten to work. I am saddened that I won't be joining my Intréis friends and colleagues as they transition into ServiceNow. But I am thrilled for them, for ServiceNow, and for the clients I expect to benefit greatly from the ServiceNow-Intréis combination. I hope that the Intréis culture and commitment to treating clients and colleagues well enhances ServiceNow — and to take that culture and commitment with me wherever I end up next.</span></p>
