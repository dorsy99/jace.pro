<p>If you've recently had a company name change or maybe another company has just acquired your company, you'll probably be looking to <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550695" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550695">rename your ServiceNow instance</a> soon. This can now easily be done through a Service Catalog request in the <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547203" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547203">Customer Self-Service Portal </a><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">for all non-production instances. An instance rename is still available for production instances but due to the higher risk involved we have those instances managed through customer support.</span></p><p></p><p>Users with the following roles can request that their instance be renamed:</p><ul><li>business_customer</li><li>business_customer_admin</li><li>customer</li><li>customer_admin</li><li>partner</li><li>partner_admin</li><li>neebula_customer_admin/ neebula_customer roles.</li></ul><p></p><p>Before requesting to rename your instance there are a few <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550841" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550841">naming requirements</a> that have to be followed that you've probably forgot about because it's been a while since you originally named your instance.</p><ul><li>Production and/or sub-production instances cannot contain the word 'demo' or 'pop' or 'pic' as a suffix.</li><li>Instance names can be alphanumeric.</li><li>Instance names cannot contain special characters (e.g. $, %, &amp;, -, *),</li><li>For instance names 3 characters or below, additional review and approval is required.</li></ul><p></p><p>Now that you've decided on your instances new name, maybe you want it to match your companies new domain name and it meets the requirements above, you can request the rename through the CSS Portal's Service Catalog.</p><p style="margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;"><img   alt="servicenow rename instance catalog.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="4819948edbd89704ed6af3231f9619d0.iix" style="height: 268px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><br/></span></p><h2>To rename your instance:</h2><ol><ol><ol><li>Navigate to hi.service-now.com.</li><li>Do one of the following:<ul><li>Enterprise customers, click <strong>Service Catalog</strong> &gt; <strong>Instance Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Rename an Instance</strong>.</li><li>ServiceWatch customers, click <strong>Self-Service &gt; Rename an Instance</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>In <strong>Please select the Instance</strong>, specify the instance to rename from the filtered reference field.<ol><li>If you are having trouble finding your instance, use "*" for a "contains" query.</li></ol></li><li>Specify the expected date for renamed instance to be available.<br/><strong>Note</strong>: Add the date you would like the cutover to happen.

This can be useful if you have some links you need to update elsewhere before the new instance name goes live. It would be better not to rely on that grace period, but do keep in mind that if you forgot to change some URLs there is a chance that you still have time.</p>
