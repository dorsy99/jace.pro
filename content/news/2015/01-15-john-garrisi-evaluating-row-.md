<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">As software people, we often think in Boolean expressions:   Things are black or white, true or false, red or green. The same goes for<a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Access_Control_Rules#Evaluating_ACL_Rule_Permission_Requirements" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Access_Control_Rules#Evaluating_ACL_Rule_Permission_Requirements"> access permissions in ServiceNow</a>. You either have access or you do not, there are no grey areas.</span></p><p></p><p>I often hear "I have given the ITIL role this access, why does it not work?"</p><p></p><p>When we run the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Access_Control_Rules#Debugging" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Access_Control_Rules#Debugging">Debug Security</a> it tells us "yes" or "no" on access rights.   However, understandings the grey areas may prevent some issue from cropping up or help solve issues when they occur while evaluating row level and field level Access Control Lists (ACLs).</p><p></p><h3>Here are the basics of evaluating ACLs:</h3><ol><li>An ACL record has three control sections that all <strong>have</strong> to evaluate to True.   In other words, the sections (<span style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">condition, script, and requires role)</span> are "ANDed" together. </li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">There are two types of ACLs: Row level and Field level. The difference between Row level and Field level is quite simply the dot.   </span><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Any ACL that has a dot in the field definition, such as task.number, task.* is a Field level ACL.   </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">A Row level ACL will have no dot, such as task, incident etc. In the detail view, these show as Incident —None— or Task —None—.</span></li></ul></li></ol><p></p><p>Now that we know the difference between row level and field level, how are they evaluated? The answer is best explained with a picture:</p><p><img   alt="row field acls servicenow.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="310" src="26e77c4edb989304b322f4621f961969.iix" style="height: 309.738709677419px; width: 406px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="406"/></p><p></p><p>This means that it will evaluate:</p><ul><li>all row level ACLs combined with the logical OR</li><li>all field level ACLs combined with the logical OR</li><li>the results of those will be combined with the logical AND</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">An ACL that allows you to write on any row level, and denies access on all field levels, will not allow access to the record, due to the AND statement between row level and field level.   Only an ACL that allows you to write on any row level, allows you to write on any field level will allow write ability to the record.</span></p><p></p><p>Assuming the row level ACLs evaluate to True, what if some field level ACLs evaluate to true and some do not?   The answer is that it depends on the type of field level ACLs.   Those that are read and evaluate to True will allow the field to display.   Those that are read and evaluate to False will prevent the field from displaying. If the read ACL evaluates to true and the write ACL evaluates to false, the field will display in read only mode.</p>
