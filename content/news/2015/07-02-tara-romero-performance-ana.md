<p>If you have followed our lead and '<a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/performance-analytics/blog/2015/06/29/performance-analytics-whats-the-scoop">Cleaned your Performance Analytics House</a>', you now have an idea of how to better manage your list of sources, indicators, breakdowns and widgets. Now what? You have a list of organized and manageable items, but what is to prevent that list from getting all mucky again? Â  People don't stop working while you are cleaning your house, and if you are like us, you were cleaning as they were working so you were always re-cleaning, how do you prevent this constant loop? The solution was pretty clear - a subprod 'Development' environment for our Performance Analytics needs.</p><p></p><p>We all agreed that PA should be managed as its own entity. Well, in order to do that we had treat it as such.</p><p></p><h2>What we are using our dedicated Development Subprod Environment for:</h2><ul><li>All access requests. Any requests for access to PA (power_user roles), will be granted on the subprod environment (this is only after they have been properly trained. On-boarding will be addressed in a future post).</li><li>All PA proof of concepts. Any time the idea of something new is kicked around, it should be tested out in the subprod environment. For example, if a new script needs testing, a new formula to determine if its the proper measure, anything that needs to be vetted will be done in this environment.</li><li>All PA development work. ALL development work, even if it's been tried and true will be done in the subprod environment to avoid any potential hiccups.</li></ul><p></p><h2>ServiceNow's Development Subprod Environment Requirements:</h2><ol><li>The Subprod environment should be cloned from production every quarter. With exceptions for patches or new releases that come in between, the minimum should be at least every quarter. It is important to have an environment as close to production data as possible for validating and ensuring that the functionality is the same between the two environments.</li><li>Administration will be handled by Performance Analytics team. It is important that ownership of the environment is managed by the PA team to ensure that all policies and procedures are being followed and access requests have been approved by the PA team before users are granted access.<img   alt="servicenow performance analytics checklist.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="461" src="9411988edb149fc068c1fb651f961953.iix" style="height: 461px; width: 320.785634118967px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; float: none;" width="321"/></li></ol><p></p><p>Having a true development environment gives PA admins the opportunity to maintain a clean house in the production environment.</p><ul><li>Have the proper naming conventions been adhered to?</li><li>Is this a duplicate source or indicator?</li><li>Is this the proper way to collect the data?</li></ul><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"></p><p style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">All this can be validated if the work is reviewed in subprod before ever hitting production ensuring a clean and user friendly production environment.
