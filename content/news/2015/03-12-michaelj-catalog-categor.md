<p>Translating instances has always been of importance. After all, what good is working on an instance where you have to google the translation of every fourth word. Translated text fields allow the same field to display different content based on the user's language. Some <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547507" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0547507">changes have been made to the ability to translate text in order to accommodate different dialects</a>.</p><p></p><p>We have recently moved the Title field on the Catalog Category (sc_category.title) table to be a part of the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Translated_Text" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Translated_Text">Translated Text type</a>, instead of <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Language_Internationalization#Translated_Name_.2F_Field" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Language_Internationalization#Translated_Name_.2F_Field">Translated Field type</a>. This is because Translated Text type fields allow for multiple translations to be entered into sys_translated_text table, while Translated Field was only supporting single translation.</p><p><img   alt="translated_text1.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" height="279" src="4cd5e3f1db9c5b048c8ef4621f9619db.iix" style="height: 279px; width: 475.821818181818px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="476"/></p><p><img   alt="translated_text2.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="4b7c0186db54130468c1fb651f9619a1.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">The drawback is that, when upgrading older versions to Eureka, it may happen that your update sets will not track the Title field anymore. Translated Text fields were previously reserved for Items that are considered data, and as such, not tracked by the Update Set.</span></p><p></p><p>This effectively means that you can end up with:</p><ol><li>Updates that are not captured at all</li><li>Update captured and transferred as for default language instead translation. In this case, translated title (e.g. German) replaces you default title (e.g. English) for all languages.</li></ol><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>This does not happen on out-of-the-box instances on Eureka and upgrading to Fuji will apply the following fix.</em></p><p></p><p>In order to make Title field on Catalog Category table tracked by the Update Sets, specific serialiser needs to be used and that is achieved by adding new dictionary attribute to that field which would force <span class="s1">use</span> of the TranslatedTextXMLSerializer on it</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Make the Title field on Catalog Category table tracked by the Update Sets by adding the Dictionary tribute: <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">serializer=com.glide.script.TranslatedTextXMLSerializer</span></h3>
