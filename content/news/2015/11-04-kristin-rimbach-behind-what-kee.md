For the </span><a href="http://www.cancer.gov/"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">National Cancer Institute</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;"> (NCI), </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #232323;">the U.S. government's principal agency for cancer research and </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #232323;">training, </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">IT staff is tasked with responding to and resolving issues at top speed to prevent the breakdown of medical equipment.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">It's a tough job — and IT's ability to respond directly impacts the quality of cancer research and training. Not long ago, the quality and speed of service from IT technicians </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri; line-height: 1.5;">at NCI was hindered by outdated, incorrect, or difficult to find documentation. Productivity across the team was drained by new employee's reliance on veterans for directions and training. Searching for information and back-and-forth questions stood in the way of getting the job done.         </span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">NCI engaged with </span><a _jive_internal="true" href="/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/Outlook Temp/sra.com"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">SRA International</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;"> — </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black; background: white;">a leading provider of IT solutions and professional services to government organizations —</span> <span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">to create </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">an application that provides technical support staff with instant, mobile access and visibility into IT support information. The Knowledge Management &amp; Mobility application, or KM ², provides on-the-go access to pertinent information. </span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">With KM ², built on the ServiceNow platform, technicians can scan a </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">QR barcode<span style="color: black;"> with a mobile device to get immediate access to office floorplans, asset information, detailed customer information, incident history and creation, device-specific technical documentation, vendor support agreements, information to re-order supplies, and device history. </span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black;">The app enables the organization to migrate to a new, improved way of managing and finding documentation and related knowledge and resolve incidents faster than ever before.
