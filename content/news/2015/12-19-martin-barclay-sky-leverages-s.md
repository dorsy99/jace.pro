<p>The ServiceNow Platform has a seemingly infinite set of use cases in the enterprise. The combination of the new Studio IDE and over twenty Platform services such as Workflows, Scripting, Integrations and APIs, Orchestrations, Self-Service Catalog, Reporting &amp; Analytics, Mobile UI, Connect, Visual Task Boards, and on and on mean that ServiceNow admins, developers, architects,and partners can utilize the Platform to literally deliver "Everything as a Service" for departments, shared services, and business units across the enterprise.</p><p></p><p>A great example brought to my attention by my colleague <a __default_attr="9982" __jive_macro_name="user" class="jive_macro jive_macro_user" data-orig-content="keeshenniphof" data-renderedposition="94_370.5580139160156_112_16" href="/community?id=community_user_profile&user=78c016eddb581fc09c9ffb651f9619fd" modifiedtitle="true" title="keeshenniphof">keeshenniphof</a> (thanks Kees!) is <a title="ww.sky.com/" href="https://www.sky.com/">Sky</a>. Sky is a major U.K.based   television, telecom, and broadband provider that initially implemented ServiceNow ITSM to upgrade to a modern, efficient, and user-friendly Incident-Problem-Change solution for IT. However it's clear from the video   that they're doing so much more with the Platform.</p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/PNGl83zLaIc" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Together with ServiceNow Preferred Solutions Partner TeamUltra, Sky has developed and deployed numerous apps, developed by in-house developers (via a very cool "Hothouse" rapid app development approach), TeamUltra, and even apps from ServiceNow Technology Partners including Bomgar remote control (<a title="t.ly/1meZP32" href="http://bit.ly/1meZP32">available on ServiceNow Store</a>). Other cool apps mentioned in the video are a gamification app for the helpdesk, and a consumerized shopping experience for all employees.</p><p></p><p>This is a great example of how customers are leveraging the ServiceNow Platform into multiple use cases and solutions across the enterprise by extending ITSM, developing new Platform apps with in-house devs and Solutions Partners, and deploying pre-built, certified apps from Technology Partners (ISVs)   available on ServiceNow Store.</p><p></p><p>Enjoy the video!</p>
