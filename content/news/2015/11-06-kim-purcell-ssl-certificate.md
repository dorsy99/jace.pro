<p>To continue to ensure the security and privacy for our customers, ServiceNow has recently upgraded our SSL/TLS encryption. The <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information">SSL certificate</a> used by ServiceNow, <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/*.service-now.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://*.service-now.com</a> was upgraded to a SHA-2 certificate beginning in <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#Root_CA_Certificate_post_October_2015" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#Root_CA_Certificate_post_October_2015">October 2015.</a> If you're scratching your head trying to figure out what this all means and determining if your instance has been affected, here are a few commonly asked questions and answers to help you out.</p><p></p><h2>SSL Certificate Q&amp;A</h2><h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What's changed?</span></h2><ul><li>ServiceNow has updated the SSL certificate that supports your instance in our data centers.</li><li>SSL certificate updates will be increasing in frequency to support higher levels of security for your instance.</li><li>ServiceNow SSL certificate changes will now be routine changes, with advance notification no longer being sent for SSL certificate updates. These routine changes may include:<ul><li>replacing the certificate with a new expiration date</li><li>revoking outdated certificates</li><li>adding a feature such as an additional server name<br/><br/></li></ul></li></ul><h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Why this change?</span></h2><p><span>ServiceNow previously provided an interim SHA-1 SSL certificate, which expires in December 2015. As a lead up to this change, the SSL certificate used by ServiceNow, </span><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/*.service-now.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://*.service-now.com</a><span> has been upgraded to a "SHA-2." This will be phased in across data centers.</span></p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How does it impact us?</span></h2><p>This change affects your ability to connect to your instance only if you have <strong>hard-coded our SSL certificate</strong> into your infrastructure. Some cases where hard-coded SSL certificates are found include:</p><ul><li>A proxy server is used to access your ServiceNow instance. The proxy may have the current SSL certificate hard-coded into the proxy software.</li><li>Inbound integrations that connect to your ServiceNow instance. For examples, see <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=List_of_Available_Integrations" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=List_of_Available_Integrations">List of Available Integrations</a>.</li></ul><p>Customers who have integrations, caching or proxy servers that have hard-coded the current ServiceNow SSL certificate may need to do a manual update to trust the new SSL certificate.</p><p></p><h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What if a manual upgrade is needed?</span></h2><p>If you have determined that your instance is impacted by the SSL certificate change and a manual update is required, use the current <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#Root_CA_Certificate_post_October_2015" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#Root_CA_Certificate_post_October_2015">SSL certificate information</a> located in product documentation. Please note that hard-coded certificates are not recommended since ServiceNow will no longer be providing notification for certificate updates.</p><p></p><p>For detailed information about the SSL Certificate, see:</p><p><a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#gsc.tab=0">SSL Certificate Information</a><br/><a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#Changes_to_SSL_Certificates" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SSL_Certificate_Information#Changes_to_SSL_Certificates">Changes to SSL Certificates</a></p>
