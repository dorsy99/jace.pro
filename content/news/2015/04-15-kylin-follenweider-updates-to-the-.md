<p>We have made a few updates to the ServiceNow <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/service-automation-platform/user-interface/blog/2015/03/27/self-service-delivered-now">Customer Self-Service Portal</a> that we released a few weeks ago. Thanks to all of your feedback on HI regarding the new CSS portal, we were able to implement a few things we think you may find favorable.</p><p></p><p>First, we changed the <strong>Create Incident</strong> form so the <strong>Details</strong> field now appears on every type of incident and automatically expands to accommodate more lines of text<strong>. </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">We had decided to hide this field on the incident form for certain types to streamline the incident creation process but you helped us realize that this was an important field.   Also, thanks to your comments, we found a bug with the text field failing to automatically expa</span>nd. That bug has been fixed.</p><p></p><p>Second, some of you reported that the <strong>Create Incident</strong> option seemed buried on the Support page.   So we changed the box heading on the Support page to help make the it more prominent on the page.</p><p><img   alt="Create_incident.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="55f7898adb541b04ed6af3231f9619a6.iix" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">We will continue to monitor feedback and make improvements as more people use the CSS Portal.   Keep sending in comments by clicking on the <strong>Feedback</strong> button on the right side of every page of the CSS portal.</span></p>
