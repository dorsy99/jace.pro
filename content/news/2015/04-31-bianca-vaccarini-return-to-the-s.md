<p>Back buttons can be tricky. Especially in ServiceNow, we often get distracted and click on the browser Back button rather than the in-frame back button only to realize we now have to redo all of our filters that we spent the past 5 minutes putting together (every minute is valuable). You may have noticed this same behavior in the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Main_Page#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Main_Page#gsc.tab=0">ServiceNow product documentation</a>.</p><p></p><p>You would conduct a search on "Discovery Probes" and you find a link on the seventh page of results. Then after you have found the information you were looking for, you decide to go back to the search results to view the other articles containing the same keywords only to realize you are now back to the homepage (or last article you were viewing).</p><p></p><p>Well now when you click on your browser's Back button you are no longer reverted to the product documentation homepage or last viewed article, but back to your search results!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img   alt="prod doc search.jpg" class="image-0 jive-image" src="79af5842dbdc9fc03eb27a9e0f96197e.iix" style="height: 310px; width: 620px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">**Filtering options like the "Wiki Documentation" or "Community Forums" tabs or the "Sort by" selection are also restored when you click the Back button.**</p>
