The application can find devices that connect to your network as well as any running software. It can discover anything from Windows desktops and servers, Linux and UNIX servers, through to printers, storage devices, routers, and switches.</span></p><p></p><p><span class="activityupdategroup">Although the Discovery application caters for the majority of "common" devices, there are many other network attached devices that may be a little more obscure, and you may not be certain if they can actually be discovered at all. As a result, Technical Support is frequently asked questions of this nature concerning Discovery: </span></p><p></p><p><strong><span class="activityupdategroup"><em>"Can Discovery discover this device? Manufacturer: x — Model: x"</em></span></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><img  __jive_id="34589" alt="Discovery.png" class="image-1 jive-image" height="182" src="289034c2db98dfc068c1fb651f9619fe.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 499px; height: 182.083140877598px;" width="499"/></p><p></p><p><span class="activityupdategroup">Although this sort of question appears to be straight forward, I always request that the customers ask themselves a different type of question, which is…</span></p><p><br/><strong> <span class="activityupdategroup"><em>"Does this device actually support a protocol that is supported by Discovery?" </em></span></strong></p><p></p><p><span class="activityupdategroup">As Discovery is an <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_Agentless_Discovery#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_Agentless_Discovery#gsc.tab=0">agentless</a> product,</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span><span class="activityupdategroup"> Administrators do not need to install "agent" software on each device for it to be discovered. </span></p><p></p><p><span class="activityupdategroup">Discovery uses standard <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Discovery_Ports_and_Protocols#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Discovery_Ports_and_Protocols#gsc.tab=0">Protocols and Ports</a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span><span class="activityupdategroup">to discover your devices. If the device supports one of these supported Protocols, then we should be able to obtain rudimentary information from the device. </span></p><p>For example:</p><p></p><p>If a customer has a legacy Compaq AlphaServer running Tru64 UNIX, we can use the Discovery application even though it is not supported by Discovery OOB.</p><p></p><p>Like most UNIX Operating Systems, Tru64 UNIX supports SSH and therefore with a little work; creating Classifiers, Probes, and Sensors, it should be possible to obtain the information required from such a device, and populate it into the CMDB via Discovery.</p><p></p><p>Life becomes more interesting when a device supports the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SNMP_Probe#gsc.tab=0" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=SNMP_Probe#gsc.tab=0">SNMP Protocol</a><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span>. Starting with the Fuji release, we now support over 2,000 SNMP OIDs (Object Identifiers), and this number has been increasing steadily with every new release, as we cater for new and legacy devices.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not every device that has been released will be catered for. ServiceNow supports any device that we can talk to on our protocols with our base classification.If we do not support such a device, it is always worth checking with the manufacturer to see if they have MIBs/OIDs that can be downloaded for a specific device, which can then be installed onto your instance.</p><p><br/><span class="activityupdategroup">You can check if your SNMP devices are supported OOB by going to <strong>Discovery Definition &gt; CI Classification &gt; SNMP System OIDs</strong></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 9.0pt;"></span></p><p><img   alt="discovery device.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" height="328" src="b871dc82db549fc068c1fb651f961926.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 328px; width: 830.040816326531px;" width="830"/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span class="activityupdategroup">You can easily check using the Manufacturer and Model of devices displayed (you may need to personalize the list to add these), and you can then filter your search against the devices. </span><br/> <br/><span class="activityupdategroup">With a little configuration massaging we can uncover many legacy devices. One example was a customer who had a legacy Telephone Exchange, which happened to support SNMP — after a few hours of work (and obtaining the MIBs/OIDs from the manufacturer), they managed to get it Discovered.   </span></p><p></p><p><span class="activityupdategroup">Remember; don't start with asking if your device is Discoverable, but if your device supports a protocol that is supported by Discovery.</span></p>
