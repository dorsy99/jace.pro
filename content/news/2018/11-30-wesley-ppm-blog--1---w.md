<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am taking inspiration from Kelly Kaufmann and attempting to present my firsthand account of our ServiceNow PPM implementation as we move along the maturation of our ServiceNow platform. For anyone who has not read her blogs, please search for Kelly&#39;s name and enjoy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am currently working for a rehab hospital as a one person PMO. I joined the team a little over a year ago after the IT senior staff had committed to approaching projects in a more formal process. Before I joined the team, our org had implemented ServiceNow ITSM. The key focus was on incidents, our service catalog, change management, and IT tickets. We continue to grow our use of ServiceNow and are leveraging the platform to improve our services and responses to our stakeholders. One pet-peeve for me is that I don&#39;t like to refer to our customers as &#34;end-users,&#34; IT and drug dealers are the only people who refer to their customers as &#34;users.&#34; I prefer stakeholders!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As a planner, yes, I am a planner to a fault. My adaptive organization traits are in the 99%! We will not talk about my natural tendencies. I am from southern Georgia (USA) and as the songs say, &#34;I&#39;m like a blue tick hound and like to lay around in the shade.&#34;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So back to planning, as I stated, before my arrival, our IT leadership team had don&#39;t a fantastic job creating a spreadsheet where we were keeping track of our ideas and demand. The spreadsheet was our first attempt at organizing around a demand of IS project. Since IS had already implemented ServiceNow and had identified PPM as our future project planning platform, the idea and demand process was built to match SN PPM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We also defined a multi-phased approach to our PMO work following our crawl, walk, walk a little faster, and then running approach.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Oh, one more thing, as we are progressing in our PMO/ SN PPM efforts, our organization is implementing an enterprise-wide solution that we are treating as a separate program. They have their program director, and the program director is part of our IT leadership team, so the communications line stay open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our first objective for our PMO / PPM effort was to create a SharePoint site which we have used as our crawling and walking home base. For those readers use to SharePoint, we created a few simple lists for projects, programs, and a document library. The IS PMO SharePoint site has allowed us to easily keep track of our ideas, demands, and our project tracking. Since I created the site, I like it! We also created a project workbook for capturing our project milestones and RAAID. We have a few teams that are working with Agile, so we have both a Waterfall and Agile workbook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our key objectives for our work with the PMO are:</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1) Simplicity</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 2) Make the project leadership process fun. It&#39;s fun to me, but not sure all our project leads would call it fun.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 3) Listen to our teams.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 4) Focus on the value of working together, developing people, and exceeding industry benchmarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For reference:</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Initial implementation partner - Sovereign</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ServiceNow Version - Kingston - Moving to London</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ServiceNow Modules - ITSM, PPM will be our first ITBM module</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Industry - Healthcare - Rehab hospital</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stakeholders - 2,000</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Facilities - 3</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">IT Shop - 45</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Service Desk - 4</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I have attached several documents for sharing on our current toolset…</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 1) PMO Presentation</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 2) Project Workbook - Waterfall</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 3) Project Workbook - Agile</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So this is our current state, I can&#39;t wait to do all the mapping to our future state in PPM! There is a ton of other background information. However, the key is that we are now moving in the direction of implementing SN PPM in 2019.</span></p>
