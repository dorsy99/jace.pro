<p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Confession.   I love a deal.   A coupon. A code.   A gift with purchase.   But not just any coupon for anything.   It has to be something that I really want.   Something of value.   Maybe something I've had my eye on and needed a little push to make it happen.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Well, friends, I've got one of those for you.

But hurry—this offer expires February 21!</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">We all want to use company money wisely.   And I'm guessing you are no exception.   So, saving $200 does make a difference.   But what you gain from Knowledge will far exceed any savings you get.   It's about increased productivity.   The simplification of necessary tasks.   An improved service experience for your customers and employees.   </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Knowledge18 is not just another Las Vegas event. Yes, we'll have all the fun stuff for you (and it will be fun!). But we are passionate about sharing how ServiceNow can spark transformation in your business.   We want to help you create experiences for your customers that make them happy to do business with your company.   Now THAT'S a gift with purchase.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">You can <a title="ignon.service-now.com/knowledge_login.do?RelayState=%252F%252Fapp%252Fservicenowexternalprod_g2pknowledgeregistrationhotel_1%252Fexkgr9t5oxldsjwYX0x7%252Fsso%252Fsaml%253FSAMLRequest%253DfZFRb4IwFIX%25252FCunrBpSOKTZCQjRbTNxidNsrqXBVstKy3" href="https://signon.service-now.com/knowledge_login.do?RelayState=%252F%252Fapp%252Fservicenowexternalprod_g2pknowledgeregistrationhotel_1%252Fexkgr9t5oxldsjwYX0x7%252Fsso%252Fsaml%253FSAMLRequest%253DfZFRb4IwFIX%25252FCunrBpSOKTZCQjRbTNxidNsrqXBVstKy3">Register here</a> using the code <strong style="color: black;">D18EBCMTY</strong>. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif; color: black;">Got questions?
