<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39;Tahoma&#39;,sans-serif; color: #538135;">Continuous Monitoring for Configuration Changes</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enterprise environments are not static.   To validate and maintain an optimal compliance posture you need to identify as quickly as possible vulnerabilities and configuration issues that might place your enterprise at risk of a breach or non-compliance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">As many of you are aware ServiceNow Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) continuous monitoring is not new.   Monitoring for compliance or to detect vulnerabilities such as unpatched servers or malware has been possible for quite some time. But what about monitoring to detect risky configuration issues like forgetting to &#34;enable secret&#34; on Cisco appliances, which leaves the authentication credentials on the device in cleartext? Not consistently enforcing password requirements could lead to weak passwords that can be easily compromised. End-users may have local administrative access, where they could inadvertently install malware with privileged systems access. Any of the above situations could present a business risk to an organization.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
<table class="jiveBorder" style="border: 1px solid #ffffff; width: 1034px; height: 398px;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="padding: 6px; text-align: left; width: 34%;">
<p>In Kingston, you are able to implement continuous monitoring, leveraging the capabilities of Configuration Compliance (the new Security Operations application) to broadly detect technical control changes, then respond, review, and monitor - ensuring you can identify and mitigate risks before they become your front-page news.   The Compliance and Risk Management dashboards are automatically updated to display the non-compliance of the control and the heightened risk level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The collection of configuration data necessary to determine control changes is made possible through integration between the Configuration Compliance application and 3<sup>rd</sup> party vulnerability scanners, such as Qualys and Tenable.   Therefore, to obtain the data, the customer must also have the Security Operations package that contains Configuration Compliance.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39;Tahoma&#39;,sans-serif; color: #538135;">Enhancements to Policy and Compliance Management and Risk Management</span></p>
<p><img class="image-12 jive-image" style="width: 583px; height: 359.203px;" src="9ffe414adb14d304b322f4621f961991.iix" alt="Kingston Blog image 2b of 3 sm2.jpg" width="583" height="359" align="right" />Maintaining a strong compliance posture is critical, but it&#39;s challenging to obtain an accurate assessment of risks and compliance; and to see changes in real-time.   Real-time dashboards that provide a visual overview and prioritized representation of your risk and compliance posture are ideal for easily identifying where to direct your response efforts, but rarely available.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Real-time dashboards are an important feature of ServiceNow GRC and greatly enhance the overall user experience.   Enhanced risk management capabilities in Kingston include a <em>new and improved Heat Map</em> to better visualize and prioritize risks.   Faster identification and response helps ensure a stronger compliance posture.</li><li>In some cases, meeting policy or compliance requirements is not possible due to extraordinary circumstances.   A new policy exception dashboard and workflows have been added to ensure exceptions are appropriately reviewed and assessed for a truer overview of an enterprise&#39;s compliance posture.</li></ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Part of the exception process is the ability to request a risk review and acceptance.   In Kingston, improved risk acceptance capabilities have been added to better manage critical risks.     More accurate assessment of your compliance posture allows you to direct your efforts for the greatest impact.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It should be noted that the policy exception will be reflected in the compliance overview dashboard (exempted policy marked as compliant), but the risk score will continue to reflect the inherent risk even though the risk has been accepted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<ul><li>Other miscellaneous enhancements in Kingston include the ability to:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Define a hierarchy of policies, policy statements, procedures, plans, standards, etc. to provide more flexibility so you can structure your policies and policy statements to suit your business needs</li><li>Group issues and tasks, which not only vastly improves your ability to manage and remediate issues; but also speeds your time to remediation.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39;Tahoma&#39;,sans-serif; color: #538135;">Out-of-the-Box SOX Content </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="image-11 jive-image" style="float: right; height: 363px; width: 601.871px;" src="69a967fddbd41fc068c1fb651f961994.iix" alt="Kingston Blog image 3 of 3 sm5.jpg" width="602" height="363" />The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requires all publicly held companies to establish internal controls and procedures for financial reporting to reduce the possibility of corporate fraud.   It has been more than 10 years since the initial passage of the SOX Act and even today many organizations still struggle to fulfill their auditing and compliance requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The SOX Content Pack helps reduce the burden for internal IT and external auditors when doing SOX audits with new out-of-the-box content including templates, indicators, and reporting specific for SOX compliance; that ServiceNow itself has found invaluable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Look for a new profile structure and common risks and controls that you would find within those profiles.   Streamline the process for internal stakeholders with a predefined template and consolidated assessments and evidence to facilitate external SOX audit engagements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The SOX content pack will be available at a date somewhat after the release for Kingston at no change and can be applied as an update set to any release from Jakarta onward<strong>.   </strong>We still support the Unified Compliance Framework (UCF) integration, which is available for a fee and does include some SOX content.</p>
