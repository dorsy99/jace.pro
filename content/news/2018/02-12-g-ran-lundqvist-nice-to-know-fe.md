<p>There are so many topics to write about and so little time to do it. This has been a post I've been trying to do for quite a while and now finally had some time over a sunday evening =)</p><p></p><p>Here I will show you a couple of things that hopefully will help you in your day to day business and I really hope you already knew them all, but I do think and hope that at least some of these you can mark as checked.</p><p></p><p>This is what's on the menu today:</p><p></p><ul><li>Fastest way to navigate through the application navigator and all it's applications and modules.</li><li>The good use of .list/.config &amp; .do and difference of doing it with upper and lowercase letters (<strong>*EDIT* </strong>.form works even better than .do since it works as .FORM as well)</li><li>How to be that lazy and use Syntax Macro Editor to skip all that repeatable code writing</li><li>And I round up with 2(3) scripts that I have found under my years and kept well preserved (<strong>*EDIT* </strong>Nowdays you dont need security admin to run scripts - Background, just a old habit of mine):<ul><li>findSysID - Use this to find which record &amp; table a specific sys_id belongs to.</li><li>getDuplicates - Use this to find all records in a table that has the same value in a field. E.g. show me all user records that has the same email.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/4Dp2rlMO-7c" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p>I have also talked to some of you about these videos and now you can easy download an update set with all those scripts I show in the video. These can be found here at GitHub where I'm planning to put all update sets related to my posts: <a href="https://github.com/goranlundqvist/Update-sets#nice-features-to-know-about-in-servicenow" title="https://github.com/goranlundqvist/Update-sets#nice-features-to-know-about-in-servicenow">https://github.com/goranlundqvist/Update-sets#nice-features-to-know-about-in-servicenow</a></p><p></p><p>//GÃ¶ran</p><p></p><p><img   alt="sn-community-mvp.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="7d9933b9db145fc068c1fb651f961949.iix" style="width: auto; height: auto;"/><img   alt="Symfoni Logo Color Box.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" height="57" src="ee291542db1c1b04ed6af3231f9619e7.iix" style="width: 194px; height: 56.6355px;" width="194"/></p>
