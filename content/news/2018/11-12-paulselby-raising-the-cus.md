In this story, that&#39;s not the case.</em></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I faced a dilemma recently. I had ordered something that would be delivered while I was out of town. Normally this wouldn&#39;t be an issue; someone would eventually be home to retrieve the package from the porch. The problem was this was a valuable item and the package might sit for hours. With the holidays approaching making <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/technology/packages-holiday-season-porch-pirates-strike.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">porch pirates</a> a larger threat, I thought I&#39;d see if any options might exist to address my concerns.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/top-customer-service-trends-for-2018/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Like most customers</a>, I started my quest online to see if I could find a solution to my problem. I tried the vendor first, but they didn&#39;t offer any options once the item had left the warehouse. Then I tried the shipper.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This particular shipper is one of the &#34;big two&#34; in the United States. While I have used them to ship the occasional package, I was not familiar with all the services they offered. I was pleasantly surprised to discover I had a few options for my situation: delay delivery to another day of my choice for a nominal fee, hold at one of their local facilities for </span></span>pickup,<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;"> or have it delivered to a lockbox I could access twenty-four hours a day. I opted for the third option, figuring I could pick it up on my way home from the airport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">This ended up being a very effortless process. I arrived home from the trip package in-hand and a very satisfied customer–a happy ending! This would not have been the result had the shipper not done four things.  </span></p>
<h1><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Identify exceptions</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">A delivery company&#39;s primary job–their contribution to the customer journey–is to get packages from point A to B. Granted, this is by no means an easy task when all the nuances of moving boxes around the world are considered. Still, it&#39;s just one part of the purchase process for the buyer in the overall journey they are on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">At some point, this shipping company had recognized their role wasn&#39;t always a straight line. Events occur in people&#39;s lives that can disrupt this process. A real concern is the security of a package when someone won&#39;t be available to receive it. They had identified this and determined they could address it.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Give options</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Realizing that the customer journey isn&#39;t always direct and simple is a positive first step. From there, they could have chosen to offer one alternative to address the situation, effectively force-fitting an option that might not work for every customer. Even if slightly inconvenient, that one option would be preferable to a lost package, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">The shipping company instead offered three alternatives. Perhaps the customer wasn&#39;t sure when they would be home for a delivery. Perhaps they didn&#39;t want to incur additional charges. All possible concerns that might arise for a customer in this situation were addressed.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Automate and inform</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">My first inclination was to go online for a solution. Not only did I find the answer I was looking for, but each of the options could be initiated directly from the website––no need to call, email, or chat with customer service. In addition to redirecting the package, I was also able to not only subscribe to regular text message updates as to the success or failure of the redirect but also a confirmation message once the package was available for pickup in the lockbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Customers go online for customer service because it&#39;s available anytime and anywhere and they can address problems at a time convenient to them. It&#39;s no wonder why customers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2018/05/07/how-to-deliver-exceptional-self-service-customer-experience-design-principles-and-common-sense-tips/#75b7eeeb4a4f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">prefer self-service</a>. If a customer needs to make changes to an order or a delivery due to unexpected circumstances, this shipper was keeping their experience positive by making actions as simple as a few clicks or taps and providing them with proactive updates to ensure they stay informed.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Trustworthy</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">I had never tried using an option to delay and redirect a package delivery. Though we live in the twenty-first century, one part of me thought it was somewhat risky to attempt to redirect a package already en-route. While the package had a tracking number and was insured, still if it were lost in transit, that would be just as inconvenient as it being s</span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">tolen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">What overcame these concerns was the shipper&#39;s excellent reputation. They are a brand respected worldwide for their package delivery and logistics solutions. More than half of the items I order online are delivered by them and over many years they have earned my respect and trust. Despite my concerns, their reputation took away the reluctance I had in taking this alternate path. I would probably have tried to arrange for someone to be at my house the originally planned day of delivery if this were not the case.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Going beyond what&#39;s expected</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">In e-commerce transactions, the shipper is really just a middleman, one of the steps in the overall customer journey. For this particular shipping company, what makes its contribution unique are the steps it took to ensure customer delight and a favorable outcome despite disruptions to the standard delivery process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">I had already had many prior positive experiences with this shipper. This event further cemented them in my mind as the first choice when either having a package shipped to me or when shipping something myself. Companies like this that consider the exceptions that occur in their customers&#39; journey and have easily accessible remedies available are the companies customers will appreciate and reward with loyalty and positive referrals.</span></p>
