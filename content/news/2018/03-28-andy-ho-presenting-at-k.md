<p>I&#39;ve been asked present at Knowledge18 this year. It&#39;s one of those sessions that will be delivered in the Pavilion (showroom floor area) and not a traditional lab type delivery. It will likely be 30 minutes and will seek to provide customers and partners with an introduction to the topic at hand, in my case, our training and certification programs.</p>
<p>Assuming the attendees are new to ServiceNow, what should I focus on?</p>
<p>My topic is: <strong>Develop a world class technical team. </strong></p>
<p>My preliminary outline looks like this:</p>
<ol><li>ServiceNow Training and Certification Program Overview</li><li>Our Offerings</li><li>How to Develop a World Class team</li><li>Q&amp;A</li></ol>
<p>The primary section is #3. I have some ideas but was hoping to solicit some feedback and suggestions from people as I start to finalize my content. I appreciate your time and hope to see you there!</p>
