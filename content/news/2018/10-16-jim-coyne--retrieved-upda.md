<p> </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a pretty simple and useful addition to the &#34;System Update Sets&#34; Application - three new Modules:<br /><br /></p>

<p>They will display the Retrieved Update Sets in the 3 different States. Not a big enhancement, but I use them all the time when I&#39;m importing Update Sets from another instance. Just part of my workflow.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve attached an XML file so you can just import it into your instance to get all three Modules. As always, try it out in your company&#39;s development instance first, or better yet, your own personal development instance.</p>
