<p>Nothing is worse when critical business processes can’t be executed because your cloud software is slowing down or not available. Real-time monitoring and alerts can warn you of slowdowns and outages and help you prevent and respond to issues quickly.<br /><br />ServiceNow already offers <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/hisp" rel="nofollow">world-class technical support</a> as part of your subscription –  including the <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/hi_login.do" rel="nofollow">HI Service Portal</a>, and a <a href="community" rel="nofollow">support community</a>. But did you know that ServiceNow also offers Proactive Monitoring? And that it is already included at no extra cost as part of your ServiceNow subscription?</p>
<p><strong>What is Proactive Monitoring? <br /></strong>ServiceNow Proactive Monitoring helps restore application functionality faster – often rectifying issues in the background before they even affect your instance. And it helps reduce the likelihood of future errors and system problems.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong><br />Using real-time data collection capabilities, ServiceNow proactively monitors your instance 24x7x365 from our dedicated site reliability centers.<img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="d0e68acbdb14a3c867a72926ca961983.iix" />Built on the ServiceNow Event Management platform, we constantly monitor reachability to the data center from external networks. This helps us to identify and rectify capacity or performance issues like disk usage, response times and transaction rates. We monitor over 135,000 events and 80,000 alerts per month. We perform health checks to determine when any single instance is unavailable. <br /><br />And when issues do occur, we automatically open a support instance and work diligently to resolve your issue. And for issues that take longer to rectify, we will notify you.  </p>
<p>Performance Monitoring includes monitoring for slowness and degradation in response time, so issues can be detected and resolved <em>before</em> they affect your business operations. We also monitor for events and outbound emails that don’t get processed, and look for transaction anomalies. Additionally, we actively monitor authentication issues in the background – such as looking at SAML failures, and making sure that LDAP servers have been used in the last 72 hours.</p>
<p>We also perform capacity management and planning so that you never run out of space. We do an ongoing system health check – checking node level CPU load averages, system memory, status of the disk, power and fan – and we monitor the rate of change on the hard disk.<br /><br />All of this performance monitoring is done in the background to make sure that your business workflow doesn’t slowdown or stop. While some cloud software companies charge extra for this service, it’s one of the benefits of being a ServiceNow customer that’s already included with your subscription.   </p>
