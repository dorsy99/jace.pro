<p>Have you considered implementing an Agile software development framework for your software development lifecycle? </p>
<p>In this installment of our <a title="" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;6e7d6269dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619c0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NOWSupport best practices series</a>, we provide a quick overview of Agile development, then we take a closer look at Agile Development 2.0 in the Now platform, and how it can help your team transition to Agile successfully. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is Agile software development?</h2>
<p>Agile software development is a flexible approach where user requirements evolve into software solutions through an iterative collaboration between the developer and the users working together in tightly knit teams. This approach is implemented in a framework called Scrum, which lays out the roles of the development personnel and their activities. For more details, visit <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrum Alliance</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Agile approach—long-term and team-oriented</h3>
<p>In essence, Agile is a long-term approach. Agile development takes place indefinitely over the lifespan of a product, rather than for a specific time period – improving the product release after release. It ends only when the value it adds to the product no longer justifies the cost. Agile methods can also be used in traditional development projects with a limited timeframe.</p>
<p><br />The Agile approach is very team-oriented. To minimize external dependencies, Scrum teams are cross-functional and self-sufficient, with all the people they need to deliver working software. By working together closely and transparently with the product’s users, the Scrum team can adapt quickly to changing requirements. That’s why they call it Agile!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The basic unit of work in Agile development—the story</h3>
<p>The basic unit of work in the Scrum framework is the <em>story</em>, a small effort that develops a specific function for the product. Stories often reflect individual product requirements. Stories are gathered and prioritized in a <em>backlog</em> managed by the <em>product owner</em>.</p>
<p><br />Stories are implemented in <em>sprints</em>, where a team of about a half-dozen developers implement a few stories in a few weeks. Each sprint produces fully functional, tested software for the product. This approach results in continual incremental enhancements to the product, rather than a large set of enhancements at the end of a project or release.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p>Sprints are grouped into <em>epics</em>, which reflect larger portions of the product. And epics may be grouped into <em>themes</em> that reflect major product components. Planning the sprints is a collaboration among the product owner, the <em>Scrum master</em>, who oversees and facilitates the development effort, and the development teams.</p>

<p><br />So Agile promotes close collaboration, and nimble adjustments to changing requirements and issues that arise during a project. In other words, attention to personnel and processes are both critical. Fulfilling the personnel side of the equation is up to you, but we can help you implement the process side.</p>

<h2>Can I use the Agile approach for individual projects? </h2>
<p>Agile Development 2.0 provides you the flexibility to implement a pure Agile approach over the entire life-cycle of a product, or a hybrid approach using Agile methods within a traditional project structure.</p>
<p>This video demonstrates the difference between these approaches:</p>
