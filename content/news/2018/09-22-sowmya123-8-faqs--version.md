<p>The Article versioning feature in <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/reference/get-started-knowledge-end-users.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Knowledge Management</a> allows knowledge contributors to create and maintain multiple versions of a knowledge article. They can create a new version of a knowledge article from an existing published version. This existing version can be either the latest published version or an older outdated version. <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/concept/article-versioning-changes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All changes</a> are stored in the new version of the article and the information in the existing article remains the same.</p>
