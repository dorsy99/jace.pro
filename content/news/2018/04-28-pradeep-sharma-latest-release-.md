<p>Attention Technology Partner developers, we have recently released an updated version of Certification Self-Test Tool, which will have new additional best practice checks. For those of you who have not installed the Certification Self-Test Tool and are new to this process, please refer to the following summary and for those of you who are aware of Certification Self-Test Tool and have the previous version installed in VENXXXXX instance, feel free to skip the summary and refer the section &#34;Steps to Install the Certification Self-Test Tool&#34;.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Certification Self-Test Tool?</strong></p>
<p>The Certification Self-Test Tool enables Scoped Application authors to validate their application against a portion of the tests and requirements that they will encounter during the formal application certification process for listing an application on the store. While not comprehensive, this tool should help application authors get a very good idea of where they stand with regard to certification readiness.</p>
<p>Please note this won&#39;t be all of our tests for certification, some of those require a more contextual analysis and conversation with you, but this will help you address the ~80% of the commonly discovered issues we find in the first few iterations of the certification process. This tool should be run against your applications prior to submitting for certification. It will produce a result set that you can use to determine how close your application is in terms of readiness for certification. This is optional, but will greatly help reduce the time it takes you to get. </p>
<p><strong>Why should you use this application?</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Technology Partner and want to submit an application for certification, this tool will validate your application and give you preliminary test results of the application. This enables you to quickly modify your application as per the ServiceNow recommended best practices. This will help greatly reduce the certification cycle time. </p>
