<p>So a person I tutor on-and-off in ServiceNow approached me the other day wanting to go over questions she got wrong on a few of the exam prep sites.  Those who&#39;ve known me long enough understand my opinion of these sites, but I really had no idea just how *BAD* some of them are.</p>
<p>SO instead of being a perpetual harpy about it, here&#39;s my deal to you, fellow learners.<br />If you encounter an exam prep question that you don&#39;t understand, I&#39;m ready to help you understand both question and answer.  I might guide by way of pointed questions, but I won&#39;t leave you hanging like some of these exam &#34;prep&#34; places will.</p>
