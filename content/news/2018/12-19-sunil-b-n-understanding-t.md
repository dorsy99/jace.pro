<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">The <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-administration/page/administer/task-table/concept/time-card-management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Time card Management</a> feature enables users track their time for the assigned tasks also helps to capture associated cost along with it. Tasks can be any entity which is extended from task table like project, project task, incident, problem, change request. </span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;"><em>Note: I won&#39;t cover what is already there in the documentation. This is applicable for releases below London.</em></span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">In this, I would like to shed light on overview of how approval flow work and what happens beyond that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="02ae8180dbeea340afc902d5ca9619c3.iix" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">Creation Process: <br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">Users can create time cards from Time sheet portal (formerly known as Worker portal). All the time cards created for a week are tied to a time sheet of that week where hours are aggregated for each day. Time cards can also be auto created based on the time spent by user on a particular task. This feature is driven by <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-administration/page/administer/task-table/task/create-time-sheet-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Time sheet policy</a>. Initially state will be &#34;Pending&#34;, once user submits, state will be &#34;Submitted&#34;.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">Approval Process: <br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">Submitted time cards are visible to approvers. Approval process could be 2 step or 1 step process based on the time sheet policy.<br />There is special approval flow if the task is of type Project task where Project Manager has to approve the work logged by the user.<br /><em>Note: If a time card is rejected, state will be &#34;Rejected&#34; and associated time sheet also moves to &#34;Rejected&#34; state.</em></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">Post Processing:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">Once time card is approved and task type is project task, actual hours are updated on relevant resource plan and resource allocation daily table and also on Project task. An <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-it-service-management/page/product/asset-and-configuration/concept/c_ExpenseLine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">expense line</a> would be created based on <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-customer-service-management/page/product/field-service-management/concept/using-rate-types-labor-rate-cards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">labor rate card</a>. <br />All unprocessed expense lines are processed by a daily schedule job which updates actual amount on respective <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-it-business-management/page/product/project-management/concept/cost-plan-breakdown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">cost plan</a> and breakdown. This amount would rollup to project, program and portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">Feel free to ask any questions associated to Time card management.</span></p>
