<p>Is your organization running IT like a business, with visibility into demand and financials, alignment with business goals, and management of projects and resources? Or is IT running itself like a runaway train, with no direction and no one in the driver&#39;s seat?</p>
<p>To get that train back on track, you can get on board with ServiceNow solutions for IT Business Management, including Project Portfolio Management, or PPM.</p>
<p>In this installment of our <a title="" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;6e7d6269dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619c0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NOWSupport best practices series</a>, we take a quick tour of the applications that make up PPM, and guide you to resources to learn more, including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#61;PLCOmiTb5WX3pRc6rrvO425TYSYhsUleuo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Project and Portfolio Management playlist</a> on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/servicenowdemo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NOWsupport YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<h2>What is PPM?</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-business-management/page/product/project-portfolio-suite/concept/c_ProjectPortfolioSuite.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Project Portfolio Management</a> is a suite of applications that provides a simple, team-oriented approach to managing IT projects throughout their lifecycle.</p>

<h2>What is Demand Management?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-business-management/page/product/planning-and-policy/concept/c_DemandManagement.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Demand Management</a> application helps you capture, evaluate, prioritize and approve business requests for implementation consideration. People within your organization provide these ideas for projects or enhancements (strategic requests), or change requests and defect fixes (operational requests). Promising ideas are shared between IT and the business unit, and approved ideas will become demands.  The demand is reviewed by stakeholders, and if approved, becomes a project.</p>

<p>To manage several projects at once, you can organize them into portfolios.</p>
<h2>What is a portfolio?</h2>
<p> A portfolio is a collection of related programs, projects, and demands typically organized by business unit or investment type. </p>
