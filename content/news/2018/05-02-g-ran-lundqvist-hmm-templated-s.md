<p>Templated snippets is a plugin/functionality that has been popping up in the HR area and where ServiceNow is mention it as a functionality. After the plugin has been activated, you can see it’s got its own scoped application called “Templated Snippets”.</p>
<p>So, what is template snippets? It helps e.g. handle repetitive responses which they uses in the communication with the end users. In ServiceNow you might find a row or two about this for the HR agents, but I can see as well the IT Service Desk use it as well. When I sat in the first line we had these responses saved notepad and with copy&amp;paste it was used frequently. With this application you can choose your response and then just click to get it into the clipboard and easy paste into for example close notes or additional comments.</p>
<p>Also worth mention that this feature seems to only work on table extended from task(or a table that has its base table from task). Good to know when creating own custom tables that might want to have this feature.</p>
<p>Remember to not mix this with the “normal” templates that exists. I would rather have seen this to be called something like “response templates” instead. Just to try to keep the confusing at the lowest level.</p>
<p>It‘s very simple to get this up and running and here is how to do it.</p>
