<p>Walk in the doors at the Sands Convention Center in Las Vegas and right off you’ll see things have changed with ServiceNow and Knowledge. To start, we have a new look.</p>
<p>Attendees have the opportunity to see our new brand, “Works for you,” expressed throughout the event—on signage, booths, and more.</p>
<p>We’ve also redesigned our meeting center and ServiceNow Pavilion, expanding them to accommodate more people. For attendees and prospects looking for our media and analysts center, this year, they don’t have to look too far. It’s on the show floor, with more analysts than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Getting into the zone</strong></p>
<p>For those who have questions about their ServiceNow products, about their roadmap with our company, the place to go is the new Knowledge Customer Success zone. Step inside and you enter a warm, friendly environment with whimsical cityscape graphics and signs such as “Let’s do this: Creating your success plan” and “Ready, set, succeed: Assess your success readiness.” It’s where attendees are having 1:1 meetings with subject matter experts to plan their success. For technical questions, they’re meeting with ServiceNow experts in the zone’s Genius Lounge to get answers. And they’re watching more than 80 scheduled presentations in the zone’s four theatres, each dedicated to a phase of the ServiceNow journey.</p>
<p><strong>Mars is a destination</strong></p>
<p>The planet Mars has come to Knowledge through an expanded CreatorCon. Under a red geodesic dome, developers are taking one giant leap for developerkind with the CreatorCon Mission to Mars. They’re solving programming challenges for traveling to Mars and establishing a colony for fame and prizes.</p>
<p>And just down the way is the Developer Hub, the playground of CreatorCon, offering hands-on experiences, Developer Theater with short technical talks, and Tech Now Live. CreatorCon is also the home of the Hackathon. Teams of all types are going head-to-head in this eight-hour quest for more prizes and unfettered glory.</p>
<p><strong>The partners are here</strong></p>
<p>Another new sight on the show floor: more exhibitors than last year. They’re talking about their latest innovations to help attendees make the most of their ServiceNow investment. And they’re handing out tchotchkes.</p>
<p>It’s a new world to experience and enjoy at Knowledge.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on the tchotchkes.</p>
