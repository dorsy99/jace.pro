<p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>We are putting together an initial meeting to discuss the current and future state of the Perth ServiceNow Community. As discussed this should be a group that is led and run by the community members and is not intended to a vendor or partner-led initiative (although able to present from time to time if invited)</p>
<p>Proposed dates are currently either the 8th or 9th of August. Obviously we want to get as many people as possible to attend the initial meeting, so that everyone has a chance to cast their votes, make suggestions and help shape this community. With that in mind, please let us know your preferences are with a quick 1-minute anonymous</p>

<p>So far its a fairly even split between the 8th and 9th, but seems like the majority of people are happy to start at 4pm - Keep the votes coming and have your say. Please feel free to reach out to others who may be interested in joining the community too and get them to sign up!</p>
