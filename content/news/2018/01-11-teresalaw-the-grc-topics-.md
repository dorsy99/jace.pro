<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">As I mentioned in Part 1, my list of the most talked about topics of 2017 would come down to these four.   Furthermore, as threats and business risk continues to grow these topics are going to be as pertinent in 2018 as they were in 2017.</span></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>         <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Data Protection</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">         Third-Party/Vendor Risk</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">         Security/Cyber Risk</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">         Integrated Risk Management</span></li></ol><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Let me finish up my series by addressing the last two topics in my list:</span></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Security/Cyber Risk: </span> </strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Without a certain amount of risk companies become stagnant and fall behind more innovative and agile competitors. Unfortunately, the very thing that allows companies to be successful: embracing new technologies including the Internet of Things, the consumerization of enterprise software, and the move to the cloud makes them easier targets for savvy cyber criminals launching increasingly more sophisticated attacks.   What's at stake is the very essence of an organization: intellectual property, customer data, and the trust that a company is built upon.   </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Organizations must take a more proactive approach to cyber risk.   According to a new PwC report: <em>2017 Risk in review study</em>, many companies see cyber and privacy as top-growing risks, but few are prepared.   Results show that 62% of respondents expect cyber risk to cause disruption in the next 3 years, yet only 9% have high or very high cyber risk maturity.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">ServiceNow Governance, Risk, and Compliance provides a means to increase your risk maturity and control your risk exposure through continuous monitoring with automated dashboard updates so you are always on top of the latest risks.   ServiceNow GRC works hand in hand with ServiceNow Security Operations prioritizing the threats found by Security Operations based on business impact with robust risk scoring using a qualitative or quantitative method, while issues are automatically generated and tracked to completion.</span></p><p></p><table border="1" class="jiveBorder" jive-data-cell="{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;#3D3D3D&quot;,&quot;textAlign&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;padding&quot;:&quot;6&quot;,&quot;backgroundColor&quot;:&quot;transparent&quot;,&quot;fontFamily&quot;:&quot;Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif&quot;,&quot;verticalAlign&quot;:&quot;baseline&quot;}" jive-data-header="{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;#505050&quot;,&quot;backgroundColor&quot;:&quot;#F2F2F2&quot;,&quot;textAlign&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;padding&quot;:&quot;6&quot;}" style="border: 1px solid #ffffff; width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="padding: 6px;"><a href="https://sc.service-now.com/democenter/demo_center_video_vimeo.do?sysparm_demo_video=acc64d781349ea80930834228144b091"><img   alt="Risk Management demo graphic 2.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="48e37379db505704ed6af3231f961953.iix" style="height: auto;"/></a></td><td style="padding: 6px;"><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Check out the Risk Management demo for an overview of the ServiceNow Risk Management application.</p><p></p><p>Read more blogs about cyber risks in:</p><p><a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=315ca6a1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619f0">National Cyber Security Awareness Month: Cyber Awareness and GRC</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="margin-left: .25in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 3.0pt; background: white;"></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>2. Integrated Risk Management</strong>:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">As with many other GRC functions, risk has traditionally been evaluated within departmental silos.   Like taxonomies, each department had their own way of detecting and measuring risk.   Once an unacceptable level of risk was identified it would generally be addressed without any input from other departments.   Where cross-functional collaboration was necessary, emails were exchanged and meetings were held until someone was satisfied that the risk had been appropriately responded to — any tracking was done in spreadsheets and rarely shared.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">This approach to risk has been steadily changing.   Driven primarily by larger organizations, Risk Management is becoming more of an imperative and is being integrated into more business processes. Internal and external data sources and new technologies like artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cognitive learning are providing data that span the organization — breaking down departmental silos.   At the heart of all this a single platform is beginning to emerge to facilitate cross-functional process integration, data sharing, and a single repository or source of truth.   </span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">This holistic approach to risk management provides consistency and a common framework for measuring risk; thereby enabling business leaders to ensure strategic alignment of risk mitigation activities across business processes and the organization.   Analysts, such as Gartner have begun to embrace integrated risk management, as evidenced by the consolidation of the various risk magic quadrant reports.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The key to measuring risk is the ability to gauge it based on business impact.   To make an educated business decision it's not enough to know that there is a high risk. Context regarding the impact to the business is essential to quantify it; to say it represents a $30 million risk to the organization.   The Now platform and ServiceNow GRC provides the common framework, asset-centric approach with a single repository, and robust risk scoring necessary to quantify and appropriately gauge business risk.</span></p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">To find out more about the topics discussed above please visit our website at</span><strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/governance-risk-and-compliance.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: underline; font-family: inherit, serif;"><strong>www.servicenow.com/grc</strong></span></a></span></p>
