<ul><li>Dealing with multiple sources of data </li><li>Maintaining the hygiene of that data </li><li>Managing DR exercise or event activity  and  incident management during those events </li><li>Tracking problems post exercise </li><li>Reporting progress of recovery efforts </li><li>Addressing delta’s in recovery capabilities and Application Impact Analysis (AIA) results </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>A decision is made</strong> </h4>
<p>AIG reviewed six leading BCM products for disaster recovery and chose to implement MaestroRS™, a NOW® Certified Application - built on the NOW® Platform, from Fairchild Resiliency Systems™ for its simplicity of use and its power to connect planning efforts to real-time event management, all developed within an organic ITSM, ITOM, and disaster recovery delivery platform.</p>
<p><strong><img style="max-width: 60%; max-height: 480px; float: left; margin-right: 7px;" src="318dc71cdbd65b00c310fb651f961927.iix" />Multiple Sources</strong><strong> / Hygiene</strong><strong> of Data:</strong> Implementation of MaestroRS™ is allowing AIG to centralize DR planning across the globe within their ServiceNow implementation, simplifying and securing access from multiple disparate data points.  This centralization is allowing the AIG IS DR team to introduce a better understanding of the importance of data quality and standardization of planning across technical and applications teams.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p><strong>Managing DR exercise activity - DR incident management:</strong> Where AIG leveraged Microsoft Office for test facilitation and reporting, exercise activity can now be automated using MaestroRS™, with real-time views into recovery status at plan, application, and the recovery task level.   </p>
<p><strong>Tracking problems post exercise:</strong>  The Recovery &amp; Exercise module also allows the AIG IS DR team to manage remediation efforts and task tracking post-exercise.  Remediation tasks can be created, assigned to specific employees or assignment groups, and tracked to completion within ServiceNow’s Incident and/or Problem Management modules, raising awareness around issues and their resolution as never before! </p>

<p><strong>Progress reporting:</strong> Progress reporting has been simplified from reports sourced from an enterprise  application repository, the CMDB, and assorted Microsoft Office files.  MaestroRS™ and ServiceNow® provide a single source for all reporting requirements and a robust inline reporting tool powered by ServiceNow which allows for reporting of all data elements within MaestroRS™ and ServiceNow®.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Contending with recovery capabilities / </strong><strong>Application Impact Analysis (A</strong><strong>IA) results</strong><strong>: </strong>The simple viewing and reporting of recovery capabilities and gaps allowed by MaestroRS™ will help conquer another challenge for AIG.  The AIA functionality simplifies the calculation of Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), prioritization of applications and gap management where DR Tiers and business requirements are not aligned.  MaestroRS™ highlights gaps and factors <em>both</em> business needs and any interdependencies between applications.  The team will further benefit from improved visualization of IT resource relationships as AIG is enhancing their ServiceNow® implementation with Service Mapping this year.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The operational benefits of unifying disaster recovery planning with ITSM and ITOM activities is not lost on AIG’s IS DR Team as the new ServiceNow® Service Mapping  capabilities will continue to enhance delivery of services and creating full ecosystems maps that will be used to mature AIGs knowledge of the interdependencies applications have and how they may impact each other.  </p>
<p>Fairchild Resiliency Systems™ will be hosting an Expert Event with Nick Ferraro, Principal Consultant, and Ben Love, Director of Technology, in May after Knowledge18 where Nick and Ben will give you a guided tour of MaestroRS™, dig into some of the key features and capabilities, and give you an opportunity to get your questions answered in real time. If you’re interested in BC/DR for your organization, this is an excellent opportunity to learn how MaestroRS™ built on the Now® Platform can help. </p>
<p>We will post another blog with the Expert Event details in the next couple of weeks. </p>

<p>*Editor’s Note: When reviewing this write up, Kurt made two comments worthy of note - “You know if you are a business looking for a solution, just insert &lt;your company name&gt; for AIG, and this could be your success story!”  “Well – what are you waiting for?”  Thank you Kurt!   </p>
