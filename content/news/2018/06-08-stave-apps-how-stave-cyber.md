<p><strong>The Customer</strong></p>
<p>Utilized by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) logistics specialists, the Global Combat Support System (GCSS) is an integrated system that manages business processes for supply, maintenance, property and finance. The world-wide digital platform supports thousands of users. </p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The IT issue resolution database was used for processing information assurance vulnerability alerts (IAVAs). The legacy system had a complex interface. It required manual IAVA input, which lead to data-integrity issues regarding coverage and accuracy. Additionally, the data was not searchable or capable of being read-through quickly. Replacing the system required supporting automation for:</p>
<ul><li>POA&amp;M Creation</li><li>DoDD 8570</li><li>DoDD8140 Compliance Tracking</li><li>IAVA Tracking and Compliance</li><li>Operational Tracking</li><li>NIST RMF, DIACAP DOD RMF Activities</li></ul>
<p>It was already the end of summer and the year-end deadline to renew or retire the contract was rapidly approaching. Despite the aggressive timeline, the team was determined to retire the old system before January 1, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>The GCSS team opted for <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/0ba711fa0fc1ba0055d1cd8ce1050e49/1.0.0?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fq%3Dstave" rel="nofollow">Stave’s Cybersecurity Manager</a>. Cybersecurity Manager is engineered for enterprises, large federal and other public-sector organizations and large enterprises to integrate Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC) and Risk Management Framework (RMF) and security operations into a single solution.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>The secure, cloud-based solution is scalable on the Now Platform™. Cybersecurity Manager was also selected since the software fully integrates with:</p>
<ul><li>Configuration Management Database (CMDB)</li><li>GRC</li><li>SecOps</li><li>Discovery and Continuous Monitoring Tools</li></ul>
<p>In addition, Cybersecurity Manager has a responsive design that may be viewed on a variety of devices including mobile.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compatible on All Devices</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implementation Process </strong></p>
<p>The contract was signed September 2017 and the project started December 1, 2017. After four short weeks, the project was fully deployed and operational by January 1, 2018. This included: </p>
<ul><li>Design</li><li>Implementation</li><li>Testing</li><li>Turn-up</li></ul>
<p>The implementation team encompassed three representatives, including the GCSS Army Project Manager and a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and Stave’s Director of Customer Success. After Stave was provided with a paragraph of needs and a list of requirements, the application was enabled within the development environment. Daily check points were issued to ensure the project was on track. Once all needs and requirements were implemented, Stave provided installment instructions to properly transfer the application into the production environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>
<p>In addition to a fast implementation process, the After Action Review (AAR) showed cyber threat remediation activities and the audit trail now had increased visibility with accurate and complete data, accelerating vulnerable remediation and threat mitigation.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Manager also provided a return on labor efficiency with 400 hours per operator, per year saved. This results in 10 weeks each year that may be reallocated for other responsibilities. Timelines were reduced from an average of 5-7 days to mere minutes.</p>
