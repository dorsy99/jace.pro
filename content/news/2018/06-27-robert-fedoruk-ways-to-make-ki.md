<p>Woudln&#39;t it be awesome if...<br />EVERYONE USED SN TIME SHEETS (Kingston&#43;)</p>
<p>Man, in one version this feature went from horrific to &#34;best I&#39;ve ever seen&#34;.  The smart filling makes like SO much easier and eliminates some of the ideological friction between working tasks and tracking time. </p>
<p>The only thing I&#39;ve consistently got feedback on:  The users love the idea of adding tasks to the time sheet they weren&#39;t assigned to.  &#34;I helped Bob on that big task of his&#34;.  Currently, here&#39;s how they enter that time...<br /><img src="a3abddf3db72d304a8562926ca961987.iix" /></p>
<p>Problem is the users rarely remember the Task number.  Of the teams that I talk to about this, in a week they&#39;ll do a dozen or more.  So I have two suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>1)  Make the &#34;Select a Task&#34; interface a legitimate traditional list view.</strong></p>
<p>This way I can search by who its assigned to, what group its in, who the customer is, when it was opened... whatever.</p>
<p><strong>2)  Smart suggestion:  Tasks I&#39;ve actually touched</strong></p>
<p>If an organization is using Time Worked on a task field, every save potentially logs me accessing the task.  <br /><img src="30ccd57bdb72d304a8562926ca961947.iix" /></p>
<p><strong>3)  Smart suggestion:  Tasks I *was* assigned to, but not currently</strong></p>
<p>This would be a big one for Service Desks... especially those measuring &#34;response&#34; by how fast its assigned to a human.  Most don&#39;t know that system is already tracking this (at least for Incidents)<br /><img src="cdfd55ffdb72d304a8562926ca9619cb.iix" /></p>
