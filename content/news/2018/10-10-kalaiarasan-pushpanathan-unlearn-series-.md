<p>This is super short blog that I am writing to share a small utility that I uploaded to share which I use occasionally. The out of box <strong>Export to XML </strong>allows us to export the updateset as a XML extract. This is a good feature while doing manual deployment but the XML file that gets generated from this button does not have a user friendly name<strong>. </strong>The utility that I have uploaded will allow you to export the updateset as XML with the name of the XML extract as the updateset name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This utility adds a button called <strong>&#39;Export to XML (Name)&#39; </strong>that functions same as the out of box<strong> &#39;</strong><strong>Export to XML&#39; </strong>button with the exception that the filename of the XML is same as the name of the updateset being exported. All the components that are part of this utility are custom and it does not change anything out of the box. Most of the scripts mimic or extend related out of the box scripts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Feel free to use this if you still use manual exporting of updateset as XML in your deployment process and leave any feedback if you like using it.</p>
