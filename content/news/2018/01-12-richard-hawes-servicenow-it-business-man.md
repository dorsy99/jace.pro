Through the Istanbul, Jakarta and now Kingston releases we've seen some amazing innovations and a new level of seamless integration that makes it simpler than ever to run IT more like a business unit.</p><p></p><p>In Kingston, we're driving significant usability enhancements and introducing major new features that make the most of the shared platform and data. Here are the key items in this release — we can't wait for you to dive into a Kingston instance to see all the other things we're delivering too!</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Project Portfolio Management <em>— Project Workspace</em>:</strong>   A new single-pane workspace includes a customizable landing page and aggregated project reporting and management functions. This is a great starting-page for project and portfolio managers balance their workload and will reduce the need for multi-screen navigation.</li></ul><p><img   alt="Kingston Project Workspace.png" class="image-1 jive-image" src="81861986dbd4d304b322f4621f961911.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;"/></p><ul><li><strong>Agile Development — <em>Sprint and Backlog Management</em>: </strong>We're ramping up our capabilities for<strong> </strong>agile environments through a new interface for easy sprint planning and drag-and-drop backlog management. The elevated functionality can help you eliminate 3<sup>rd</sup> party agile tools. One page provides access to story filters, epic filters, and drag-and-drop rankings.</li></ul><p><img   alt="Sprint Drag and Drop.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="25217006dbd8dfc03eb27a9e0f9619b4.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 56px;"/></p><ul><li><strong>Application Portfolio Management — <em>Capability Based Planning</em>:</strong> Understand the real value of your applications by relating the business application portfolio with strategic business capabilities. APM displays the hierarchy supporting a specific business capability and then helps you to map applications and technologies to that hierarchy. This extends the insights we're providing to help you rationalize your portfolio and focus investments in the right place.</li></ul><p><img   alt="Capability Planning.png" class="image-3 jive-image" src="b246e7f9db541fc068c1fb651f961914.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 340px;"/></p><ul><li><strong>Application Portfolio Management — <em>Technology Portfolio Management</em>:</strong> Calculates risks and technology debt for business applications to improve planning and further optimize spend. Relates technology lifecycles from General Availability through End-of-Life for supported business applications and leverages data from the new Software Asset Management product if available.</li></ul><p><img   alt="Kingston TPM.png" class="image-4 jive-image" src="04651502dbd4d304b322f4621f961937.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 338px;"/></p><ul><li><strong>Financial Planning — <em>Budgeting and Forecasting</em>:</strong> We're refocusing our financial tools to make the most of what you already have in ServiceNow. We're enhancing the ability to analyze budget and forecast data by multiple elements and time periods; including a grid interface that will be familiar to spreadsheet users and drag-and-drop selection for improved efficiency.</li></ul><p><img   alt="Kingston Budgeting.png" class="image-5 jive-image" src="a9b0bc06db98dfc068c1fb651f961997.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 339px;"/></p><p></p><p>IT Business Management is the only solution to bring all this capability together in a single platform that can also leverage what you are doing in Service and Operations Management and other applications in the Now Platform. This enables Strategic Portfolio Management which is essential for organizations going through any kind of transformation.
