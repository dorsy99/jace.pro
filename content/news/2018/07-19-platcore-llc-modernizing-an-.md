<p>What if your life depended on the training of your co-workers? Imagine that the view from your boardroom is a molten metal processing plant that, if run improperly, could mean your life, as well as the lives of hundreds of your co-workers. </p>
<p>All of this is to say that Novelis takes training very seriously. And while the safety of their workers is paramount, their expertise is second to none. The leading producer of flat-rolled aluminum products and the world’s largest recycler of aluminum, Novelis is a $10 billion company with 24 operating facilities in 10 countries.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The P</strong><strong>roblem</strong> </p>
<p>The Novelis Learning Management System (LMS) had been built by a third-party vendor that controlled the aged, custom, Flash-based system. This media company managed all access to the system. Provisioning (or worse, removing) users took days. Reporting on training data required exported spreadsheets and culling through hundreds of emails.  </p>
<p>Advancements in new aluminum technology, Novelis policies or procedures required redeploying courses that were locked away in this inaccessible system. As users were increasingly unable to access the Flash files, Novelis knew that they would need a modern solution. The lynchpin came when they determined that this current system had severe security flaws.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The</strong><strong> Solution</strong> </p>
<p>As a current ServiceNow customer, Novelis found that the PlatCore LMS immediately met their needs around security.  They soon realized the many benefits that PlatCore and the Now Platform would provide in managing their training, including: </p>
<ul><li>Easy to provision and manage </li><li>Cost and process efficiencies </li><li>Modern, user-friendly interface </li><li>World-class reporting and security </li><li>Access to real-time data </li></ul>
<p>For administrators, PlatCore provides real-time provisioning, reporting and delivery. Customizable dashboards allow administrators, executives and plant managers to quickly track their own individual KPIs. </p>

<p>For learners, PlatCore offers a modern user-interface with full mobile capabilities that allows users to access training anytime, anywhere. Because training is easier to access, learner adoption increases. With PlatCore, it is easy to update training to keep pace with the latest policies and procedures.</p>

<p><em>In short, they were going to gain control of their LMS. </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong> </p>
<p>A successful proof of concept quickly demonstrated that PlatCore provided an excellent foundation for their learning system out of the box. While Novelis is an existing ServiceNow customer, due to the need for business unit autonomy and governance, they choose to deploy a dedicated ServiceNow instance for their Learning Solution. This enables a smooth migration to the Novelis corporate ServiceNow environment in the future.  </p>
<p>Within a few months following the POC, a small task force from PlatCore and Novelis converted an amazing 5,028 videos for 261 courses in 7 languages. Once the videos were converted from Flash, the PlatCore bulk uploader automated course migration. The system currently supports 1,279 users in 31 locations, 10 countries and 4 continents. In addition, the team imported 15,900 course achievement records, instantly creating a training history that Novelis could use for reporting.  </p>
<p>The executive teams and plant managers now know exactly who, what, when and where training has been completed in real time. Additionally, the PlatCore system makes their training more proactive with notifications on expiring training, automated monthly training reports, and much more. </p>
<p>According to Stephanie Padilla, Training Process Owner with Novelis R &amp; D, &#34;Now, the data we need is at our fingertips immediately, where it used to take hours or month of combing through emails and paper files. And when audit time comes, it&#39;s as easy as point, click and print.&#34; </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Novelis finally has direct control of their training. The company no longer worries about the security of their training and can provision (or revoke) access in just a few clicks. Staff all over the world have access to courses that are easily updated. This means quick distribution of the most innovative, recent technologies, as well as current processes and procedures that will keep people safe. Executives, managers and co-workers alike can rest easy knowing that training is up-to-date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The PlatCore LMS has meant an exponential ROI for the company, but the real value is the safety of their people. And that’s what&#39;s most important. </p>
