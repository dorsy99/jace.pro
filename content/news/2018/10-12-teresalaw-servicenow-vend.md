<p>What do credit ratings, SecurityScorecard, and ServiceNow Vendor Risk Management have in common?</p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with credit ratings. When you attempt to buy a car or a house, the first thing the bank checks is your how well you’re managing your money. The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to get a loan. SecurityScorecard does the same thing — only it measures how well businesses are managing their cybersecurity posture and calculates a letter-grade security rating. Why is this important? Companies with a C, D, or F security rating are 5.4 times more likely to be breached or face compliance penalties than companies with an A or B rating.</p>
<p><strong>ServiceNow and SecurityScorecard Tackle Vendor Risk</strong></p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that SecurityScorecard now offers an integration with ServiceNow Vendor Risk Management, providing a comprehensive view of vendor security performance.
