<p>I&#39;m honored to announce the nine enterprise SaaS product startups that have been selected to the short list for this year&#39;s <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/creatorconchallenge" rel="nofollow">CreatorCon Challenge</a>. These developer-entrepreneurs are in the vanguard of native application development on the Now Platform and were selected by a voting panel of senior ServiceNow Ventures, Now Platform, and ISV/Technology Alliances executives.</p>
<p>From well over 300 individual entries, 50 warranted closer scrutiny for full eligibility, and 20 made it through as fully eligible to short list consideration. It was an in depth, hands-on one month evaluation process to get from the entry deadline to the shortlist. The eligibility requirements are strict - setting a high bar in terms of entity, app, and entry materials characteristics and quality. The work put in by not only the shortlist but all 20 who met the full eligibility requirements is immense, notwithstanding that they have businesses to run as their day job - and all deserve our appreciation and kudos. </p>
<p>The short list is part of the ServiceNow developer community - they&#39;re one of you.</p>
<p>Your CreatorCon Challenge 2018 shortlist is (in alphabetical order):</p>
