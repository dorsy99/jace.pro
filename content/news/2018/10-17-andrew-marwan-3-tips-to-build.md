<p>Simply put, a KPI (key performance indicator) should help you and your team understand whether you’re taking the right path toward your strategic goals. But how do you know whether your KPI is <em>really</em> building that understanding?  There are 3 key steps to assessing whether or not your KPI is on point.</p>
<p>A first step comes before you pick your KPIs:  you should take the time to assess ServiceNow as it relates to your company’s Digital Transformation goals.</p>
<p><img src="a2b13ef7db01a3402be0a851ca96192b.iix" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ask your team to help you define or understand your organization’s vision for ServiceNow. What business outcomes do you expect to deliver? What are your plans for delivering these outcomes over time? This makes it possible to define a credible set of KPIs that, when used together, can directly measure progress and indicate whether you are on the right outcome path to value.</p>
<p>A key second step is to make sure you understand the levers you have to influence the KPI. Let’s take speed-of-resolution as an example. If resolution times for incidents are lagging – and first-call resolution rates are going down – do you have a clear sense of how to diagnose the root cause of the lag, or how to solve it?”.</p>
<p>A third consideration is the number of KPIs you decide to track. Often, each ServiceNow stakeholder is given the opportunity to suggest which KPIs they want to track, which are reviewed by a larger group or committee. This can result in a basket of too many KPIs, diluting your reviews and analysis. Instead, select fewer KPIs:   target five as a goal, to really focus your analysis. Over time, KPIs can be added as long as they align with your company’s Digital Transformation objectives.</p>
