<p>Customer app ratings &amp; reviews are an important form of reference selling (do you look at customer reviews before buying something on Amazon?) and can be instrumental in converting visitors to your Store page into leads. Ratings and reviews on the ServiceNow Store are from real, named customers and are authenticated by ServiceNow.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To drive more customer ratings &amp; reviews, we are making the following changes starting towards the end of Q1:<br /><br /></p>
<ol><li>New Default Sort by Rating view on the Store home page - apps that have the highest ratings will be displayed at the top of the default Store home page view and sorted in descending order followed by the latest apps with no ratings.</li><li>To be eligible for Featured status, apps must now have at least one four or five star rating with an accompanying review in addition to the existing criteria (paid/rev-share, on latest ServiceNow release).</li></ol>
<p><br />Call to action:<br /><br />Please actively solicit ratings and reviews from your happy customers and get those published to your app page on the Store.  There are two ways for you to request a customer to rate and review your app - please see the <a href="https://tpp.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/tpp/help?article&#61;KB0030025" rel="nofollow">Store Publisher Portal -&gt; Help -&gt; Rating and Reviews</a> or use the attached form  - it is handy for <strong>soliciting reviews from buyers/decision makers at your customer that do not have HI credentials. </strong> In addition, the Store automatically sends an email request to the customer upon procuring your app, to rate and review your app.</p>
<p><br />Please email store.business&#64;servicenow.com if you have any questions about app reviews or leave a comment below. </p>
