<p>Your organization has chosen ServiceNow to be the strategic platform for digital transformation but, chances are, there’s going to be resistance to adoption. Who can help ease the fears of change and provide feedback from the field back to the ServiceNow project team?</p>
<p>Champions are important because they help inform implementation planning and activities with an understanding of what people in the organization need to be able to effectively adopt ServiceNow. But what are the responsibilities of your Champions and how do you train them?</p>
<p>To help with this, we’ve highlighted four questions to consider when understanding the ServiceNow Champion role:</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>1. “What is a ServiceNow Champion?”</strong></h4>
<p>ServiceNow Champions are people from different teams and roles (e.g. team leads, process users, users, etc.) who are affected by the ServiceNow implementation and who are willing to help make your ServiceNow project more successful. Champions understand the nuances in culture and specific needs that are unique to their teams and provide that insight to the ServiceNow project team. They are also well positioned to convey information from the ServiceNow project team back to their peers because they are trusted insiders.</p>
