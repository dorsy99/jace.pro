<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s hard enough to serve 15,000 students, not to mention their respective parents. It&#39;s even harder to do so consistently and at a level that matches the quality of the education being offered when the inquiries cover such a vast array of needs including financial aid, student registration, and student billing. The challenge is compounded when the services are provided independent of each other, in silos, despite ultimately serving the same end-users. </p>
<p>Catering to what equates to a small yet active town, the need to consolidate the student data while making it readily available to the staff whenever a student engages their services was key. The goals were clear but not without challenges:</p>
<ul><li>Consolidate three interdependent offices into on synchronized center. </li><li>Improve the student experience and overall customer satisfaction. </li><li>Optimize how student inquiries are routed and documented. </li><li>Empower the university staff to solve inquires faster while sharing relevant information across departments seamlessly. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Sound Familiar?</strong></p>
<p>The need to consolidate resources and departments to drive a more efficient and optimized operation is neither unique nor restricted to the higher-education space; quite the contrary. As technology continuously evolves, the need to improve the way we work to keep up with growing customer service expectations requires flexible and intuitive solutions that improve the flow of information and data, helping to better serve end-users, enhance the overall relationship, and drive successful and meaningful engagements at the time they occur. Whether operating a university or customer support group for a large enterprise, the above challenges apply universally and across industries. </p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of the university, the ability to share information, historical details, follow-up actions, and determine the best triage was key to optimizing service for the student and/or parent initiating the request. The approach to solving the issues was leveraging ServiceNow&#39;s Customer Management (CSM) offering, ServiceNow&#39;s OpenFrame, and 3CLogic&#39;s certified Now Platform workflow solution (one for data and the other for communication). </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is OpenFrame?</strong></p>
<p>ServiceNow Openframe is a module natively available in ServiceNow, which offers developers (e.g. ServiceNow administrators, ISVs, etc.) an API-enabled window to introduce external functionality seamlessly into the ServiceNow user environment. In the case of 3CLogic, OpenFrame was used to create a Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) and complementary ServiceNow communication platform, which provides a single user-interface for agents to manage all customer engagements, both incoming and outgoing (i.e. click-to-call, etc.) without leaving the ServiceNow platform. <br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px;" src="c42a9322db869f044816f3231f96190a.iix" /></p>
<p>For the university, integrated CTI allowed agents to efficiently handle incoming calls for students, parents, and staff while retaining easy access to important data hosted in ServiceNow (i.e. Case information, student details, etc.); no more non-integrated desk phones or siloed discussions outside of the primary system of record. </p>
<p><strong>Why integrate an IVR with ServiceNow?</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of having a deep knowledge of your customer or Cases if the information is not readily available to determine who the most qualified and skilled agent is to help the individual and ultimately connect them? With a fully-embedded Integrated Voice Response (IVR) system, the ability to route incoming inquiries to the appropriate department of representative, based on known details hosted in ServiceNow, is made easy. Built inside of ServiceNow, the 3CLogic IVR is natively embedded and administratively accessible from within the ServiceNow platform through its use of ServiceNow&#39;s UI Pages. <br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px;" src="47aa57a6db869f044816f3231f961969.iix" /></p>
<p>In the case of the university, the joint application of an IVR with ServiceNow allowed for the centralization of departments and a consolidated move to a single platform (in this case to working as one), ultimately helping to unify departments, facilitate information sharing between teams, and drive operational efficiencies. </p>
<p><strong>How to Enhance Visibility Into Customer Engagements?</strong></p>
<p>Visibility into what drives successful or challenging customer interactions is key to proactively staying in tune with what determines an enterprise&#39;s customer satisfaction score (otherwise known as client retention or loyalty). With 3CLogic, all contact center data (e.g. result code, notes, call type, etc.) is mapped back to ServiceNow for future reference and use. As such, the data is available for native reporting using ServiceNow&#39;s internal framework to connect metrics from both solutions without the time consuming need to export and externally combine the two. Thats right, no more excel sheets and and more time to spend evaluating the results rather than building them and pushing a button to generate. <br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px;" src="a6fa932adb869f044816f3231f96192e.iix" /></p>
<p>In the future, 3CLogic plans to allow for the layering of sentiment analysis - which <a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/15/1503443/0/en/3CLogic-Wins-ServiceNow-Knowledge18-CreatorCon-Hackathon.html" rel="nofollow">won us the trophy in ServiceNow Knowledge18 Hackathon</a> competition -  to provide greater insight into the quality of customer interactions, enabling agents to improve responsiveness to exceed customer expectations, while giving supervisors an unbiased and real-time view of the emotion of clients being served. </p>
<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>
<p>With the joint deployment of 3CLogic&#39;s integrated call center solution and ServiceNow&#39;s CSM platform, the university was able to:</p>
<ul><li>Create a more streamlined customer experience with optimized call routes and designated queues. </li><li>Save time and cost by consolidating three departments into one unified help center. </li><li>Improve visibility into what drives better customer engagements by providing data and reports. </li></ul>
