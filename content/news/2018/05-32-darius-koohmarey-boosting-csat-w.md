<p>For those at Knowledge18, you may have glimpsed the upcoming London Walk-up Experience application during either the IT Keynote or one of the speaker breakout sessions. For those not at the event, you may be looking for more information- or more likely, unaware of this great new application that was introduced in London &amp; enhanced in Madrid with the ITSM suite.</p>
<p>At a high level, this application enables &#39;genius bar&#39; style functionality for your service management organization, inspired by consumer interfaces found in our day to day lives. From an online check-in and appointment scheduling commonly found at haircutters, to the visual queues found in pizza stores, or the three button CSAT survey found at airports, the walk-up experience utilizes friendly Service Portal UI&#39;s for it&#39;s requester touch points. Walk-up fulfillers can easily pull users from their relevant queues and fulfill the walk-up with the appropriate incident, request, or consumable asset.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<p>Satisfaction with IT is dropping from rising expectations and current walk-ups have no formal process. Customers are looking for a quick way to implement a delightful walk-up service experience.</p>
<p>Users are expecting faster, consumerized service. Customers looking to implement walk-up today require customizations to their instance and make best guesses at how to manage demand and fulfillment at a walk-up.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong></p>
<p>The Walk-up Experience is a prebuilt ITSM application that includes the necessary requestor &amp; fulfiller functions to quickly implement a delightful ‘Walk-up’ contact channel for your service department. It includes the touch points for end users such as online check-in, appointment scheduling, and onsite check-in and queues, while also including routing and agent interfaces for the fulfillment of walk-up interactions. Not to mention that most configurations are done quickly with fields on a form rather than code! Customers can quickly brand this channel as a inclusive &#39;Service Lounge&#39;, &#39;Tech Lounge&#39;, &#39;Genius Center&#39;, etc. available to all users in the business.</p>
<p><strong>Value to Business:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Improve Business User (Requester) CSAT &amp; Productivity</li><li>Improve Technician Productivity</li><li>Quick to implement, easy to upgrade</li><li>Delighting requestor experiences prebuilt on Service Portal</li><li>Utilization &amp; Operational reporting</li></ul>

<p>The attached document was written to help provide guidance and information regarding the Madrid Walk-Up Experience (first version available in London). It is intended to help your organization understand, prepare for, and ultimately champion adopting a formal walk-up contact channel for IT. While this solution is commonly implemented for IT support, the technology can easily be extended for uses for HR (benefits season, anyone?), Facilities, and beyond.</p>
