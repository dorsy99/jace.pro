The London release of ServiceNow brings a number of new features designed to improve the ease of use of Security Operations. The biggest new developments include a new user interface for Security Incident Response and Setup Assistant to make deployment and configuration simpler for Security Incident Response and Vulnerability Response.</div>
<h3>Security Incident Response New UI</h3>
<p>The new user interface (UI) for Security Incident Response focuses on making investigation and response faster for the security analyst, especially those who aren’t familiar with using ServiceNow. From the initial security incident landing page, the new UI makes it easier to view open incidents with the peek view. In the screenshot below, you can see all of the open incidents currently assigned to this analyst sorted by risk score. With peek view, each incident can be expanded without leaving the page to see more detail about the incident.</p>

<p>The security incident detail page features a configurable tile-based interface that shows all of the relevant information needed to quickly investigate a threat. It’s also easy to switch from investigation to containment tasks with the tabbed layout.</p>
<p>Another new addition are security playbooks. These are always available on the right side of the security incident detail page and guide a security analyst through response tasks step-by-step. As each task is completed, the next item appears with instructions.</p>

<p>The classic Security Incident Response interface is also still available in London.</p>
<h3>Setup Assistant</h3>
<p>Because Security Operations uses a number of different integrations, configuration and setup has sometimes been challenging for customers. This is why we’re introducing Setup Assistant for both Security Incident Response and Vulnerability Response to make managing these tasks easier. It guides you through tasks ranging from the initial plugin installation to setting user roles to configuring calculators and integrations.</p>
<p>Setup Assistant can be used beyond initial deployment, however. As time goes on, you may need to add new integrations or change settings on your current integrations. Setup Assistant provides an easy guide for making these adjustments.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things you can do with Setup Assistant:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>    Security Incident Response</strong>
<ul><li>Assign a Security Incident Administrator</li><li>User and group management</li><li>Plugin installation</li><li>Process setup: SLA, risk score calculator  </li><li>Email inbox and parsing rules</li><li>Playbook settings and triggers</li><li>Integration setup</li></ul>
</td><td><strong>   </strong></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>    Vulnerability Response</strong>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>
<p>Vulnerability Response receives a number of additional enhancements, including support for multiple vulnerability scanners and improvements to how newly-discovered configuration items are handled. It also adds more ways to create vulnerability groups and Remediation Target Rules, which adds service level agreement-like capabilities to individual vulnerable items.</p>
<p>Security Incident Response adds domain separation for integrations, ideal for large organizations and managed security services providers, and improved support for forwarded phishing emails.</p>
