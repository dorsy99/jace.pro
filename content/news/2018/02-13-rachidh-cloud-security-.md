<p>As a ServiceNow customer, you have control over the security of your instance and your data within the ServiceNow cloud. You have the ability to control specific security settings within the instance that enable you to harden the application and platform settings to meet your unique security needs. You can choose from several data-at-rest encryption options, manage application-level role based access controls, and authentication mechanisms, and you are also permitted to conduct an application-level penetration test against your sub-production instance every year. We believe security is a shared responsibility between ServiceNow and our customers.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3"><li>Apply patches to your instance. ServiceNow gives its customers the flexibility to apply patches at their discretion to allow for any impact to functionality, but patches should be applied as quickly after their release as possible. The <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0549676" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0549676" rel="nofollow">Quarterly Patching Program</a> schedules patches in intervals throughout the year to make sure that your instance is up-to-date with the latest security, performance, and availability. ServiceNow supports the current release (N) and the two most recent previous releases (N-1 and N-2). Older versions are unsupported and are not usually patched or hot-fixed. Instances on versions earlier than (N-2) must upgrade, or ServiceNow will initiate a forced upgrade. If you are on a version earlier than N-2 you are putting your instance at risk.</li></ol>
</li><li>As discussed above, ServiceNow allows customers to perform an annual penetration test. Plan your penetration test by following the procedure outlined <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0538598" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0538598" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Because we allow all of our customers to perform a penetration test, this is equivalent to a crowd penetration test that helps improve the Now Platform at rapid scale! Of course, ServiceNow also has an internal functional penetration testing program, as well as a third party penetration testing program. Because we like customer to continuously innovate with ServiceNow, some functional testing are always possible that enables customers to test their integrations with ServiceNow without performing a full pen test. This can be done continuously, not just once per year: See <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0621831" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0621831" rel="nofollow">&#34;Customer Functional validation testing&#34;</a></li><li>Communication between ServiceNow&#39;s security team and our customers&#39; security teams is important to make sure any major security-related information can be disseminated quickly and efficiently. To that end, please make sure there is a designated security contact for your company listed in HI <a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0635608#inci" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0635608#inci" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li><li>Apply general security controls in your own environment to prevent credential theft and such</li><li>Monitor your instance regularly — review system logs, restrict admin accounts</li></ol>
