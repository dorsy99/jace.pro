<p>Most HR professionals want to make things “Easy for Employees.” But what is it that you’d like to make easy, exactly? Health care sign-ups, benefit information, the hiring processes?</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>If you&#39;re attending this week&#39;s HR Tech Conference in Las Vegas, here&#39;s your chance to flex those creative muscles and have some fun. You can participate in the conversation in a few ways:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li><a href="https://twitter.com/servicenow" rel="nofollow">Follow ServiceNow on Twitter</a>!</li><li>Visit the ServiceNow booth and snap a photo of yourself.</li><li>Think about your answer to this question: What should be made easy for employees?</li><li>Share this thought, along with your photo and the hashtags #HRTechConf and #EasyForEmployees, to Twitter or Instagram.</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only will we include your picture in the mosaic wall being assembled in the ServiceNow booth, but you might even leave Las Vegas with a prize! We’ll be on site at the ServiceNow booth during show hours, ready to help. Now that’s what we call “easy.”</p>
