<p>The <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/134223" rel="nofollow">Joint Accreditation Board (JAB)</a>, which granted ServiceNow’s platform certification in February 2016, has confirmed that SAM meets the strict technical requirements necessary for government related entities to utilize it in the cloud. As the certification allows SAM to be hosted in the FedRAMP dedicated datacenter, federal customers will benefit from the same security and access controls that they currently experience.</p>

<p>The Making Electronic Government Accountable By Yielding Tangible Efficiencies (MEGABYTE) Act was signed into law on August 1, 2016, tasking CIOs of government related entities to develop software licensing policies, maintain inventories of software licenses and understand software license usage, with the intent of defining and tracking towards IT spend savings. ServiceNow Software Asset Management provides government agencies with the out of box capabilities to meet these requirements, while increasing IT operational efficiency and further reducing operating costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ServiceNow Software Asset Management provides customers with insight into the entire software lifecycle. Real time compliance reporting is supported for thousands of software titles, in addition to in depth analysis for current publisher packs: Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and VMware.  Organizations can track end user software usage, highlighting cost savings opportunities to reclaim unused or sparsely used software.</p>

<p>The ServiceNow team is excited to extend this offering to our valued federal customers.</p>
