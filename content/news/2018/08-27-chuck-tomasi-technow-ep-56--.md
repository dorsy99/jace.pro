These integrations, known as spokes are easy to configure and enable you to quickly add powerful actions without the need to write script.</p>
<p>Join Kreg Steppe - Sr. Curriculum Developer, Chuck Tomasi - Sr. TPMM, and Stacey Bailey – Principal Curriculum Developer, for a lesson in building custom spokes to go beyond the standard ServiceNow integrations. Create reusable blocks of code that non-developers can use in Flow Designer to quickly build powerful solutions.</p>

<p>Questions from the live stream:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>is that part of the platform?</strong> -- Jared johnson<br /> REST API Explorer? If that&#39;s what you&#39;re referencing, it sure is. To play with the REST API Explorer, go to any list, right-click on a column and Configure &gt; Table. In the Related Links, you&#39;ll see an option to &#34;Explore REST API.&#34; Click that and have fun. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Where was that encyrption whitepaper?</strong> -- Ben Blackburn<br /> https://www.servicenow.com/nonstop-cloud.html --- bottom of the page. ServiceNow Trust ebook. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>I cannot find the slack spoke in my instance, how do I get that spoke</strong> -- Kevin Mauriello<br /> Slack requires the IntergrationHub license. If you want to explore it for free, you can get a personal developer instance at developer.servicenow.com and try it out. For information on licensing, please discuss with your account team. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>I have a personal instance, what plugin do i need to activate for integration hub</strong> -- Kevin Mauriello<br /> From the developer portal, go to the Manage&gt; Instance menu and use the Action menu to turn on the IntegrationHub plugin -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can we configure email inbound action in flow designer?</strong> -- Kavitha Raydurga<br /> I think this is feasible. London introduces the ability to trigger a flow via script. You should be able to call that script from the inbound action. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Will we get a recording of this session to review back to?</strong> -- Timothy Haroutunian<br /> Yes. They will be posted to the community at http://bit.ly/servicenow-technow in a few days. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is the recommendation to convert some of the existing workflows to use flow designer ?</strong> -- Naveen Chakilam<br /> I wouldn&#39;t expect most customers to go through the labor of converting legacy workflows to Flow Designer. There&#39;s really no need if the existing workflow is working for you. The legacy workflow is not going away, it just isn&#39;t receiving any additional enhancements or updates. If you have net-new work to do (start a new workflow) then I strongly urge you to consider using Flow Designer. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>does a scoped app have to be created when creating a new spoke/using the integration hub</strong> -- Kevin Mauriello<br /> Yes -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Will it support Scoped HR when we are required to use Spoke Application ?</strong> -- Vimal Priya S<br /> Yes. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>are you in kingston?</strong> -- Jared johnson<br /> That screenshot was from London. The AD spokes were introduced in that version. You can check all of the London spokes out in a personal developer instance. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Can I get documentation about MID server?</strong> -- Daniel Rosales<br /> Yes. You can find more information on our docs site here. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/product/mid-server/reference/r-MIDServer.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>What are best practices for something like the example in this demo using business rules and workflows vs using Flow Designer.</strong> -- Michael Rakowski<br /> I&#39;ve become of the mind that you should start thinking of Flow Designer first before defaulting to Business Rules and graphical Workflow. In a recent exercise, I replaced about 150 lines of code with a simple Flow. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Will you be able to expand that spoke? Or do we need to recreate our own?</strong> -- Timothy Haroutunian<br /> There are options to copy existing actions, which should allow you to copy and make your own. The protection policies will likely prevent you from expandinb base instance actions, though. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Do you guys have any lab for doing this?</strong> -- Dopdyel Tseten<br /> I&#39;ve got a couple of labs written for the Platform Implementation training class to create custom actions. I&#39;ve got a no-code option and a coding option. I&#39;ll look around for other options to get experience with custom actions as well and include those in the show notes. Also, you can reverse-engineer the actions included in the platform. That approach is excellent for learning. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Does it commit updates when Testing the Flow or just show what results would be?</strong> -- Dennis Magnuson<br /> Yes, test results are saved/committed. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can this be installed and tried on a lower instance to try out? Or does it have to be a personal instance?</strong> -- Kevin Owens<br /> As long as you&#39;re running Kingston or London, you can try this out on a lower instance in your stack. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Is Integration Hub and Flow Designer under Orchestration Licensing? or generally available on the platform (eg. standard ITSM base licensing)?</strong> -- Tim Towstego<br /> Flow Designer is a platform capability available with no additional subscriptions included. ITSM actions are available directly in that. Check with your sales rep about IntegrationHub licensing if you currently have Orchestration and want to use IntegrationHub capabilities. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Ohh yes i found that as &#34;ServiceNow IntegrationHub Installer&#34;Thanks</strong> -- Anubhav Kapoor<br /> Excellent! Enjoy exploring IntegrationHub. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Can I get a link to the REST API explorer episode?</strong> -- Dustin Spain<br /> Sure Dustin. https://community.servicenow.com/community?id&#61;community_question&amp;sys_id&#61;d0da8a3ddb7597004837f3231f96196a -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>flow esigner would be like Nintex?</strong> -- saritha kannaiahgari<br /> In a sense. This is a drag-n-drop UI to build workflows similar to IFTTT or Zapier. I took a quick look at Nintext, so I assume so. Flow Designer is built in directly to the ServiceNow platform to work across the enterprise. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>What are the performance implications of the designer over traditional methods?</strong> -- Michael Rakowski<br /> None that I&#39;m aware of. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Will you see these triggers that are created from Flow designer from the table -&gt; configure all (Business Rules, Client Scripts, etc) or do you have to go to Flow designer/Studio to see these items?</strong> -- Christopher Martineau<br /> Flows are configured via the Flow Designer menu or via Studio. They do not show up on Configure&gt; All as there is a graphical element to it. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Off topic - Where to I get tutorials about London that would prepare me for the new delta certification non-proctored test.</strong> -- Edward Parker<br /> I recommend contacting our training department to get full information on that. training&#64;servicenow.com -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Will you cover how to use the ForEach. I will have a question if you do.</strong> -- Timothy Haroutunian<br /> I don&#39;t think Kreg&#39;s example has a For Each use case as he&#39;s only getting and setting one record. If we don&#39;t get to it, you can always ask in the community at community.servicenow.com -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>how can you use nested JSON as query parameters ?</strong> -- Dopdyel Tseten<br /> I haven&#39;t seen nested JSON as a query parameter requirement yet. Usually more complex data types are done in the request body (for post/patch/put modes.) That being said, you could stringify it and add it to the query parameters and hopefully not overload the URL. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>like easy to drag and drp to desing</strong> -- saritha kannaiahgari<br /> Yes, it&#39;s a wonderfully intuitive interface. The Developer portal just released a Flow Designer course last week you may enjoy: https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/training/article/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_kingston_flow_designer/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_kingston_flow_designer_objectives?v&#61;kingston -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Is Integration Hub available on Personal Developer instance?</strong> -- Anubhav Kapoor<br /> Yes. When you go to the Manage menu to manage your instance, you can choose Activate a plugin from the Action menu, locate IntegrationHub and turn it on. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Could you show us a demo using MID Server and Rest service?</strong> -- Daniel Rosales<br /> Hi Daniel, while REST via MID server on IntegrationHub is available on London, we likely won&#39;t have time to cover that today. Suffice it to say, you can do it. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is there a way to convert data-types? As in read in an integer and convert it to a float, in order to output a decimal number...</strong> -- Rick Cloud<br /> Yes, you would do that with a script step using standard Javascript operations like parseInt() or parseFloat() or toString(). -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is the flow designer new to London or is it in Jakarta and Kingston</strong> -- Jed Blanks<br /> Flow Designer was introduced in Kingston. There have been some enhancements added in London such as sub-flows, phases, and annotations. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>link to available integrations?</strong> -- Jared johnson<br /> You can find more information here. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/spokes-list.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is there any known plans for a VSO spoke?</strong> -- Levi Dempsey<br /> None that I am aware of, but you can always keep an eye on our docs page. With each release there is new information. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/spokes-list.html -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is it possible to reuse same actions in Flow designer?</strong> -- Kavitha Raydurga<br /> Absolutely! That&#39;s the idea. There&#39;s a ton of power embedded in the Action Designer that allows you to develop easy-to-use reusable actions. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Is this being recorded for later viewing?</strong> -- Rick Cloud<br /> Yes. We will email you the link to the on-demand webinar shortly after today&#39;s session. Thanks for joining us. -- Brandy Rowden<br /><br /></p>
