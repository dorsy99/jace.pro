<p>During this VIP session for customers only, they learned what is coming in future releases of HRSD as well as got to hear from others using HRSD to consumerize the employee experience and drive efficient HR service delivery in their organization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Customers were provided an opportunity to network with other HR professionals in their area, share best practices, hear from the HR BU on its strategy and product roadmap and get a sneak-peak into the London release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One customer told us: “I’ve been to many of the local ServiceNow sessions/SNUGs and this is the first one that I am walking out with actionable information applicable to me as an HR customer – this was a great event.”</p>
