<h3><strong>What is the Employee Service Center, and what services are commonly offered?</strong></h3>
<p>The Employee Service Center is built on the Service Portal framework, and it is designed to serve as a one stop shop for employees to get the information and services they need. Here’s a sampling of commonly offered services:</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Company or cross enterprise information</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Company or cross enterprise information can be provided to employees, and personalized to their needs. This content can be targeted to users based on information in their profiles such as location, role, etc., and may include:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;"><li><ul><li>Announcements,</li><li>Event and holiday calendars,</li><li>Training materials and videos, etc.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Knowledge Bases</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A knowledge base (or bases) can provide users with the opportunity to self-serve. By searching for and finding the answers to their questions, users may save time and not need to make HR requests. User criteria can be defined at the knowledge base and article level, so users can access only the content appropriate or applicable to them.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>HR Communications Channels</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Users may have options to communicate with HR, such as chatting with a live agent.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Case and task information</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A case is created when an HR service is requested through the Employee Service Center. Cases are automatically assigned to the appropriate agents to receive support.</p>

<h3>What are the options for configuring the Employee Service Center?</h3>
<p>The Employee Service Center is fully functional in the base system for quicker time-to-value. To configure the content for your organization’s needs, you can customize the existing example content. You can also define criteria that will filter the content so that it will appear for the targeted audience.</p>
<p>To customize the portal’s look and feel, you can use the <strong>Service Portal Branding Editor</strong>.</p>
