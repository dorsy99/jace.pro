<p style="text-align: left;">With over 18,000 attendees expected at Knowledge 18, registrations are being booked faster than an 11,000 horsepower Top Fuel Dragster racing down the drag strip. For ServiceNow diehards, the excitement is building for the opportunity to reconnect with <a href="https://twitter.com/fred_luddy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fred Luddy</a>. Yes, it&#39;s true that our beloved founder will be in attendance this year as a judge for the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/company/ventures/creatorcon-challenge.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$1M CreatorCon Challenge</a>. Back in 2004, it was Fred&#39;s vision to build a cloud-based platform that would enable regular people to route work effectively through an enterprise and as a result ServiceNow was born. This past January, our CEO John Donahoe surprised the audience at our Sales Kickoff by bringing Fred Luddy to the stage and the energy in the room skyrocketed. During the interview, it was amazing to see just how humbled Fred was that his vision has benefited thousands of companies as the foundation of their digital transformation journeys.</p>

<p>When we think about digital transformation, it is commonplace to first think about our personal lives where we are surrounded by technology that for the most part makes our lives easier. With just a few taps, at anytime from anywhere, we can make a reservation at our favorite restaurant, invite our friends to join us, schedule a ride to take us there, and pay the bill all from a common platform. From that same platform, we can set our home alarm system, adjust the thermostat, and close the garage all while sitting in our chair at the restaurant. What I&#39;ve just described provides a delightful experience and ultimately makes the consumer world work better for people.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve come to expect delightful experiences in our personal lives so why shouldn&#39;t we expect the same experiences at work? Digital transformations in the workplace are running wild, with new systems being introduced on a rapid pace and little is being done to integrate these systems together. As workers, we get frustrated because we need to remember which system to use for each purpose, and each system has a different and sometimes complex user interface. As a result, workers are becoming overwhelmed, unproductive and dissatisfied with continuous poor experiences. </p>

<p><strong>Attending Knowledge ignited my passion for ServiceNow and sparked our Transformation...</strong></p>
<p>Prior to joining ServiceNow, I spent 3 and 1/2 years as a customer where I was the platform owner and process lead. I had just joined my company a month before going to Knowledge 13 and my understanding of ServiceNow at that time was that it was just a cloud-based ITSM tool. In spending most of my career in corporate IT roles, I&#39;d been to countless technology conferences and none of them offered the learning and networking opportunities I experienced at a ServiceNow Knowledge conference. But what really stood out to me was the sky-high level of enthusiasm by attendees and I had to find out why. After speaking with many customers, the answer was the same across the board - &#34;ServiceNow makes everyone&#39;s lives easier and we are forever grateful to Fred Luddy for building such an amazing platform.&#34; By the end of the conference, I realized that the platform I would be owning was game-changing for my company and I could not wait to get back to work and get started with mapping our transformation!</p>
