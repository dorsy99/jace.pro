<p>This is another super short blog that I am writing to share a small utility that I uploaded to share which would be useful for your day-day tasks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The out of box <strong>&#39;Show Related Record&#39;</strong> is great for viewing the actual record related to updates captured in the updateset. This button is good but it takes us away from the current window and redirects us to the related record. This gets annoying many times and we do not have any feature to view multiple update related records at the same time. This Share item adds 2 custom buttons that will help you quickly open the update related record in a new window. &#39;<strong>Open In New Window</strong>&#39; will help you open one record in a new window and &#39;<strong>Open Updates</strong>&#39; button that is available on list choice will help you open multiple records at the same time. </p>
