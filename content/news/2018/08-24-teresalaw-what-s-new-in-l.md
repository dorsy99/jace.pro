<p>It’s hard to argue with common sense. However, many times the initial tiering process is not given the attention it deserves. We sought to change that in the London release with a specific focus on helping you obtain the information necessary to more accurately tier your vendors. And because increasing performance is something we strive to help you achieve, we automated many of the steps from tiering score calculation to sending out the proper vendor risk assessment.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the new tiering features:</p>
<ol><li>A formalized vendor tiering process</li><li>Integration with security score providers</li></ol>
<p><strong>A formalized vendor tiering process</strong></p>
<p>Your organization may have hundreds of vendors, but only a select group pose a serious risk to the business. Risks may include acting as a gateway for attackers to sensitive information or handicapping or crippling operations if a partner provided good or service becomes unavailable. You know you need to be vigilant about regularly assessing the risk posed by these critical or tier 1 vendors. But first you need to accurately identify them. </p>
<p>ServiceNow Governance, Risk, and Compliance has added a formal process for internal stakeholders to assess the criticality of vendors through internal assessments. Some of the enhancement you’ll find in London are:</p>
<ul><li>An updated Vendor Risk Dashboard</li><li>New navigator options under Vendor Risk</li><li>Internal tiering assessments to be used during on-boarding</li><li>Automated tiering score calculations to streamline the process of determining the vendor tier</li><li>A new field in the vendor record “vendor tier” and a new related list that is automatically updated</li><li>Tier-based submission rules to automate the task of sending the vendor assessment to the affected vendors when an initial tier is calculated, or a review shows a tier change</li><li>Tiering score ranges that are fully configuration</li></ul>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="18ca15a6db48ef04a39a0b55ca96194b.iix" /><em>A new workflow, reports, and updates to the vendor record make managing the tiering process easier</em></p>
<p>By formalizing a tiering process to identify critical vendors then initiating the appropriate level and frequency of assessments, you can better control the risk posed by your vendors.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The new tiering capabilities are available to any customer with an existing license.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with security score providers</strong></p>
<p>You have extensive knowledge of what information your vendors have access to and how critical the vendor is to the operation of your business. However, you can’t know everything about your vendor’s risk posture, such as their security performance (number of security incidents or breaches) – that’s where companies that collect third-party risk metrics can help.</p>
<p>ServiceNow GRC has provided integrations with Security Score vendors <a href="https://www.bitsighttech.com/" rel="nofollow">BitSight </a>(with <a href="https://verterim.com/" rel="nofollow">Verterim</a>) and <a href="https://instant.securityscorecard.com/?gclid&#61;CjwKCAjwtvnbBRA5EiwAcRvnpsjVFOV91csc-sOSJ-pzMeHtHN_UUviqrd6m3X4GshbnBNl0jcqLuhoCXUEQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow">Security Scorecard</a> to allow you to get a third-party view of the security performance of your vendors. You can also create your own internal metrics to integrate with. This additional data allows you to fine-tune a vendor’s tier, if necessary, to more accurately reflect the true risk posed by the vendor. The vendor tier dictates the type and frequency of risk assessments. If changes occur to the security score, automated workflows can immediately send out a new vendor assessment.</p>
<p>Some enhancements you’ll see in the product are:</p>
<ul><li>New navigator options under Vendor Risk</li><li>New fields in the vendor record for “Security score” and “Score provider” that are automatically updated</li><li>A new related list for Security Scores in the vendor record</li><li>A new table to list security score providers and another to list the scores</li><li>Security score rules to automatically send a vendor risk assessment based on a security score change</li></ul>

<p><em>Reacting quickly to changes in your vendors security posture is essential to a robust vendor risk program</em></p>
<p>BitSight and Security Scorecard applications are available for a fee on the <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/search?category&#61;Governance%252C%2520Risk%2520and%2520Compliance&amp;orderby&#61;rating" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Store</a> to customers with existing licenses. Security Scorecard also offers a free trial. Accounts are required from the security score providers.</p>
<p><strong>Support in London for the SOX Content Pack</strong></p>
<p>On July 19, 2018 we introduced a <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/2e03fe8013705b40e94b721a6144b098/5.0.1?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fq%3Dsox" rel="nofollow">SOX content pack</a> to kick start your SOX program and help reduce the burden for internal IT and external auditors when doing SOX audits. The application is on the ServiceNow store. Please be sure to select the version that matches your release – one version is for Jakarta and one is for Kingston. The Kingston version will be updated to also include London, which will be available at or shortly after the release of London.</p>
<p>The content pack includes new out-of-the-box content: templates, indicators, and reporting specific for SOX compliance; that ServiceNow itself has found invaluable. Also available is a new profile structure and common risks and controls that you would find within those profiles. Streamline the process for internal stakeholders with a predefined template and consolidate assessments and evidence to facilitate external SOX audit engagements. </p>
