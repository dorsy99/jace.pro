<p>So… you&#39;re looking after ServiceNow and need to keep everything secure? This might seem daunting at first. Whether you’re new to the platform, or an old hand, you’re bound to have lots of questions like:</p>
<ul><li>How secure is my instance?</li><li>What can I do to secure it further?</li><li>Which settings do I need to change?</li><li>How can ServiceNow help with this?</li><li>Where can I find tools and information to help me?</li></ul>
<p>…and probably a few others.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have - of course - built security into the platform from the ground up. And we&#39;ve also included lots of controls, so that you can adjust the security configuration to your needs. These cover things like authentication options, password policy, email and integration security, IP address control, access controls, encryption, and others.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve created tools such as the <em>High Security Plugin</em>, and the <em>Instance Security Dashboard</em> to help you enhance security, monitor activity, and keep on top of the situation.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also provided plenty of information and resources to guide and educate you along the way, such as the <em>HI </em>Support portal and our Compliance portal - <em>CORE</em> - where you can also find the ServiceNow Assurance Pack (SNAP). This will give you valuable contextual information on ServiceNow&#39;s approach to Security.</p>
<p>But we know there is still be a lot to think about – the list of questions above may be just the beginning.</p>
<p>To make things easier, we&#39;ve just released our new <em>Security Best Practice Guide</em> which covers the main points of ServiceNow Security that you&#39;ll need to address - together with recommendations - in one easy-to-follow document. It also contains links to more detailed information on the various topics, so it&#39;s an indispensable resource for a busy Security practitioner. You can think of it as a crib sheet for your ServiceNow security needs.</p>
