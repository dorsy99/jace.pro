<p>The rain didn&#39;t stop our HR customers from attending a great event in Minneapolis!</p>
<p>Yesterday we brought together more than 20 individuals from 7 Minneapolis-area organizations for a morning of networking and best practice sharing at the General Mills campus. Customers head information from our HR BU Product Management team about new functionality in London plus got a sneak peak into what is planned for future releases of HRSD.</p>
<p>Customers shared their best practices and how they are driving efficient HR service delivery in their organizations, using HRSD to consumerize the employee experience and make it easy for employees.</p>
