<p>It almost passed my eyes, but luckily Philip made me aware of it in one of my other posts about not using DOM manipulation in client scripts (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6454108981790072832/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LINK</a>). This is also a very good example of sharing knowledge is great! If I haven&#39;t shared my stuff about client script, I might never have gotten the knowledge about the UI Policies.</p>
<p>Anyway, within London there comes 2 new functionalities that is very nice. Both will be replacing client script code with OOB none scripting which is the way both me and hopefully ServiceNow likes.</p>
<p>First out is &#34;UI Policy Related List Action&#34;. You can use this to hide and show related lists depending on a specific condition(s).</p>
<p>Second one is the &#34;clear the field value&#34;. This is a nice add on functionality to the old UI policy actions. With this you easy with no code clear a value that is within a field when the conditions are right.</p>
<p>To see it all in &#34;RL&#34;, sit back and relax and watch me do all the hard work.</p>
