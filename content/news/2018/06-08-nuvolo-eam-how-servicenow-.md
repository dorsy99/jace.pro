<p><strong>Partnering for Growth &amp; Scale</strong><br />As you might expect, leveraging the Now Platform to solve more of their business problems and deliver an industry-changing employee experience is always top of mind inside ServiceNow. Key to making this a reality are a number of internally-facing &#39;Now On Now&#39; initiatives which, as the name implies, focuses on ServiceNow, the company, using ServiceNow solutions to run their business. In selecting Nuvolo for its Internal Space &amp; Move Management, ServiceNow has, for the first time, expanded its &#39;Now On Now&#39; efforts to include a Now® Certified application from an ISV partner. <br /><br /><strong>The Opportunity<br /></strong>As a fast growth company, ServiceNow&#39;s real estate portfolio and its capacity to house employees—measured by the number of workspaces it has at any given time—is continuously changing and expanding to support a constant stream of talented new employees across the globe.<br /><br />In late 2017, while planning for significant headcount growth over a multi-year planning horizon, ServiceNow&#39;s Real Estate &amp; Workplace team recognized that the time was right to re-think its approach to Space Management by investing in a much more robust technology solution, one that is purpose-built and can easily scale as the company physically scales.<br /><br />After an exhaustive dive into the myriad of space and move management solutions available in the marketplace—most of which fall into the category of an Integrated Workplace Management System or IWMS—Robert Teed, Vice President of Real Estate &amp; Workplace states that &#34;we found Nuvolo&#39;s Facilities EAM application to be the best fit overall in a fairly crowded landscape. High on our team&#39;s list of positives: 1) Nuvolo&#39;s truly cloud-based architecture, unlike a number of legacy IWMS products we reviewed, and 2) Nuvolo&#39;s unique position as the only IWMS solution built entirely on the Now platform, making administration, maintenance and enhancements relatively simple.&#34;<br /><br /><strong>Nuvolo Facilities EAM<br /></strong>As an early partner of ServiceNow and the only Space &amp; Move Management offering built natively on the Now Platform, we were excited to arm ServiceNow&#39;s Real Estate &amp; Workplace team with Nuvolo&#39;s Facilities EAM Now® Certified application to modernize their space and move management.<br /><br />Many of you will have experienced the power of the Now Platform in your IT Service Management and Operations, improving and digitizing workflows and consolidating applications on a single platform.<br /><br />With Nuvolo&#39;s Facilities EAM application, you can track, manage and maintain your facilities assets and perform space management, contract management, lease management and more all on the single Now Platform you know and trust.<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Partnering with IT</strong><br />Nuvolo is built natively on the Now Platform. Because ServiceNow&#39;s Real Estate &amp; Workplace Services team is able to use the application mostly &#39;out of box,&#39; Robert Teed reports that ServiceNow IT was onboard from the start. He says, &#34;Typical IWMS implementations are usually very heavy lifting for both the business user and IT, depending on the level of integration needed, and can take upwards of a year or more to achieve even partial value. In the case of Nuvolo&#39;s Facilities EAM application, we will be at full value in roughly 6 months. This is due in large part to the inherent knowledge our IT team has about ServiceNow by way of ITSM and our other products deployed internally. This is not unique to ServiceNow as a company, however; any ServiceNow customer would have the same rapid deployment experience.&#34;<br /><br /><strong>Investment Future-Proofing</strong><br />As Robert Teed explains, &#34;we are early in our journey with Nuvolo and I feel we have just scratched the surface of what we can do together to unleash the power of their EAM application and our platform. We are looking across all of the work we do that is not already digitized and on-platform as opportunities for Nuvolo to add value to our team.&#34;<br /><br />In partnership with Nuvolo, ServiceNow&#39;s Real Estate &amp; Workplace team now manages ServiceNow&#39;s more than 6,000 global employees and almost 2 million square footage of company space with:</p>
<ul><li>Native AutoCAD integration</li><li>Drag and drop space assignments</li><li>Color-coded space visualizations</li><li>A seamless digital workflow with IT and HR</li><li>A single platform for real time reporting and analytics</li></ul>
<p><iframe id="video_tinymce" style="width: 100%; height: 480px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/31rInr0vJ5Q"></iframe><br /><br />These tactical upgrades have led to significant business improvements, including:</p>
<ul><li>Breaking down longstanding silos between Real Estate &amp; Workplace, Global Talent and IT</li><li>Easier and more flexible scenario planning across remote, serviced and fixed offices</li><li>Deeper and smarter utilization reporting</li><li>Smarter and more strategic employee &#34;neighborhoods&#34;</li><li>Space visualizations for new employees</li></ul>
