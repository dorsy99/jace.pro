<p>Health system breach makes headline news…again. With new vulnerabilities being discovered every day, it’s not a matter of if, but a question of when.</p>
<p>Like in the song made famous by Janis Joplin, a healthcare breach, is a like a “Piece of My Heart”. Personal and costly.</p>
<p>Given this high and potentially growing breach rate, ServiceNow commissioned the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/lpayr/ponemon-vulnerability-survey.html?cid&#61;s:servicematters:12672" rel="nofollow">Ponemon Institute to survey nearly 3,000 cybersecurity professionals</a>. Of those surveyed, 322 were from healthcare organizations.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #013f01; font-size: 18px;">58%</strong> of respondents who reported a breach said that they were breached due to a vulnerability for which a patch was available but not applied.</p>

<p>While all are aware of the importance of cyber-security, with a vigilant focus on securing a health system’s infrastructure, 52% of security team respondents were held back by manual processes and disconnected systems – compromising their ability to respond in a timely manner with 11 days or more lost coordinating patching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="b09e0391db3b9f400be6a345ca96194b.iix" /></p>
<p>The study also uncovered adding security professionals to the problem, does not equal better security. Even if you could, according to ISACA, a global non-profit IT advocacy group, the global shortage of cybersecurity professionals will reach 2 million by 2019.</p>

<p>The cost to do nothing, is not an option. According to a recent <a href="https://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/55/en/55017055usen/2018-global-codb-report_06271811_55017055USEN.pdf" rel="nofollow">2018 Ponemon study</a>, for every record lost is $148 and rises to more than $408 for healthcare organizations. Unless security teams adopt new approaches, these will likely rise.</p>
<p>The good news is that these barriers are not insurmountable. By automating routine processes and taking care of basic hygiene items, security teams can significantly reduce the risk of a breach.</p>
<p>You can protect and keep your organizations heart and health data secure.
