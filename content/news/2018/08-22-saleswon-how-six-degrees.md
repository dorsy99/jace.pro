<p><strong>The Customer</strong></p>
<p>Based in London, United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.6dg.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Six Degrees Group</a> provides integrated managed data services linking people, places, and the cloud. It serves medium-sized enterprises and mid-market corporate customers in various industries ranging from finance and legal, to charity and entertainment. Because Six Degrees has business in a diverse range of industries, it is vital that the team has a sales application that works for an array of current and prospective clients.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Over the recent years, Six Degrees Group has acquired a variety of organizations, each with its own sales process built on separate systems. After having to cope with maintenance of different products and pricing models, Six Degrees knew that in order to move forward as a single, cohesive company, the team needed a single sales process and a single line of support for their customers. Prior to the multitude of acquisitions, Six Degrees was on a locally-hosted instance of Microsoft Dynamics™ and was being asked to move onto Microsoft Dynamics 365. Because of their multiple acquisitions and the over-complication due to disparate systems, Six Degrees knew they needed to consider a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution that could provide a way to simplify their sales processes and bring their company together with one, simple solution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>As Six Degrees already utilizes ServiceNow ITSM to hold core company IT data and assurance functions, it made sense to choose a CRM and Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) solution that allows them to realize the benefits of sales and support on the same platform, including:</p>
<ul><li>A single sales process from lead management to customer support</li><li>The development of complex quotes within ServiceNow</li><li>Immediate access to support data without the need for system integrations</li><li>A single repository for core company IT data with easy maintenance</li><li>ServiceNow supportability of API plugins to integrate with 3rd party systems</li></ul>
<p>By utilizing SalesWon on ServiceNow, Six Degrees can experience the logistical benefits of one platform to support and maintain. In terms of support and developers, there are fewer specialists required and there is only one platform to train users on. When Six Degrees brings in new talent, on-boarding will be expedited because there will only be one system to learn and fewer training materials to be created and maintained. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://saleswon.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SalesWon</a>, all data integrity and validity issues are removed because there is now a single master version of customer data that all employees across all departments can access and modify. Now, Six Degrees has their entire organization working on a single platform to maintain existing client relationships, sell products and services, on-board new customers, manage and deliver orders with easy integration to customer invoicing, along with production support. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The SalesWon quote builder allows a company to deploy quote development functionality to their entire sales force without the need for pre-sales support or drawn out training efforts.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Implementation</strong></p>
<p>After choosing to implement SalesWon, Six Degrees came up with a plan to slowly bring users onto the new system with a soft launch. The Six Degrees team held low and high-level training sessions to familiarize everyone with SalesWon, the new process, and to address any gaps. Adoption within the development team was easier for members that had previously worked on ServiceNow ITSM and departments that were already utilizing ServiceNow had an easy transition. Because the Six Degrees team was already familiar with the platform, implementation time was significantly shortened. This was an important benefit to Six Degrees, as two of the main benefits they were looking for when deciding whether or not to stay with Microsoft Dynamics were the overall cost and time to deliver. With SalesWon, Six Degrees was provided a better CRM solution for their needs, at a better price, and with a quicker time to deliver. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The SalesWon Pipeline Manager provides sales teams with the tools needed to manage their entire sales process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Results (So Far)</strong></p>
<p>After implementing SalesWon, Six Degrees has experienced the benefits of a single repository to maintain their sales pipeline:</p>
<ul><li>Better lead and sales conversion rates</li><li>Faster quote to cash process</li><li>Improved approvals process</li><li>Improved data/integrity/validity</li></ul>
<p>With SalesWon, the product management team can easily roll out products with variant pricing options, team efficiency can be measured and improved through SLA/OLA tracking, and their whole process has been streamlined now that it is all on one platform. Because Six Degrees is now utilizing a CRM solution on the same platform as their ITSM data, they will be able to seamlessly take on new customers and follow them from pre-sales all the way into support with all the data they need and no integrations. In the future, Six Degrees is expecting SalesWon to also improve their customer satisfaction score, customer churn rate, and increase their retention rate. </p>
<p>By utilizing a CRM and CPQ solution on the Now Platform, Six Degrees has transformed from multiple companies with multiple sales processes into one company working together cohesively.</p>
