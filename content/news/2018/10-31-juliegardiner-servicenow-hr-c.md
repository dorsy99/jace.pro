<p> </p>
<p>During this VIP session for customers only, you will learn what is coming in future releases of HRSD as well as hear from others using HRSD to consumerize the employee experience and drive efficient HR service delivery in their organization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You’ll also get the chance to learn how ServiceNow successfully replaced our custom onboarding solution with the out-of-the-box HR Enterprise Onboarding &amp; Transitions solution. Discover how easy it is to orchestrate and automate employee onboarding - a process that typically begins in HR, but spans multiple systems and departments including IT, facilities, security, finance and legal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a result, ServiceNow has seen an improvement in employee satisfaction and increased efficiency in HR and other departments due to the automatic creation of tasks and assignments. Hiring managers now have full visibility and insight into the entire onboarding process, and our new hires have an engaging employee service center where they can complete all their onboarding tasks and interact in real-time with the HR Team.</p>
