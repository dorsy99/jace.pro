<p>When ServiceNow releases a new version there are always functionality that you don&#39;t read about, but suddenly pops up on you screen. And that was exactly what happen to me. I was just playing around with Scripts - Background and suddenly noticed a new line after I ran the code saying &#34;Script execution history and recovery available here&#34;.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>After clicking on the link I ended up in a record showing my code and more option like e.g. doing a rollback on the records I changed with my script.</p>
<p>I could also go and see records that I have deleted manually and rollback those and the related records like this SLA attached to an incident.</p>

<p>So grab a cup of coffee and follow me as I walk through the different functionalities in this video:</p>
