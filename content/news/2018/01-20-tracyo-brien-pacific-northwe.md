<p>We have recently separated the Pacific Northwest SNUG into two separate ones (Seattle and Portland) in order to better map our members geographically. All members of the Pacific Northwest SNUG are now members of the Seattle SNUG. </p><p>You can find the Portland SNUG community site <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=a9291a2ddbd897c068c1fb651f9619ad">here.</a> To join the Portland SNUG simply click on the Join this group button in the upper right-hand corner. If you would prefer not to receive updates regarding the Seattle SNUG, click on Leave this group while on the Seattle SNUG home page- it's at the top of the page next to Join this group. Â  You are welcome to be a member of both SNUGs!</p>
