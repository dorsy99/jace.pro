<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Just a reminder - Your Notification settings will control whether or not you get an email notification when things are posted in this community group. This will include notification settings for Questions from other users and their responses, Articles or Blogs being posted and most importantly Events being posted. (There are discrete settings for each) Please ensure you have these notifications set up correctly in order to stay in touch with the community AND ensure that your contact information is up to date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to set up your preferences:</span></p>
<p>Once you are logged into the community, click on your profile name in the top right corner and you will see a menu. Click the &#39;Notification Settings&#39; link.</p>

<p>This takes you to the main Subscriptions menu where you can subscribe/unsubscribe from any groups you are a member of. Ensure you are Subscribed to the &#39;<strong>ServiceNow User Group - AU - Perth</strong>&#39; group. You will also notice a toggle switch at the top of this page to &#39;Receive Notification&#39; - Ensure this is switched on.</p>

<p>Click on the &#39;Notification Preferences&#39; column header (Next to where &#39;Subscriptions&#39; is underlined in Blue) and you will then be able to view all of your preferences for Notifications. Please ensure you have at least the 3 activities circled in red below switched &#39;on&#39; to ensure you don&#39;t miss out on any updates, but the more the better too.</p>
