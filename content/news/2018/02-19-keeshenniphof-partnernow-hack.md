<h3><strong>Categories</strong></h3>
<p>We created 4 categories for the teams to compete in:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CATEGORY I – PLATFORM FOR A DIVERSITY PROGRAM</strong><br />Many organisations drive internal programs aimed at making employees from all walks of life and gender or cultural backgrounds feel at home in the workplace. In this category, we ask you to create an internal community platform to support such initiatives, bringing people together and allowing them to exchange ideas, share information, start new projects and have an even greater impact on the people they work with!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CATEGORY II – HAVE SOME SERIOUS FUN IN KINGSTON</strong><br />With our Kingston release, ServiceNow introduces some phenomenal new technology. This is your chance to go all out and show us what GREAT looks like. Intelligent Automation, Major Incident Management, Flow Designer, IntegrationHub – create an app to showcase our new capabilities, have fun and wow the crowd!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CATEGORY III – CAN WE HAVE SOME MARKETING BUDGET, PLEASE?</strong><br />ServiceNow loves to support partners in their marketing efforts. Can you build a ServiceNow app to structure and automate the process of allocating ServiceNow funds to co-marketing activities requested and driven by our Channel Partners? So that we support the activities that move the needle in market and together, we grow even faster? Thank you!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CATEGORY IV – OPEN CATEGORY</strong><br />We don’t tell you what to do. Just get your instance, get in there, and knock our socks off!</p>
<p>We look forward to another great session, with excellent apps and lots of laughs. You bring your ideas and good spirit, we’ll throw in some good food and drinks.</p>
<p>See you on March 5th in Barcelona!</p>
<p>Team ServiceNow,</p>
