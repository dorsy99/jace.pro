<p>Ubiquitous and always on, voice is becoming the new user interface of choice in our homes, cars and work. Driving billions of additional mobile phone calls to businesses, it’s only natural for enterprises to focus on voice interface technology as a customer engagement channel.</p>
<p>A wealth of information between the customer and service rep lies within every voice conversation.</p>
<p>The <strong>3CLogic ServiceNow</strong> solution integrates contact-center telephony, traditionally used for external customer conversations, with ServiceNow’s service management platform, providing previously untapped visibility into those engagements.<br /><br /> <strong>3CLogic’s consolidated reports and dashboards in ServiceNow deliver deep analytic capabilities</strong> that make it possible for organizations to explore new ways to analyze and derive insights to resolve incidents faster, improve customer experience and boost customer loyalty.</p>
