<p>Attention Technology Partners,</p><p></p><p>If you are new to the program or have a new application in the pipe for certification, make sure you get that submitted as soon as possible. <a title="nowledge.servicenow.com/" href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/">Knowledge18</a> is only 3 months away, it's currently taking new application submissions approximately 6 weeks (on average) to complete the certification process, working backwards from May 7th, that gives you roughly 3-4 weeks to wrap up your development and get that application into our queue. We typically see a massive spike in the number of submissions for certification in the months before the event, not all submissions will make it through the process, the longer you wait to get it into our queue, the lower your chances of having a certified application ready to demo on the floor of K18.</p><p></p><p>Curious about that process?
