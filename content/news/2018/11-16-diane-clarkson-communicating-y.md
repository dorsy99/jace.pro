<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">A transformation vision should be the “North Star” that guides strategy, road map planning, budget allocation, and priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Defining the value is the best first step. Where are the goal posts? How do you answer the question: “What’s the ideal future state for our customers and our organization?” A good vision answers how you will get there and how will you measure your progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Digital transformation can last for months or years. It is important that there is broad understanding of the effort and the incremental progress it is making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">I recently spoke with a global retail executive and asked how his company keeps its digital transformation vision meaningful. He offered three pieces of advice that I thought were very helpful</span></p>
<ol><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Brand your transformation effort. (As an example, ING branded its transformation “Fast Forward”)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Remember people understand complex ideas better as stories than as buzzwords. Highlight your vision and progress towards it consistently from All-Hands to department meetings.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Embed “How does this help us achieve our vision” as the key decision-making question across the organization.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">ServiceNow points to the best practice of prioritizing initiatives that are strategically important. This will offer a quick return and will reduce complexity.  It is important to remember that these wins should be embedded into your ongoing transformation story.</span></p>
