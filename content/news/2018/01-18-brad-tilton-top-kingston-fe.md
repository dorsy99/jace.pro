<p>Kingston became generally available last week, so it's about that time for me to read through all of the platform and appdev release notes so you don't have to! Every release brings new applications, features, enhancements, and APIs that may be applicable to someone developing an application to list on the store or OEM, and I try to surface those here. Kingston is full of new enhancements and features, so without further adieu, here is a list of things that store developers should know about and consider taking advantage of in Kingston.</p><p></p><p><strong>Features and Enhancements</strong></p><ul><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/restricted-caller-access.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/restricted-caller-access.html">Application restricted caller access settings</a> - Restricted caller access settings enable an admin user to define cross-scope access to an application or application resource and allow or deny requests for access.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/administer/exporting-data/concept/export-controls.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/administer/exporting-data/concept/export-controls.html">Export Enhancements</a> - Control the column value and header value in export files using query parameters, export set properties, and system properties.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/administer/notification/concept/email-digests.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/administer/notification/concept/email-digests.html">Email Digests</a> - Enable an email digest, a single email that summarizes the activity for a notification during a digest (time) interval that you specify. By enabling an email digest for a selected notification, you can reduce the number of emails received when associated records are frequently updated during a short time period.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/build/platform-functions/concept/platform-support-functions.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/build/platform-functions/concept/platform-support-functions.html">Function Fields</a> - Create function fields and scripts in the platform to perform common database transformations and calculations. Function fields and function scripts let application developers and administrators use those functions in the platform in an integrated and familiar way without requiring any knowledge of SQL or RDBMS specifics. This is one of my favorite Kingston features.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/service-portal-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/service-portal-rn.html">Service Portal Enhancements</a> - Too many to name them all, but announcements, SEO, page redirects, and font awesome updates are a few of the enhancements.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/application-development/embedded-help-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/application-development/embedded-help-rn.html">Embedded Help Enhancements</a> - Use embedded help qualifiers, have the ability to embed video, and enable in a domain separated environment.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>APIs</strong></p><ul><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/api-changes-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/api-changes-rn.html">General Platform APIs and Methods</a> - New classes and methods have been added such as CartJS.setRequestedFor() and a HistoryWalker class.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_IdentifyReconcileAPI.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_IdentifyReconcileAPI.html">CMDB SDK</a> - REST API to enable third-party applications to use the identification and reconciliation engine to create, read, and update configuration item (CI) records.</li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_RESTAPISecurity.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_RESTAPISecurity.html">REST API Security</a> - Each platform REST API has an associated REST_Endpoint access control list (ACL) that is deactivated by default, but can be activated on a per API basis.</li><li>New <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-operations-management/credentials-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-operations-management/credentials-rn.html">Credentials APIs</a> - All application integrations in the Now Platform require connection information, credentials, and connection and credential aliases to their respective applications to access resources. Learn about the new ways to manage these artifacts on the platform.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Reporting and Dashboards</strong></p><p>There were too many of these to call out individually, but I would read through these release notes if you provide any dashboards or reports through your application.</p><ul><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/reporting-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/reporting-rn.html">Reporting Release Notes</a></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/dashboards-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/performance-analytics-reporting/dashboards-rn.html">Dashboards Release Notes</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Platform Enhancements to Note</strong></p><p>These aren't necessarily enhancements that you need to use as a developer, but it may be helpful to know they exist.</p><ul><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/accessibility-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/accessibility-rn.html">Accessibility Improvements</a> - Accessibility has been improved throughout the platform in congruence with WCAG 2.0 level A and AA standards to make the system more perceivable, operable, and understandable to all users.

Configure an audit trail to track the number of views and downloads for a particular document.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Release Notes by Product</strong></p><p>I've covered Platform and Application Development release notes in this article, but if your app has a dependency or adjacency to a ServiceNow product, you should read through that product's Kingston release notes.
