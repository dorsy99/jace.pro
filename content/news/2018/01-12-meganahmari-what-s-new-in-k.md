<p>In the Kingston release, Now Platform<sup>TM</sup> introduces three innovative applications and a number of performance enhancements to improve user experience and drive digital transformation with intelligent apps.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Agent Intelligence</h2>
<p><em>Supervised Machine Learning Tailored to Each Customer and Their Own Data</em></p>
<p><img class="image-3 jive-image" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 575px; height: 323.438px;" src="3355408edb1c5fc068c1fb651f961942.iix" width="575" height="323" /></p>
<p>ServiceNow is introducing a breakthrough approach to make machine learning more accessible to organizations — one that does not rely on an army of data scientists. Machine learning capabilities have been infused directly into the Now Platform, making it available to all of our cloud services and other applications built on ServiceNow. Agent Intelligence helps automate business processes and places the focus further on service ownership, innovation, and strategy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Known as Agent Intelligence, the patented supervised machine learning engine categorizes, routes, and assigns work to automate processes based on the unique characteristics of each customer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part of the Intelligent Automation Engine, Agent Intelligence will initially be applied to improving the speed and quality of IT and customer-service processes. Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer-support center.   These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner — whether it is a request for a new computer, a password reset or the status of a repair. Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases, categorizing tasks, and routing work can consume people resources, introduce human error and slow resolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In fact, a new <a title="ww.servicenow.com/lpayr/agent-intelligence.html" href="https://www.servicenow.com/lpayr/agent-intelligence.html" rel="nofollow">report from Accenture</a> found that front-line customer support functions spend up to 12% of their time categorizing, prioritizing, and assigning tickets. 43% of IT service desk respondents are weighed down by having to choose from 100&#43; assignment groups — with nearly a quarter needing to choose from 300&#43; assignment groups. After training on tens of thousands of historical incidents, requests, or cases, Agent Intelligence automatically applied the right categorization, severity, and routing information to speed resolution of the task or case with accuracy of up to 82%<a title="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[i]</span></a>.The deployment of Agent Intelligence means intelligent custom apps can allow customers to experience faster time to resolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agent Intelligence is a great example of the practical application of machine learning to getting everyday work done faster and smarter, without having to depend on scarcely available, highly skilled data scientists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A separate SKU for Agent Intelligence will be available for Now Platform for an additional cost. Please contact your account team for more information.</p>

<h2>ServiceNow Flow Designer</h2>
<p><em>Create and Manage Codeless Flows on the Now Platform<sup>TM</sup></em></p>
<p><img class="image-4 jive-image" style="width: 580px; height: 337.855px;" src="51102ffddb1093041dcaf3231f961930.iix" alt="CommunityBlog.png" width="580" height="338" /></p>
<p>Defining and managing process flows that require coding not only slows delivery timelines, but also creates costly dependencies on more experienced developers — the very thing no and low code approaches were designed to remedy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With ServiceNow Flow Designer, anyone can build their own flows and automate business processes on ServiceNow instances without using code in a natural language environment. Flow Designer is the next generation of workflow, allowing process analysts and IT generalists to author codeless flows using natural language to automate task management and auto-remediate tasks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Flow designers define trigger conditions to start a flow and use variables to pass information between actions. Such actions include the ability to manage records, ask for approvals, create tasks, and send notifications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ServiceNow Flow Designer will be included with any Now Platform license.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>IntregrationHub</h2>
<p><em>Extend ServiceNow Flow Designer to Automate Third Party Services</em></p>
<p><img class="image-5 jive-image" style="width: 589px; height: 330.6px;" src="91632c4edb5c5344e9737a9e0f96192c.iix" alt="CommunityBlogIntegrationHub.png" width="589" height="331" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With productivity and efficiency in mind, ServiceNow is releasing IntegrationHub, our next generation Orchestration solution for integrating third party services codelessly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The application extends the functionality of ServiceNow Flow Designer to automate third party services. IntegrationHub provides out of the box integrations for third party systems, including collaboration services such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Hipchat. IntegrationHub also allows for eBonding with other ServiceNow instances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Users with limited coding skills and experience can now be more effective contributors to the delivery of solutions that drive innovation for the business by simplifying how they develop process flows that leverage integrations. Over time, ServiceNow IntegrationHub will become the main way developers and administrators, regardless of coding experience, will build process flows and integrations on the Now Platform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IntegrationHub is a for-charge offering. Contact your account rep for more information.</p>
