<h4>Attention Technology Partners,</h4>

<p>With Knowledge18 quickly approaching, the deadline for submitting your store apps for certification and having them certified by Knowledge18 is <strong>Monday, April 9th</strong>. Practically, you should be finished or near completed in the app build and getting into testing next week. The more testing you do, the faster certification will go, so here are some links around testing your app:</p>
