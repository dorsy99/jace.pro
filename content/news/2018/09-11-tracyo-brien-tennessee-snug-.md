<p>We have recently separated the Tennessee SNUG into three separate ones (Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville) in order to better map our members geographically. All members of the Tennessee SNUG are now members of the Nashville SNUG by default as it had the largest number of members.</p>
<p>You can find the Memphis SNUG Community <a href="community?id&#61;community_forum&amp;sys_id&#61;3efca872db9ca3885ed4a851ca96192b" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the Knoxville SNUG community site <a href="community?id&#61;community_forum&amp;sys_id&#61;4ca9a872db1ca3885ed4a851ca9619b0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. To join either SNUG, simply click on the Subscribe or Join button in the upper right-hand corner. If you would prefer not to receive updates regarding the Nashville SNUG, click on the Subscribed button and it will turn to Unsubscribed while on the Nashville SNUG home page. You are welcome to be a member of one, two, or all three SNUG groups in Tennessee!</p>

<p>I hope to see you at the next SNUG event on October 10th!</p>
