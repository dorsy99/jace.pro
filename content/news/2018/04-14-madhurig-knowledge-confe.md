<p>With <strong>Knowledge18</strong> less than a month away, we&#39;ve got some updates on the <a href="community?id&#61;community_odl" rel="nofollow">On Demand Library</a> to help maximize your experience. This library is a dedicated place on the Community featuring session materials from Knowledge Conference and other ServiceNow events making it easier for you to search, browse and filter by type of event, content and more.</p>
<p>Hundreds of exclusive presentations including breakout sessions, labs, workshops and videos will be available during and after the conference anytime, anywhere on-demand at your convenience. The new interface is slightly different from the previous one. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please login using Knowledge18 registration credentials. Attendees with a Full Conference pass will have access to all presentations. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If this is the first time you are logging in, you will be presented with a community registration form. </p>
<p>Keynotes and videos are available for all.<strong> </strong>Access the library by clicking <strong>Events</strong> in the main navigation and then clicking <strong>On Demand Library</strong> or <strong>Knowledge18</strong> and then <strong>Session Content.</strong> </p>

<p>To download a presentation, simply go to the <a href="community?id&#61;community_odl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">On Demand Library</a> and <strong>Search</strong> by entering a keyword/phrase in the search bar and clicking the search button (pressing enter also works).  Use the <strong>Refine library</strong> <strong>filters</strong> on the left to narrow your results. If you are unsure of the name of the session, use these filters to find the relevant content. Select an <strong>Event</strong> and <strong>Type</strong> to begin with. </p>
<p>Tips on fine-tuning your search.</p>
<ul><li>Use fewer search terms. For example, enter the full Session Code CSS4024.</li><li>Use more general search terms.</li><li>Use the <strong>* character as a wildcard</strong> at the end of any word in your query.</li></ul>
<p>Please note, if you have entered a search term, selecting more than 6 filters may not yield any results. </p>
<p>Similarly if no search term is provided, adding more than 4 filters also may not display any results. </p>
