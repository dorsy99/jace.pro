<p>For the London release our IT Business Management product teams have focused on three themes:</p>
<ul><li>Usability</li><li>Advancing PPM functionality</li><li>Scaling agile development capabilities</li></ul>
<p>These themes represent another innovative leap forward for IT Business Management, in many cases building on the advances and new features already delivered in the Kingston release.</p>
<p>Improvements to PPM functionality help you to focus work where it matters the most. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>The <strong>Investment Portal</strong> simplifies access to portfolio performance for all stakeholders. It allows you to create your own view of investments and share them with other stakeholders. You get to configure metrics to summarize performance across investments and easy grouping of investments in a new grid format means you can get more done.</p>

<p><strong>Resource Management</strong> is improved both for project managers defining project resources and for resource managers that allocate them. The Resource Allocation Workbench allows you to create resource e allocation views based on groups, projects, or roles and then easily manage assignment using the new grid view.</p>

<p>The <strong>Project Workspace</strong> was introduced in Kingston and in London we’ve taken it to the next level, so you can plan and execute even more efficiently. The improved console hides unused options to reduce clutter and can automatically configure records based on selected actions. A full RIDAC model supports tracking of Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions and Changes.</p>

<p>The adoption of Agile best practices is exploding but doing agile development at scale introduces governance problems. The London release has numerous enhancements to our agile development support but also introduces an implementation of the <strong>Essential Scaled Agile Framework</strong> standard from Scaled Agile Inc.</p>
<p>Get teams to the finish line faster than ever by planning program increments with a <strong>drag-and-drop big room planning board</strong> and prioritize features from a single backlog using <strong>Weighted Shortest Job First</strong> (WSJF) scoring.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>There’s more in the release in other areas such as in Application Portfolio Management where we’ve enhanced the business capability-based planning. Now there is a more intuitive hierarchy thanks to APQC-compliant IDs.</p>
