<p><em>This is the second in a series of suggested practices in creating Knowledge Base content.</em></p>
<p>You’ve created your Knowledge Base content, and you think it looks okay. But then again, it is missing something. What is it? Take a look at what you’ve written to see if it could benefit from adding attachments or screenshots. Images are a useful way to add more info to your KB articles. You like information, right? </p>

<h1>Attach or not to attach?</h1>
<p>Attachments can add value to an article if they are properly used. However, make sure that any information you want to be sure users see is in the body of the article. Also, attachments should not just repeat the information in the article.<br /><br />The following guidelines will help you make the most of your KB article attachments.</p>
<h3>Attachment visibility</h3>
<p>Once you’ve added your attachments, make sure to check the Display Attachments option on the article form. Otherwise, you may have a great context-adding attachment, but if customers/users are unable to see it, it’s not very helpful. Checking this box allows the attachment to be visible to your customers/users.</p>

<h3>Remember that they&#39;re searchable</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that attachments are searchable so make sure:</p>
<ul><li>they are relevant</li><li>they contain only appropriate information for the audience</li><li>they are not overly broad</li></ul>
<h3>Edit your attachments like you would your article</h3>
<p>With attachments, review what’s in them to make sure that items attached to Public articles contain only information suitable for an external audience. Also, review the attachments to verify there is no customer information or internal information such as internal server names, URLs, or employee logins, and so on.</p>
<h3>Utilizing Script or XML files</h3>
<p>If your attachment is a script or XML file, make sure for Public articles that it is runnable externally. Also, double-check that it does not contain any internal references such as internal server or employee names.</p>
<h3>Attachment file names</h3>
<p>Just like you wouldn’t title your article with “Article title,” use meaningful names for attachment files rather than generic descriptions.</p>
<p>How not to name your files:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>&#34;pastedimage1.png&#34;</li><li>&#34;Screen Shot 2017-12-18 at 3.05.35 PM.png&#34;</li><li>&#34;NewScript.xml.&#34;</li></ul>
<p>This enables your users/customers to clearly identify the attachments they would like to view. A better example might be &#34;TransitionScript_063018.&#34;</p>

<h2>Screenshots or not?</h2>
<p>Screenshots can help readers more quickly understand a location in the interface or an illustration of the issue, by pointing it out instead of them having to search for it. Here are some things to keep in mind when considering screenshots.</p>
<h3>Screenshot non-searchability</h3>
<p>While attachments are searchable, screenshots are not. Make sure that you are not using them to substitute for text explanations. For this reason, they should be context-adding and not context-replacing.</p>
<h3>Duplications</h3>
<p>Do not include numerous callouts that repeat or are substitutes for sequential actions.</p>
<h3>Make it legible</h3>
<p>Sizing your image so that it does not require too much horizontal scrolling limits your customer or user frustration.</p>
<ul><li>Try making the image as small as possible while still illustrating the necessary area in order to maximize impact.</li><li>Consider cropping images to be able to enlarge and emphasize the specific area relevant to the issue.</li></ul>
<h3>Include buttons and icons</h3>
<p>Insert graphic attachments in the text and do not reference them via URL. This might be helpful when trying to direct a customer/user to a specific button or icon to click, showing them the image in the text.</p>

<h3>Keep certain information out</h3>
<p>Although screenshots should be context-adding, make sure they do do not contain any customer information or internal information such as employee login names, URLs, and so on. <a title=" 8 Tips to Help Improve Content in your Knowledge Base" href="http://bit.ly/ImproveKBcontent1" rel="nofollow"> 8 Tips to Help Improve Content in your Knowledge Base</a> will help you keep your content audience-friendly. </p>
