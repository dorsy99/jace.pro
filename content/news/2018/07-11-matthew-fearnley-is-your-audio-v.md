<p>As Audio Visual (AV) equipment gravitates towards a networked services model is it time for AV to be formally placed in IT? I would argue that it is long past due. This is based on the answers two quick questions:</p>
<ul><li>Do you have networked equipment?</li><li>When AV issues arrive do the calls go to the service desk? </li></ul>
<p>If the answer to one of these questions is yes....... then we should talk. As AV is plugged into a PC (which is the engine that drives everything) access, permissions, clients, version control and ultimately usability becomes an &#34;AV&#34; issue. Yet AV still lives outside of IT (or it lives in the basement, guest house or crashed on the couch) AV still isn&#39;t a fully baked IT service.</p>
<p>Whatever you call it, &#34;Classroom Support&#34;,&#34; Academic Technology&#34; or something else ultimately it comes down to an AV/IT hybrid model. So how do we pivot AV into an IT (read: ServiceNow) environment?</p>
<ul><li>First decide what is that your AV team supports, classrooms? conference rooms? digital signage? specialty spaces like amphitheaters and performance spaces?</li><li>Are operational requests and technical requests going to the same team?</li><li>Assign the proper tickets from these rooms to your AV support team</li></ul>
<p>Once you have established &#34;ownership&#34; then the CMDB, ITFM process and workflows will align.</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots to consider but if you are interested in learning more......hop on the thread. We are putting together a Higher Ed AV working group and would love to hear your concerns, comments and hopes for the future.</p>
<p>In my travels I have found that we all experience many of the same issues so our goal is to make all of our lives a little bit easier</p>
<p><strong>Next week&#39;s post:</strong> Crestron, Polycom, Bluejeans, Aerva, Solstice......how to structure an AV CMDB.</p>
