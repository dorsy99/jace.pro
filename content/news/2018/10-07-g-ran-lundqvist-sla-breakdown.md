<p>There are so much new things in London, both big and small stuff. It seems like there just isn&#39;t enough time to show it all. But here is another functionality that comes with London that has at least been mention a few times in different places. It&#39;s the SLA Breakdown I&#39;m talking about. This gives the managers an easy overview to see e.g. how long a task has been on a specific group or assignee and with reporting you can get a good overview to understand how people are working in the different processes and hopefully also finding the bottlenecks and eliminate them to have an even better flow through the processes and hopefully reaching a higher amount of tasks that doesn&#39;t break their SLA.</p>
<p>Earlier, you might have been trying to get the same data out from metrics, but this is a more easier and user friendly way of doing it.</p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t have time for a video, this is an example of how it can look like (hard to get good demodata)</p>

<p>Now, if this has gotten your apatite up, here is the video as well :)</p>
