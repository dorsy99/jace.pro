<p>So now you know a little about us, here is the skinny on the PPM.    </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>We have been up on ServiceNow for two years on ITSM, and we have an SN Administrator and two SN developers.  Our administrator has his hands full with our ITSM module, and our developers are heads down migrating many or our legacy workgroup applications to SN.  So, while we have very competent SN resources, our preferred method for our PPM implementation will be OOTB functionality and then an optimization phase 6-12 months after our initial implementation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are pursuing a phased implementation with PPM OOTB  </p>
<p>Phase 1   Project Portfolio, Demand Management, Project Management, Program Management, Agile Development  </p>
<p>Phase 2  Leverage PPM Workshop, Optimization of OOTB  </p>
<p>Phase 3  Resources, Timesheets  </p>
<p>Phase 4  Financial Management, Project Budgeting, Project Forecasting, Project Cost Planning, and Tracking  </p>
<p>As we started our analysis of PPM my first two actions were:  </p>
<p>I also took the PPM remote training class.  This class was very informative and gave a great review of the full system.  It was a two full-day class, and while the class was outstanding, there was a ton of content to absorb.  I highly recommend this class.  </p>
<p> Kelly, Kelly, Kelly - I first used Kelly Kaufmann&#39;s requirement gathering document.  Kelly&#39;s blog, even four years old has stood the test of time and is extremely helpful, and I read every one of Kelly&#39;s #1-#15 blogs with particular attention to the PPM implementation sections.  </p>
<p>We just signed a services work order with Rego consulting company to help us with our PPM OOTB implementation.  Rego was very helpful as we worked through our services agreement.  As we already have a solid idea, demand, and project process as well as a methodology for collecting RAAID data, we hope that we have a straightforward transition into OOTB PPM.  </p>
<p>Phase one and two have the following objectives:</p>
<p>Phase One:  </p>
<ol><li>Implementation of ServiceNow PPM out of the box (OOTB) functionality.  </li><li>Migrate all existing projects into the PPM tool.  </li><li>Follow the same process for ideation and demand that Shepherd Center Information System currently uses.   </li><li>Migrate milestone development, issue – risk management, and project progress reporting from homegrown tools to ServiceNow PPM.  Our project leads training would be focused on the project execution tools within PPM. </li></ol>
<p>  </p>
<p>Phase Two – Summer 2019  </p>
<ol><li>PPM Tool optimizations for ideation and demand processes.  </li><li>Full demand assessment to include financial information.  </li><li>Impact of resource and timecard implementation.  </li><li>PPM optimization for workflows  </li><li>Discussing of use of PPM outside of Information Services team.  </li></ol>
<p>  </p>
<p>Based on this information, we have put together a timeline that looks like this:  </p>

<p>We plan to migrate from our homegrown SharePoint project site to our a new SN PPM environment after we complete a sizeable enterprise-wide program in June.  </p>
<p> Very excited to engage with Rego as we move forward.  </p>
