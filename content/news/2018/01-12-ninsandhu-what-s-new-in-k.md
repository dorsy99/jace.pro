We have introduced new</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> features like <strong>Message Templates</strong>, <strong>Mass Email Communication</strong>, and <strong>Embedded Connect </strong>which are specifically designed to help streamline the HR service experience for both the employee and HR.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="; color: #7030a0; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Message Templates</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">HR now has the ability to create email message templates in order to respond to similar employee questions or inquiries faster and more accurately. This allows HR to greatly improve efficiency by eliminating the need to manually create the same type of response over and over. The new feature allows HR to select an appropriate template, easily personalize it to the employee, and provide employees with a fast and consistent response.   </span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="Message Templates.jpg" class="image-11 jive-image" src="65726bb9db5093049c9ffb651f961969.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 476px;"/></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #7030a0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Mass Email Communication</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When it comes to improving the overall employee experience it starts by not inundating employees with information that doesn't apply to them. We recognize that HR typically needs to communicate all types of important information to their employees ranging from benefits, perks, upcoming events and other important announcements. But, how do you ensure the right employees are getting the right information? Our new Mass Email Communication feature now allows HR to build rich text emails that can be targeted to relevant employee populations, all from one place! For example, HR can easily send targeted information to employees in certain country or even just a simple email to all new hires. This ensures the right employees get the right information and other employees are not spammed with information that isn't applicable to them. </span></p><p></p><p><img   alt="Mass Email Communication.jpg" class="image-13 jive-image" src="37dcc9c2db9413043eb27a9e0f9619f2.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 478px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"><br/><span style="color: #7030a0;"><strong>Embedded Connect</strong></span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When it comes to responding to employee questions or inquiries regarding a task this can be a time consuming back and forth game of email tag between the employee and HR. This is why we have introduced the Embedded Connect real-time chat functionality to help streamline the employee service experience and provide faster time to resolution to employee questions. The real-time chat capability allows employees to ask in-task questions during set interaction hours and have the right people respond instantly. This eliminates any lengthy communication delays between HR and the employee. HR also has the ability to configure which users are responsible for answering employee questions regarding that task, so everything is automatically routed to the right individuals seamlessly. </span></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><img   alt="Embedded Connect.jpg" class="image-14 jive-image" src="ff2da48adb58d704ed6af3231f9619c8.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 477px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #7030a0; font-size: 14.0pt;"><strong>Learn More</strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">These are just a few of the major feature enhancements and highlights of the Kingston release for our HR Service Delivery product. </span>If you're interested in learning more about this release, please contact your account team and they can schedule a demo to show you all the latest and greatest features of the Kingston release for HR Service Delivery.
