<p>Knowledge18 has come and gone.</p>
<p>What an incredible week of announcements, enhancements, and collaboration - all focused on how ServiceNow can make <em>the world of work, work better for people.</em></p>
<p>In addition to all of the in-person activity that was taking place in Keynotes, Labs, Partner Booths and Breakout Sessions, there was a lot of collaboration taking place online on social sites like Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;bd88b1fedbb9d7005322f4621f961983" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">As we mentioned prior to the conference</a>, we thought it would be fun to use some of the Now Platform capabilities to monitor and analyze some of the social data from those conversations using the #Know18 hashtag.</p>

<p>Here are some of the results:</p>
<ul><li>There were 10,550 tweets that contained the hashtag #Know18 between May 6th and May 11th.</li><li>1,808 unique Twitter handles contributed to the conversation.</li><li>If we look at the word frequency analysis it&#39;s probably not surprising that we see the word &#34;work&#34; emphasized on May 8th with John Donahoe revealing ServiceNow&#39;s purpose  - &#34;We make the world of work, work better for people&#34;.  Besides it being the center piece of the keynote the word &#34;work&#34; appears twice in the text which gives it a competitive advantage.</li></ul>

<ul><li>On May 10th theCube release a lot of their content, which contributed to their prominent position.  You can find that coverage here <a href="https://www.thecube.net/search?q&#61;Knowledge18" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.thecube.net/search?q&#61;Knowledge18</a></li></ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I also went back and dug up the data I collected for K17 and it followed a similar pattern.  The Keynote was on May 9th in 2017.</p>

<ul><li>The last piece of analysis is the leaderboard, which not only contributes most to the fun factor but is also the most relevant to how we can use analytics in real life.</li></ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#64;Chris_Pope_NOW led the way this year with 208 tweets during the week of #Know18.  Anecdotally, I believe many of them were pics of people who wanted to get selfies with ServiceNow&#39;s rockstar VP of Innovation.  Chris was followed closely by &#64;nin_sandhu and then &#64;IT_Chronicles.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#64;nin_sandhu has admitted that he actively increased his engagement level to try an catch &#64;chris_pope_NOW.  How&#39;s that for impact?  I bring this up to illustrate the influence that data can have on people&#39;s behaviors and actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This exercise of capturing and analyzing the social data around the conference was designed to be fun and drive some collaboration at the conference but we can use peer to peer analysis with more relevant data in the workplace to influence and reinforce the behaviors and actions required to reach the business outcomes our organizations have prioritized.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You can read more about using data to align stakeholders to business outcomes in either of these posts: <a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;9b2e6a6ddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961954" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Go Beyond the Executive Dashboard with In-Platform Analytics</a> or <a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;b7bcae25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619ad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The ABC&#39;s of Performance Analytics</a>.</p>
