<p>With security threats making headlines on a regular basis, it’s a matter of when, not if, your organization will be affected. But how?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Will your organization become the subject of another security breach headline? </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Or…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">…will your Information Security team catch that phishing attack or malware before you suffer a security breach?</p>
<p>If you’re employing the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-security-management/page/product/security-incident-response/reference/sir-landing-page.html" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Security Incident Response application</a>, you can leverage intelligent workflows and automation, along with a deep connection to IT, to prioritize and resolve threats. We designed the new security operations features in our London release to keep your team at the forefront in countering the ever-present and evolving threats in the security realm.</p>
<p>In this installment of our <a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;6e7d6269dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619c0" rel="nofollow">NOWsupport best practices series</a>, we provide an overview of these new features. And don’t miss our video at the end of this article to see them in action!</p>
<h2><strong>New security analyst user interface (UI)</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-security-management/page/product/security-incident-response/concept/sir-new-ui.html" rel="nofollow">Security Analyst Workspace</a> is a new user interface (UI), purpose-built to provide security professionals with the tools they need to handle security incidents.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="2fca0c91db63d3049d612926ca961982.iix" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Activating the new security analyst UI</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">To activate this feature, request the <strong>Security Incident Response UI</strong> plugin (<strong>com.app_secops_ui</strong>) through the HI Customer Service system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To access this new workspace after the plugin is installed, navigate to <strong>Security Incident &gt; Incidents (New UI)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="a99bc05ddb63d3049d612926ca9619c2.iix" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not sure if you or your team are ready to plunge into using this new UI? No problem—the new UI and the existing UI will co-exist, so that you can transition to the new UI at your own pace.</p>
<p> <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="b0fc04d5dba3d3049d612926ca961961.iix" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<h2><strong>New tools for analyzing data</strong></h2>
<p>Within this new UI are new tools for analyzing data. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<h3><strong>Playbooks </strong></h3>
<p>If you’re a seasoned pro at handling security incidents, you can probably rattle off the steps you need to follow to resolve any type of security incident. But less experienced analysts may need some guidance, especially given that the stakes are so high. The new <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-security-management/page/product/security-incident-response/task/use-the-playbook.html" rel="nofollow">playbook</a> feature allows less experienced analysts to handle incidents using your organization’s best practices, without someone having to look over their shoulder.</p>
<p>Playbooks provide a standard operating procedure, or SOP, with steps to follow when responding to an incident of a particular type.  And they’re right in the workspace, so they’re easy to access as you’re working a security incident.</p>
<p> <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="bd8e445ddba3d3049d612926ca9619f0.iix" /></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Peek view</strong></h3>
<p>Peek view allows you to review an incident from the incident list without reloading the entire page. So you can review multiple incidents quickly for:</p>
<ul><li>Assignment group</li><li>Business impact</li><li>Priority</li><li>Submitted by</li><li>Last Updated by</li><li>Threat Indicator</li><li>Playbook available?</li></ul>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="543fc015dbe3d3049d612926ca9619d1.iix" /></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Tabbed interface </strong></h3>
<p>In the dashboard, you can open and work multiple incidents simultaneously, accessible from tabs at the top of the page. </p>
<p><br /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="d5cf8819dbe3d3049d612926ca961955.iix" /></p>
<p>Tabs within each incident include <strong>Overview</strong>, <strong>Explore</strong>, and <strong>Activity Stream.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Overview</strong> tab provides all of the data you need in one place. You don’t have to access another application or console. The tiles are populated via automated actions. The workspace is customizable—you can move or collapse tiles as needed.</p>
<p>The <strong>Explore</strong> tab is where you work details of the incident, add details to help with the investigation, and run automation to enrich artifacts and eradicate the threat. You can pin widgets from this page to display in the <strong>Overview</strong> tab as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Email search and delete capability</strong></h2>
<p>With the email search and delete capability, you can search for and delete emails throughout your organization to stop a phishing attack in its tracks.</p>
<p>For example, a user reports receiving a suspicious email with the subject “Weekly Audit.” After identifying the email as a phishing attack, you can search for and delete all emails with that subject line, even before users open it!</p>
<p>We provide a demo of this capability in the video below.</p>
