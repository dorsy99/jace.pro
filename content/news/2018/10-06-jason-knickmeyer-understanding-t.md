<p>Just having a <a href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article&#61;KB0553714" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Platform Support Team</a> isn’t enough, if you want to extend ServiceNow as a strategic platform for digital transformation. Why?</p>
<p><strong>An engaged Executive Sponsor can help champion your vision for ServiceNow and remove obstacles that could prevent you from delivering business value using the Platform</strong>. But it can be difficult to find the right leader to be your Executive Sponsor, and to define how that leader can best help you achieve your goals.</p>
<p>To help with this, <strong>we’ve highlighted four questions to consider when defining the Executive Sponsor role</strong>:</p>
<h4><br />1. “Whom should we consider approaching to be our Executive Sponsor?”</h4>
<p><strong>The Executive Sponsor should be a senior leader who can play an active role in supporting the ServiceNow Platform Support Team</strong>. The best Executive Sponsors tend to be c-level leaders because they typically have authority and influence needed to support your vision for ServiceNow. However, it’s also important to <strong>make sure that your Executive Sponsor has the time and interest to be actively engaged</strong> in what you need from them. An Executive Sponsor who just approves budgets, or “checks in” once a month, might not be engaged enough to support your team.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2. “What would our Executive Sponsor’s role and responsibilities be?”</h4>
<p>An Executive Sponsor’s key role is to <strong>work with the Platform Support Team to set the ServiceNow strategic roadmap and ensure it aligns to measurable business outcomes</strong>. They also communicate the value of ServiceNow to executive peers and clear organizational roadblocks to empower the ServiceNow Platform Owner and Support Team to execute the roadmap.</p>

<p><br />A job description for the ideal Executive Sponsor should include:</p>
<ul><li>Creates and enforces the vision and strategy for the program managing the platform and the alignment with solving business issues. </li><li>Partners with the Platform Support Team to ensure that team and platform capabilities are aligned with the vision and strategy. </li><li>Understands the capabilities of the Platform Owner and the Platform Team and, in partnership with the Platform Owner, supports change and/or additions to the Platform Support Team to improve their ability to execute the vision.</li><li>Leads and actively participates in governance meetings and activities to communicate the executive vision, alignment with the enterprise, and assurance of execution to that vision. </li><li>Manages the ServiceNow budget and coordinates budget request prioritization.</li><li>Acts as the executive point of approval authority and the final point of escalation for all decisions and policies that govern the ServiceNow Platform.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h4>3. “How can our Executive Sponsor best help us?”</h4>
<p>The most effective Executive Sponsors are usually the ones that:</p>
<ul><li>Are actively engaged in setting strategic direction for the ServiceNow team. <strong>They contribute proactively</strong>. </li><li>Effectively <strong>communicate how ServiceNow solutions can solve their peers’ business issues</strong>, citing success stories and value already realized by ServiceNow adoption. </li><li><strong>Accelerate adoption of the platform</strong> in other parts of the enterprise where ServiceNow can solve issues. </li><li>Are <strong>evangelists for ServiceNow’s potential to enable transformation across the enterprise</strong>. </li><li>Identify where and when to delegate tactical decision making and approval responsibilities around ServiceNow governance, to free time for strategic decisions and stakeholder engagement.</li></ul>
<h4><br />4. “Whom should our Executive Sponsor help us work with?”</h4>
<p>This depends on which areas of your organization are currently supported by ServiceNow, and which you think could benefit more from using ServiceNow. <strong>Use the chart below to identify key stakeholders in each business area that your Executive Sponsor can engage</strong>.</p>

<p><br />One key insight here is that all potential stakeholders listed above are in senior roles (nothing below VP or Director level) – <strong>the Executive Sponsor should not over invest time in engaging peers that are not positioned to directly recognize and act to use ServiceNow as a solution to their business challenges.</strong></p>
