<p>What is a Community? What comes to your mind when you hear ServiceNow Community?</p>
<p>Please tell us what comes to your mind when you think about ServiceNow Community.</p>
<p>Now this definition can vary depending on who you are and what your purpose is. </p>
<p>I’ve got my own definition - An online community is a group of people with shared interests who come together for a purpose to communicate, resolve issues, ask questions, working together and pursuing their interests over time.</p>
<p>Here at ServiceNow, we believe that Community is all about our members: your passions, connections, and interactions not only with each other, but this is about YOU! Help you get your business outcomes faster.  </p>
<p>Leave a comment below with a word or few words telling us what&#39;s on your mind. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
