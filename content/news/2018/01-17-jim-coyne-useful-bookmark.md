<p>Sometimes you might end up with a tab/window that only contains the main window, either with a form, list or some UI Page, without the banner and Navigator surrounding the frame.   You probably cmd+clicked a link to open a form or list in the new tab/window.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes we want to get back into the full frame UI, including the banner and Navigator.   It's easy to do, just have to add "nav_to.do?uri=" between "service-now.com/" and the rest of the URL.   But that can be a pain, so I created a <a title="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> to help.</p><p></p><p>All you have to do is create a new bookmark in your favourite browser, name it "nav_to" or whatever you want and paste the following code into the URL or Location field:</p><p></p><pre __default_attr="plain" __jive_macro_name="code" class="jive_macro_code jive_text_macro _jivemacro_uid_1516075033694549" data-renderedposition="176_8_1192_16" jivemacro_uid="_1516075033694549"><p>javascript:(function(){var url = window.location.toString();if (url.indexOf(".service-now.com") &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; url.indexOf(".service-now.com/nav_to.do") == -1){url = url.replace("service-now.com/", "service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=");window.location = url;}})();</p></pre><p></p><p>You will end up with a bookmark you can click to quickly switch you into the full UI:</p><p><img   class="image-1 jive-image" src="db471542db5c9f048c8ef4621f9619b0.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px;"/></p><p></p><p>It first checks to see if the URL contains "service-now.com" and then if it does NOT contain "service-now.com/nav_to.do".   If it doesn't, it will replace "service-now.com/" with "service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=" and then updates the URL.</p><p></p><p>Simple and effective.</p>
