<p>From the ITOM team at ServiceNow – Welcome to Knowledge18! It is the perfect opportunity to see the latest from ServiceNow and how your peers are getting the most out of the ServiceNow Platform.</p>
<p>This is an exciting time in the space of IT Operations as we have several market forces causing disruption in the traditional methods of managing operations. Firstly, to meet the needs of newer applications and lines of businesses, IT teams like to create, monitor, maintain and optimize “services” instead of individual components that make up a service. This allows the entire organization to align on common dashboards and metrics at a service level. Secondly, there is an exponential increase in the volume of data available from every component that makes up a service allowing ample opportunity for technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to learn from this data and simplify operations. Finally, teams and technologies are coming together and there is a desire in our customer base for end-to-end service management on a common platform that leverages a common data model that provides consistency across the workflow.</p>
<p>We are excited to showcase what we have planned for you. We strongly recommend that you check out all that is possible with the ITOM solution – a natural extension to ITSM that you are already familiar with. If you are dealing with service outages and would love some relief and if you would like your operations team to speak the same language as you, then explore how ITSM and ITOM together unlock solutions. The <strong>Keynote</strong> on Wednesday, May 9<sup>th</sup> will cover this in detail.</p>
<p>Begin your ITOM journey with our <strong>Pavilion Demo Booth</strong>. Look for the IT section, then the ITOM station which will be nestled within this area. We’ll be showcasing “How you can proactively reduce the number of service outages in your organization” and “How you can get to cloud faster”. Check out the demos and get your questions answered. Another must see attraction on the Pavilion floor is Now on Now, which showcases how ServiceNow manages its own operations. In the “Get to Cloud Faster” demo, find out how we enable visibility of all your cloud and on-premise resources, help you manage their health, and optimize spend across your entire IT operations.</p>
<p>Get hands-on experience with the <strong>Labs</strong> and see for real what’s possible. The labs are filling up fast so sign up soon. We strongly recommend the following labs:</p>
