<h1>Welcome Healthcare Professionals!</h1>
<h2>Your Amazing!</h2>
<p>The Servicenow Healthcare vertical has been hard at work connecting our great customers with each other to hear about the business of healthcare and the unique challenges that you are faced with everyday.  Our team is amazed by the talent, leadership, and commitment to patient excellence that we see with our customers each day.  Every decision is carefully made to support better patient outcomes, care management, and building stronger and healthier communities.  On behalf of our Servicnow team, please let me say <strong><em>Thank You</em></strong> for everything you are doing to care of patients and their families.</p>
<h2>So What&#39;s Next?</h2>
<p>This healthcare special interest group (SIG) community portal has been setup to connect customers together and provide a single portal to collaborate on ideas, industry developments, and innovation efforts in your hospital system.  The Servicenow team will be sharing content on this SIG that will foster rich healthcare discussions.  We want to make sure you are equipped with all of the Servicenow knowledge that we can find, but we also want to ensure that the information aligns with your healthcare business drivers and outcomes.</p>
<h2>It Takes a Village...</h2>
<p>The more that each of us interacts with this portal the more interesting the topics, content, and collaboration become.  Our Servicenow team will be directing all of our healthcare customers to this <strong><em>new </em></strong>portal to promote a community experience.  Just like you serve patients and their families, we want to serve you and your team by connecting you with the latest materials, discussion feedback, and real world customer examples.</p>
<h2>Thank you</h2>
<p>Looking forward to e-meeting many of you and providing a fantastic healthcare community portal engage with you and help you in your Servicenow journey!</p>
