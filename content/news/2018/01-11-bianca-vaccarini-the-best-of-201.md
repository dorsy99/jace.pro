<p>While the community is a great resource for customer testimonials and unconventional solutions around the platform, the Knowledge Base is home for ServiceNow-created content. In the Knowledge Base you can count on the information coming straight from the source. That being said, you may not always get the news you want to hear from us in the KB, as opposed to a "workaround" shared on the community. Of course, always approach with caution when venturing into <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=666d2e29dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96195e">your own customizations</a>.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="kb solutions 2017.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="2254c506db10d344e9737a9e0f9619d8.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;"/></p><p></p><h1>10 most popular Knowledge articles of 2017</h1><ol><ol><li><h2><a title="i.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0610534" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0610534">Contextual search on record producers does not work in Service Portal </a></h2><p>Service Portal is a fan favorite.

During the upgrade, group data might be unavailable to users in non-global domains. This is due to the group table being   temporarily used as the domain table. Customer Support will need to be contacted to help with this, but shouldn't be an issue in our latest release.
