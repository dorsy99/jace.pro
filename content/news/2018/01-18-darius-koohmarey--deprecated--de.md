<p>DISCLAIMER: Since this is a Share offering and not a formal in-product offering, no support or enhancements are available. This is meant as a tool to help you kick start your conversations internally around Virtual Agent technology. ServiceNow plans to offer it&#39;s own Virtual Agent as of the London release. There is no migration path between the two. IBM has rebranded their Conversation Service as Assistant.</p>
