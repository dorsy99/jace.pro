<p>Build a Genius Lounge and customers will come. That’s been the case in the Customer Success zone at Knowledge18 with ServiceNow customers stopping by to ask questions of our experts. And what questions have they been asking?</p>

<p>“We’ve been answering four for the most part,” says John, one of the experts manning the area. “What’s the problem? How bad is it? How long before I need to do something?  What do I need to do to fix it? They’re the same questions that have been asked in the past. But customers’ expectations relating to what they need to do to correct a problem have changed.”</p>
<p>According to John, many of the customers visiting the Genius Lounge don’t want to be taken through all the math. “They just want an answer. ‘Tell me how to fix it. And keep it simple.’”</p>
<p>Damien, another expert in the lounge, and his colleagues have received the same request for simplicity. Damien sees a cause and effect situation related to how the home experience has changed.</p>
<p>“Today, for the home, we have a user experience like Google maps. We have a service experience like Amazon where one can order something with just a click. Then there’s service intelligence like Netflix that predicts which shows people will want to watch based on their viewing behavior. The idea is to help simplify life. Now, people have that expectation for work and the solutions used on the job.”</p>
<p>So the experts in the Genius Lounge are ready for the trending “keep it simple” request. But just in case a customer wants all the details, the white boards and markers (and computers) are at hand, ready for action.</p>
