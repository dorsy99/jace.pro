<p><strong>Live Q&amp;A Questions during the webinar:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Is Virtual agent accessible, in regards to people with a handicap that may require equipment like a screen reader?</strong> -- Neil Link<br /> Good question. We&#39;ll have to check. Based on the recent focus on accessibility we have been placing on the platform and all products, I believe it is at least WCAG A, if not AA. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>This bot can be integrated with Skype for Business?</strong> -- Rafael Guimarães<br /> Not at this time, but keep an eye out for that connector in the future. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>hello, i&#39;m very interested in this webinar. when will the recorded webinar be available for streaming or download?</strong> -- James Vales<br /> I&#39;ll be posting the recording to YouTube and embedding it in the community in a day or two. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Where is the recording going to be located so we can rewatch this?</strong> -- William Smith<br /> Episode 59 of TechNow. Community link http://bit.ly/servicenow-technow -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>I work on a brazilian company and have interest on activating virtual agent. I&#39;m going to update to London but it works on another languages</strong> -- Fagner Favero Echer<br /> Yes, you can have the keywords that trigger the topics in multiple languages and as Stacey showed, use outputs with gs.getMessage() to easily translate them in the sys_ui_message table. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Topic: Reporting on Virtual Agent Usage</strong> -- Eric DeBolt<br /> Oooh... I like it. Making a note. Thanks for the idea. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Topic: Reporting on Virtual Agent usage. Good morning. I have been leveraging my personal developer instance to learn and develop a virtual agent. However, it appears the the tables that are required to report on VA usage are hidden. How can we report on VA utilization and other success metrics?</strong> -- Eric DeBolt<br /> I like the idea of that topic. We&#39;ll look in to it. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>We have 11 languages to support. Can we internationalize Virtual Agent - it&#39;s presentation, input (keywords) &amp; output?</strong> -- Andy Lock<br /> I know the output can be localized. I haven&#39;t checked on the input, but I&#39;d assume so since the inputs would be similar to what you use on forms as well. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Does it check if the delegate (Chuck) is available and willing to be a delegate?</strong> -- Ain Indermitte<br /> Not in this conversation that she&#39;s building. FWIW, I&#39;m always willing to be a delegate. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Thanks, How easy is it to make the Virtual Agent deploy on OOB Mobile app</strong> -- Chandra sangoju<br /> Pretty easy. The Service Portal widget is added to the page and away you go. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>does virtual agent work in domain separated environment?</strong> -- Zhonghai Yu<br /> Virtual agent has &#34;Level 1&#34; (data only) support for domain separation. Here are a few points to keep in mind when using virtual agent in London in a domain separated environment: - Branding and agent contact information (in the branding setup) use system properties. They may not be set per domain. - Live Agent Setup settings are instance-wide and may not be est per domain. - Since virtual agent is aware of the current user , it is possible to take domain into account when doing record queries within a virtual agent conversation. - When creating records using virtual agent in a domain separated environment, be sure to set company / domain. - It is possible to set conversation conditions to allow specific conversations from specific domains only. - There is no system of overrides on conversation nodes to account for domain-specific behaviors within a single conversation. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>It looks like the actions are mostly driven by options. How strong is the NLP for questions in natural language? What does it take to train the bot for NLP?</strong> -- Rajendra Velpula<br /> NLP and NLU are not available in the current (London) release. We expect those a future release real soon. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>does the chat bot have machine learning capability?</strong> -- Meganathan Chinnasamy<br /> I&#39;m going to say &#34;yes&#34; generically. I recommend reaching out to solution consultant so they can find out more about your requirements. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can the keywords in the Designer (and also other potential Language dependent options) be defined in different languages? This would be useful for non-English speakers users/customers...</strong> -- LEONARDO LOPES<br /> That&#39;s my understanding. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can VA make outbound API calls (REST or other )?</strong> -- Pete Coolidge<br /> Via the script action, yes. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Are you planning on enabling Skype integration?</strong> -- Andy Lock<br /> Keep an eye out for this in future releases. You may also enter a new enhancement request in HI. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Is there a list of supported communications platforms?</strong> -- Daniel Chamberlain<br /> In the London release, Virtual Agent may be exposed through the web interface within ServiceNow&#39;s default view or Service Portal view. It may also be exposed through integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams. Here is the docs article about messaging application integration support: https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/administer/virtual-agent/task/install-va-integrations.html#install-va-integrations -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>https://www.servicenowevents.com/knowledge2019/cfp</strong> -- Stephen Crocker<br /> Thank you! -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>We need a capability to be able to train the Virtual Agent is that available?</strong> -- SUMANKUMAR AKHILESHWAR SINGH<br /> I&#39;d be interested to have an offline talk with you about what you envision. -- Chuck Tomasi</p>
<p><strong>Is a notification created for the delegate?</strong> -- Björn Rodemund<br /> Yes. That&#39;s part of the delegate feature we covered earlier. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Could you write a test script that takes one through all the steps as you are developing your virtual agent?</strong> -- Gary Langmeyer<br /> As far as I know , Automated Testing Framework doesn&#39;t support VA at this point. I could be wrong. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Q: other than Slack, what other collaboration tools does it work with?</strong> -- frank martin<br /> In the London release, Virtual Agent supports messaging application integration with Slack and Microsoft teams. Look for this support to expand in future releases. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Keywords in one Language can mean something different in another. We&#39;d need to be careful with this</strong> -- Andy Lock<br /> Absolutely! Also, though this first release of VA in London uses keywords, I would expect that we will more sophisticated NLP capabilities in the future to identify the user&#39;s intent. The same cautions would apply with that as well, though. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Do we have to configure anything in the notfications</strong> -- Shalini Kapoor<br /> No -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>what is the integration of Virtual Agent and O365 Teams in London version?</strong> -- Beatriz Sanfrutos<br /> The integration between Virtual Agent and Microsoft teams allows conversations developed in ServiceNow to be exposed in Microsoft teams when integrated. Read about the capabilities in Docs here: https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/administer/virtual-agent/task/install-va-integrations.html#install-va-integrations -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>How do I check my installed version of SNOW? What is a link on the support site for this?</strong> -- Doug Wagner<br /> If you have appropriate permissions, you may type &#39;stats.do&#39; in the filter navigator or navigate to &#39;System Diagnostics &gt; Stats&#39; to see this information about your instance. Alternatively, when logged into the ServiceNow support site, https://hi.service-now.com, given appropriate permissions, you may see your currently installed version of ServiceNow as well as upgrade options available to you. https://staging-docs-servicenow.zoominsoftware.io/bundle/london-platform-administration/page/administer/platform-performance/concept/c_StatsToolsDiagnosticsPlugin.html -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Thanks as always!</strong> -- James Morrison<br /> As always, from all of us, you&#39;re very welcome. Thank you so much for attending. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Is chatbot integrated with knowledge Management?</strong> -- Meganathan Chinnasamy<br /> You can... all that information is available on the same system so it&#39;s available, you can create the lookup to find the right information. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>What plugins do we need to activate in a PI?</strong> -- Bud Duplessis<br /> Glide Virtual Agent (com.glide.cs.chatbot) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>How is this different than filling out a form on a website?</strong> -- Badhum Veer<br /> It&#39;s a different channel they can use and you can do auto-fulfillment (e.g. offer up a solution immediately). In this case, it&#39;s basically the same as filling out a form, but consider a customer looking for knowledge information (PDF) or other request info. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>In the first attempt you had create_delegate_record rather than create_delegate_record_we_created</strong> -- James Higgins<br /> Thanks. I really do appreciate your catching this and wish I had seen it when doing the demo the first time! :-) An extra set of eye is always a good thing. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Is there a pre-built agents that we can use as template?</strong> -- Peter Velinov<br /> There are several conversations available for you to use as templates and this is an EXCELLENT way to learn about building sophisticated conversations. See https://staging-docs-servicenow.zoominsoftware.io/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/administer/virtual-agent/reference/prebuilt-topics-ITSM.html In https://developer.servicenow.com, if you have a personal developer instance, you may enable these ITSM, CSM, and HR conversations. (Manage Instance &gt; Enable Plugins) After these conversations are activated, you should be able to preview each and duplicate it to make a copy of your own. From there, you can test out customizing and extending those conversations while exploring how they&#39;re built and some of the conventions used. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Ordering something from the Service Catalog should be high value I believe.</strong> -- Gary Langmeyer<br /> Perhaps. Virtual Agent can also be used to order items. It&#39;s just another channel to start the request. It doesn&#39;t go around the existing process. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>what if you have 10 people with the same first name? does the window with options expand?</strong> -- Michael Bachmeyer<br /> Yes. It displays the results to choose from. -- Kreg Steppe<br /><br /><strong>Does the user have access to their chat history?</strong> -- Rebecca Doll<br /> Good question! I am able to see my previous chat history for the past several days in the virtual agent web interface. After scrolling up a bit, I saw a message that it was loading more history. I don&#39;t see a property to control message retention timeframe, though. In Slack, my message history was also visible to me. I assume that would be subject to the same message retention policies as regular chats in Slack. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>The code for name returns 10 results. What happens if the name i type happens to have more than 10 results? Is there a &#34;view more&#34; or would a second prompt have to be entered to further filter?</strong> -- Ayla Lo<br /> We could certainly code it to do that. It would not happen automatically, though. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Are OotB conversations available in all supported languages?</strong> -- Björn Rodemund<br /> In spot-checking several of the OOtB conversations, it appears they are available in English only for the London release. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>More important is how Virtual Agent can be made more and more intelligent using Watson Assistant to be able define intent and entities to be able to fullfill the work reqeusted using the Iterate Test Train and CAllibrate the bot.</strong> -- SUMANKUMAR AKHILESHWAR SINGH<br /> We are planning to incorporate in-platform natural language understanding and natural language processing with Virtual Agent. Stay tuned... -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Does this provide remote troubleshooting into customer PC or laptop</strong> -- Chandra sangoju<br /> Potentially. I could see a use case for a conversation set up like that. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>is there any OOB conversation available as part of plugin</strong> -- Chandra sangoju<br /> Yes. ITSM, HR, and CSM are available depending on which you activate. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>How difficult is the setup for the Slack integration?</strong> -- Rebecca Doll<br /> It is not difficult at all. There is a menu option for Messaging Apps Integration. From there, select Install, provide a workspace URL, and authorize the application. No code required for the installation. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>how do we know that user would choose a particular topic?</strong> -- rahul pasnoor<br /> The topics displayed are currently driven by keywords. The user then chooses the appropriate topic based on that. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Password resets</strong> -- Richard Null<br /> Yes! This is one of the most common ones. Thankfully, it is also one of the conversations included in the ITSM Virtual Agent Conversations avialable in London. What a time-saver this could be. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Regarding solving the computer problem, why ask &#34;which computer your have&#34; when this information is (or should be) known to the &#34;system&#34;? We should never ask questions that we already know the answer to (things like your name, computer type, office location, etc.)</strong> -- Ain Indermitte<br /> I agree. It&#39;s all about the context. The system already knows who you are, so it knows what you own, where you are located, etc. Take advantage of that. it might be more helpful to ask &#34;is this the computer you are inquiring about&#34; to verify. (Stacey&#39;s note: If there IS only one computer assigned to the user, the Virtual Agent is smart enough to ask for confirmation. It only shows the option to select which one if multiple are found.) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>I was referring to the emails... delegate may not want all the emails...</strong> -- Valeria Giddings<br /> :-) Agreed and understood. Delegates must know what&#39;s coming their way as a common courteousy. I took a few liberties in the demonstration as a bit of a joke. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Can users access this bot outside of SNOW or do they need to go to SNOW?</strong> -- Ashish Fadnavis<br /> We currently offer connectors to Slack and MS-Teams - she&#39;s going to demonstrate Slack in a bit. Watch for more connectors in future releases. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>how to add date validation like end date shouldn&#39;t be before start date</strong> -- AJAY SINGH<br /> That could be done easily with a decision action on the conversation. We haven&#39;t shown that here for time, but it could easily be done. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>What if the same keyword is configured for multiple topics? How do we get the correct bot?</strong> -- Calvin Rawls<br /> I believe it would offer the matching topics and ask the user to select the one they wish to use, in that case. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Will you guys give us a sample letter that we can write to our managers to sell them on going to the knowledge event?</strong> -- Tristan Dietz<br /> I know we used to provide it on knowledge.servicenow.com. Keep you eye there. If you don&#39;t see anything in the next few weeks, send me an message technow&#64;servicenow.com -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Thanks, good presentation!</strong> -- Björn Rodemund<br /> You&#39;re very welcome, Björn. We hope to see you at future webinars. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Nice presentation and resource.</strong> -- Rafael Guimarães<br /> Thank you, Rafael! We hope you enjoy putting the Virtual Agent to use in your organization. See you at future webinars! -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Can we get much time we save by using VA. time it takes for VA to resolve a question</strong> -- Shalini Kapoor<br /> Yes, it does take time for VA to resolve a question. However, Virtual Agents may help dozens or hundreds of users in parallel 24 hours a day. That&#39;s a difficult scale to match with humans. With VA handling those conversations, you can spend your time on more complex challenges. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Is there an more than one ITSM bundle or just Professional</strong> -- Patricia Nichols<br /> Just one at this point that I&#39;m aware of, but work with your account team to find out for sure. We tend to be more technical and don&#39;t always get product/pricing information. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can you ask and have user answer multiple questions at same time?</strong> -- Charles Michel<br /> They are asked in series at this point. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is there any VA Dashboard or Report that shows metrics related to VA? E.g.: number of issues solved by VA, number of issues assigned to a Live Agent, number of issues VA &#39;did not have the knowledge&#39;, ...</strong> -- LEONARDO LOPES<br /> I have not seen anything like a Dashboard or Report, but agree with you that that would be EXCELLENT insight to have in order to quantify the value being provided as well as identify the need for additional / more sophisticated conversations. I would encourage you to submit this as an enhancement request in HI, outlining the types of analytics that would help you, as a customer, to drive your business regarding Virtual Agent adoption. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Would it be possible to catch exceptions, for example, when you&#39;re trying to create a duplicated delegate record? Thank you</strong> -- Hugo Loredo<br /> Oh, absolutely! For this demo, we have very limited time, so we needed to keep this very simple. However, this type of exception handling would be great to add. (Note, though, in this particular use case, that overlapping dates may be appropriate. I may want one person to handle approvals and another to handle tasks while I&#39;m out. The inspection for duplicates would need to include duplication of options as well.) -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>do we need to take all scenarios in to consideration....this is like building workflows all over again, as we dont what user might request for</strong> -- rahul pasnoor<br /> Rahul, I think the key point here is that we start with the &#39;low-hanging fruit&#39; rather than trying to handle everything. As this capability evolves, the virtual agents will get smarter and smarter. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Created a catalog item for the users and the use of it increased.</strong> -- Helen Coburn<br /> Very cool idea! -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>many requests for how to connect to printer</strong> -- Kathy Chisefsky<br /> That&#39;s a good one! Also, since we know where the user is located, the virtual agent can take that into account when confirming which printer the user is trying to connect to. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>If we run multiple portals can we customize the agent per portal? Or is this global.</strong> -- Joshua Cassity<br /> I believe the virtual agent is global at this point. It can use conditions to determine which topics are available to users, though. I&#39;m not sure if you can somehow use that to identify which portal a user is in, though. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>can you have a version of VA for internal agents vs external customers.... or rather how to you seal off topics for external vs open them up for internal</strong> -- Mathew Xagoraris<br /> Yes, you can secure the conversation by roles. Using snc_internal or snc_external role (or any other role) to determine who can access which conversations. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>How can you handle exceptions in the virtual agent? For example if someone writes a name that does not exist. Or Writes a long sentence just to report the name like &#39;I want to be covered by Michael&#39;</strong> -- Agni Galicia<br /> You can evaluate with a decision block. We didn&#39;t have a chance to show that yet, but it&#39;s an easy thing to do. (Stacey&#39;s note: I&#39;ve also had success using Regex to try to parse out specific information from longer user responses.) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Do users need to know what virtual agent to engage or is there an uber agent that connects the user to the right agent?</strong> -- Paul Boch<br /> The agent is global for the instance. It&#39;s all about which conversation topics are activated. For example, if you have the CSM conversations turned on, the virtual agent knows CSM. If you also enable HR conversations, the virtual agent knows both CSM and HR. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>can we pull data from other services using an API call inside that flow?</strong> -- Badhum Veer<br /> Absolutely! There is great flexibility when using the Script step to call external (or other internal) APIs. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Can the delegate approver unsubscribe from notifications?</strong> -- Valeria Giddings<br /> It&#39;s my understand that subscriptions are honored. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is the Virtual Agent an additional cost?</strong> -- Russell Park<br /> I believe Stacey covered that. It&#39;s part of the bundles mentioned. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>For a domain separated environment, how can the Agent information be customized for each domain?</strong> -- Vishal Sharma<br /> Here is some more detailed info on Virtual Agent and Domain Sep. http://bit.ly/2QN1BbS -- Kreg Steppe<br /><br /><strong>We have Chuck Tomasi. He has been assimilated. We are the Virtual Agent!</strong> -- Joshua Cassity<br /> I wish! -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>What does &#34;Meeting invitations&#34; mean/do?</strong> -- Michael Bachmeyer<br /> For delegation... you can set up ServiceNow to send meeting invites (e.g. change request blackouts, etc.) We covered this about a year ago on TechNow. :) -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Still unsure how to set up keywords per language.</strong> -- Andy Lock<br /> Enter them in the keywords. Add all the options you like at the same time. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Which programming language experience is required for VA functions development?</strong> -- Mithun C<br /> Javascript would be required, though I will say that there is excellent sample code included. In future releases, look for Virtual Agent Designer to move more towards low-code and no-code. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Can we create our own conversation...lets say for HR</strong> -- Shalini Kapoor<br /> Absolutely. We encourage it. Everything Stacey is building is done net-new. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Do we need separate license to enable this feature?</strong> -- Kavitha Raydurga<br /> It&#39;s part of the ITSM, HR, or CSM Professional Bundles. Stacey covered this at the beginning of this section of the presentation. You are welcome to go back and watch or reach out to your account team to have a deeper discussion on pricing. Thanks. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>I&#39;m sorry :) my question was is there any available OOB Conversation available for giving ability Remote Troubleshooting into customer PC</strong> -- Chandra sangoju<br /> Not OOB that I&#39;m aware of in this release. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Wonderful, thanks!</strong> -- Denis Doucet<br /> We&#39;re very glad you found this topic useful and hope to see you at future TechNow webinars. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>This was an awsome demo and it was particularly excellent watching Stacey do the live development</strong> -- Maria Leader<br /> Thanks so much, Maria! We&#39;re very glad you found this topic useful and hope to see you at future TechNow webinars. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>thank you, the presentation was very good!</strong> -- Anderson Sousa<br /> We&#39;re very glad you found this topic useful and hope to see you at future TechNow webinars. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Do we see this being used only for the SNOW platform or can it be used for completely different use cases?</strong> -- Ashish Fadnavis<br /> I&#39;d love to hear more about your use case ideas! -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Beside the knowledge that is included in the process flow, is there any artificial intelligence in the system to learn from user&#39;s past responses?</strong> -- Syed Asrar Ahned<br /> Not in this first release, but given ServiceNow&#39;s recent aquisitions, I would expect us to be moving in that direction. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>is there an ITSM Virtual Agent dashboard?</strong> -- Darrin Mason<br /> I don&#39;t believe so at this point, but I&#39;d encourage you to submit an enhancement request in HI outlining what types of analytics would be helpful for you to see on such a dashboard. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Do we have virtual agent designer available in the demo dev instance?</strong> -- Krishna Katepalli<br /> Personal Developer Instances have this available. You need to activate the plugin from the Developer Portal. I believe the name is Glide Virtual Agent. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can we also invoke a REST/SOAP webservice for a flow to integrate with an external (to SNOW) application?</strong> -- Ashish Fadnavis<br /> It allows scripting capabilities, so the answer is yes. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can the delegate get this Delegate Card during the process so they have the details?</strong> -- Denis Doucet<br /> You could easily set up a notification to be triggered on the creation of a new delegate record. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can you show off how it looks in Teams?</strong> -- Randall Batz<br /> Sorry. Given that the webinar is only an hour long, we didn&#39;t get to this. You can set up Virtual Agent (and the sample conversations) in a personal developer instance and test the integration with Teams fairly easily, though. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Similar to {{user}}, are there any other variables that can be used within the text input? Without having to jump into the script</strong> -- Abdul Ismail<br /> I&#39;ve looked pretty hard and Chuck investigated as well. At this point, in the London release, we believe this is the only one. Remember that this is a glide record, so you can dot-walk to any information associated with the current user, like their location, manager, department, etc. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Thanks you all for organizing this session</strong> -- SUMANKUMAR AKHILESHWAR SINGH<br /> You are very welcome. We love to learn and share. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>How about you use Virtual Agent to answer questions here? :-)</strong> -- Ain Indermitte<br /> Brilliant! -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>was just suggesting some of the low value, repetitive tasks that were asked.</strong> -- Brian Shaw<br /> thanks -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>How does the ITSM subscription compare to a regular ITSM Fulfiller subscription when we got PA licenced as well?</strong> -- Björn Rodemund<br /> Unfortunately I don&#39;t know the answer to this. I recommend you work with your account team. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Is Virtual Agent a OOB functionality from London? Do we need to activate any plugin?</strong> -- Valeria Giddings<br /> It&#39;s available in the London release and requires licensing (covered earlier) with ITSM, CSM, and HR Professional Bundles. Plugins are activated upon purchase like other value-add options. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>if you select your name from table to delegate is it smart enough to identify that?</strong> -- Preetam Barai<br /> OOB, her lookup didn&#39;t do that, but you easily add a decision that checks it quickly, adds a &#34;try again&#34; message and loops back for another attempt. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Are topics domain separated, or can topics be available based on user criteria?</strong> -- Kourtney Brewster<br /> I don&#39;t believe topics are domain separated. However, each topic has a condition field that is evaluated before the topic is made available to users. It would be possible to script a condition that takes the user&#39;s company or domain into account when determining if a topic is available to a user. I don&#39;t believe user criteria is supported to determine whether a topic is available to a user. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Can I create a standard requester (already configured) using this bot?</strong> -- Rafael Guimarães<br /> You can use it to create records, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>&#34;If you&#39;re on PTO...&#34;. What is PTO?</strong> -- Susie Woodward<br /> Paid time off. Thanks for asking for clarification. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>will there be an integration plan for Cisco WebEx Teams? (competitor of MS Teams and Slack) If yes, what is the timing.</strong> -- Jennifer Martin<br /> I haven&#39;t heard on that specific connector yet, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not going to happen - just that I haven&#39;t heard about it yet. If you like, I invite you to submit an enhancement request on HI. Our product managers DO listen. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Are there plans to use machine learning with Virtual Agent in future ServiceNow instances?</strong> -- Amanda Rantala<br /> Yes. Machine learning and Natural Language Processing/Understanding. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>What would happen if the query on the sys_users table returns no records or if the results returned are not correct? Thank you.</strong> -- Hugo Loredo<br /> You can set it up to prompt again. Great use case for a decision tree. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can we integrate virtual agent into company intranet portal?</strong> -- Mithun C<br /> Interesting question. We&#39;ll have to check and find out options. iFrames seem like a possibility. Authentication might be a bigger issue. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Do you have APIs to construct the virtual agent conversation - i.e. not have to do this through the UI</strong> -- Mahesh Kumar<br /> I haven&#39;t heard about anything like that at this point. If you like, I invite you to submit an enhancement request on HI. Our product managers DO listen. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>High Frequency - Password Resets for various applications though self service protals are available the users are requesting for thsi very ofthen. WE also have Virtual Agent application but still the users are requesting to log the ticket</strong> -- SUMANKUMAR AKHILESHWAR SINGH<br /><br /><strong>I&#39;m seeing here we have a MS Teams logo. Is there a integration?</strong> -- Fagner Favero Echer<br /> Yes. -- Kreg Steppe<br /><br /><strong>Can the branding/VA profile be different by Company (in a Domain Separated instance) ?</strong> -- LEONARDO LOPES<br /> Branding is instance-wide rather than domain-specific. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>How would something like the date choices work if integrated with Microsoft Teams?</strong> -- Patrick Canary<br /> The UI for MS Teams allows you to change one component (day, month, year) at a time, then it updates. It&#39;s not a date/time widget like we have with the web client. Slack is similar, but slightly better. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>A more serious question: if the person (#1) assigns you (#2)as a delegate, but you have assigned someone else (#3) as a delegate, does that third person become a delegate to the first person?</strong> -- Ain Indermitte<br /> My understanding is that delegation is only &#34;one level&#34; deep and the two level scenario you described is not going to work as planned. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>Can you access the virtual agent from other sites beyond Service Portal? Use case: Access the Virtual Agent from my public website for customer service management.</strong> -- Matt Miller<br /> At this time the methods for accessing it are the built in web client, Slack, and MS-Teams. Each has a method of authentication/connection to ServiceNow instance. I&#39;ve heard plans that more connectors are coming. Stay tuned. -- Chuck Tomasi<br /><br /><strong>How can we support virtual agent in a global environment? Do you we have to set up in multiple languages</strong> -- Shalini Kapoor<br /> I would suggest that you test this out in a personal developer instance. The bot responses use getMessage to facilitate translated responses. I would assume other elements may be translated as well, but encourage you to test this out and talk to your ServiceNow account rep. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Are the interactions stored into a table somewhere?</strong> -- Blake Bowers<br /> Yes, but it looks as if the back-end tables are protected. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>will you get conversations for Customer Services</strong> -- Mathew Xagoraris<br /> There are 3 conversations pre-built for Customer Service Management as part of the CSM Professional Bundle: - Check Case Status - Get Help with a Product - Get Help with an Order -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Does the bot chat with only active employees or can we set it up for alumi users of a company?</strong> -- Shalini Kapoor<br /> That&#39;s a good question. I would assume that alumni would no longer be able to log into the company instance of ServiceNow. I am not sure whether public access is supported or how that would be handled from a licensing perspective. I&#39;d encourage you to talk to your ServiceNow representative about your particular use cases. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /><strong>Virtual Agent can handle approval process?</strong> -- venkata Ramesh Rayavarapu<br /> Absolutely! As part of my learning (though there is a pre-built approvals conversation), I built a conversation that queried for all outstanding approvals for the current user. I allowed them to preview the record and link to it in a separate tab. After asking for their disposition (approve, reject, or skip) and allowing them to provide a comment, I asked if they wanted to review more. If so, I looped back to the query. It&#39;s an excellent use case to start learning about VA. -- Stacey Bailey<br /><br /></p>
