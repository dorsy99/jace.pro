<p>This past year, I had a lot of business travel. While travel is not a new thing, I&#39;m still a fairly lightweight business traveler. I regularly achieve the first tier status for my preferred airline each year, but never higher.</p>
<p>This year was different. For the first time, I had moved into the mid-tier. The new benefits make the time stranded in airports as a result of often delayed or sometimes canceled flights worth it.</p>
<p>The feeling of elation was short-lived. Last week, I received an email from my airline. As I had only recently completed a trip that moved me up to the next tier, I expected this to be a congratulatory email. Instead, it sent me on a path trying to find explanations to questions I thought I already knew the answers to. Why? A lack of thorough customer journey mapping, disconnected departments and processes, and poor self-service options.</p>
<h2>Disconnected processes</h2>
<p>The email stated I could maintain my newly attained status in 2019 if I would like; it would just cost me. I thought I had read prior that status achieved in a given year would be held for the year attained through the end of the following calendar year. I followed the link in the email to see what additional information I could find.</p>
<p>Looking back, this was a clear breakdown in process. Whichever department sent out this email (perhaps marketing or the loyalty team) had not targeted the correct customers.</p>
<h2>Hit-and-miss self-service</h2>
<p>I followed the link in the email. It took me to a landing page that offered the option of extending my status for several hundred dollars. This part of the journey was working as intended, but it wasn&#39;t what I was looking for. Nowhere on the page could I find an answer to my question or a link to FAQs.</p>
<p>I abandoned this route and logged in to my mileage account to verify my status. Maybe I had miscounted the miles I had needed. No, my calculations were correct, and my account reflected my new tier. Unfortunately, no answer was to be found here. </p>
<p>My next stop was customer service. Certainly, I could find the answer in a knowledge base, FAQ, or elsewhere. No, the closest I could find were pages explaining the airline&#39;s different tiers and the benefits at each, all lacking the complete terms and conditions. It was time to initiate a chat ... but none was offered.</p>
<p>In this leg of my unexpected journey, the airline had missed the ball for self-service. Though they offered some rudimentary cross-site search, no true knowledge base exists. I can&#39;t imagine I was the first seeking information about their mileage program terms and conditions. They were missing a huge opportunity to provide easy answers to common questions. The lack of chat–automated or with a live agent–was also a lost opportunity at faster, lower cost service.</p>
<h2>Going guerilla</h2>
<p>By this point, I had given up on the airline&#39;s website. It was time to take my question broad. I went to my search engine of choice and typed in my query. And I got an answer.</p>
<p>Well, I got several answers, in fact, as is typically the case. Unfortunately, none of the answers affirming my suspicion that I would have my new status through the end of 2019 came from the airline itself. Several of the top answers were from well-known and respected travel blogs, so I was reassured–but still not 100% certain. It was time to reach out to customer service.</p>
<h2>The final option</h2>
<p>Though my attempts at self-service with the airline had failed, I had some confidence from the third-party information I had found. I emailed customer service with my question, as well as details of the email that had put me on this course. I added how I had tried to find an answer myself, but their lack of a knowledge base and chat had forced me to take the email route. (A little unsolicited feedback.)</p>
<p>About a day later, I received my response. As the other sources had indicated, I would have the status through the end of 2019. The agent apologized for the confusing email I had received. She went on to say this was a new practice and apparently something had gone wrong. No comment was made on the lack of self-service options or any plans for the future to prevent any much misleading emails, but hopefully, my comments would find the right ears.</p>
<p>As is often the case, customer service had to clear up confusion –but they weren&#39;t completely without fault. This was a mess caused by another department proactively sending an email to the wrong customers. Customer service wasn&#39;t aware this was happening, but they also had failed to make the tools and information available that might have prevented me from needing to contacting them. </p>
<h2>Fear and doubt</h2>
<p>The airline intended their email to be useful information. Instead, it ended up backfiring in two ways: it temporarily removed my joy of the new status <em>and</em> caused effort on my part to find the answer. It also exposed some flaws in their customer self-service options.</p>
<p>This could have been avoided. Their customer segmentation was flawed. Customer service wasn&#39;t aware of the emails and the timing of their delivery. Easy-to-find self-service answers to the most likely customer questions arising from the email were missing. This represents the lack of a complete end-to-end journey map and also exposed the airline&#39;s need for improved cross-departmental customer focus.</p>
<p>Brands attain loyal customers through many things, among them useful products and services, great customer service, and the actions they take as a business. We collectively call this the customer experience and companies are fighting to be leaders at it. That extra free checked bag and occasional seat upgrade that come with a higher status are appreciated, but when a company is creating more problems for its customers than it solves, this poor experience leads customers to consider other options.</p>
