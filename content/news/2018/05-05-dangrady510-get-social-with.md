<p>Knowledge18 is upon us.</p>
<p>This year the conference will host over 18,000 professionals who are looking to transform how work gets done at their organizations.</p>
<p>Knowledge is always a great opportunity to get inspired by how your peers are leveraging the Now Platform and learn about best practices and new capabilities.  It also provides an environment for networking and collaboration.</p>
<p>This collaboration takes place in person and online on social sites like Twitter(#Know18).</p>
<p>We thought it would be fun this year to use some of the capabilities of the platform to monitor and analyze those social conversations on Twitter.</p>

<p>Leading up to and throughout Knowledge we&#39;ll be capturing all of the tweets(and retweets) that contain #Know18, #ServiceNow, or #Knowledge18.  We&#39;ll use standard reporting to rank the most active handles on Twitter and track overall volume.  We&#39;ll use Performance Analytics to trend the activity over time and do some word frequency analysis of the tweets themselves.</p>
<p>Periodically, we&#39;ll be tweeting out different aspects of the data like the word cloud and the leaderboard for most active.  If you are interested in the data we&#39;ll be using the hashtag #PANOW as part of the tweets or you could always follow me &#64;tweetgrady but that will also expose you to the occasional pictures of my kids, meals on the road, and general analytics articles and conversations.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about how we are capturing and analyzing the data or Performance Analytics in general please stop by the booth in the Pavilion.  I know myself and the rest of the team would love to network in person as well as online.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all at Knowledge - enjoy the conference.</p>
