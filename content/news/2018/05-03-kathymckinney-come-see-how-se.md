<p>At ServiceNow, we like to say that we “drink our own champagne.” What does that mean? It means that we use our products to run our own business. We consider ourselves to be Customer Zero, the first enterprise to implement ServiceNow innovations before we make them available to the public. We call this Now on Now. This year at Knowledge18, you can see more than 30 demonstrations of Now on Now implementations presented by the experts who created them.</p>
<p>If you’ll be at Knowledge18, be sure to stop by the Now on Now booth in the Knowledge Pavilion to meet the experts, ask questions, and see real-world examples of how ServiceNow is making work, work better for people.</p>
<p>Visit us in the Pavilion on <strong>Tuesday, May 8 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; and Wednesday, May 9 and Thursday, May 10, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</strong> (unless indicated otherwise below). We’re excited to show you how we “drink our own champagne.”</p>
