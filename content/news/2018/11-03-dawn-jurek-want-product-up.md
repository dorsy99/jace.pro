<h3>What are Deskside Chats?</h3>
<p>When you want the latest information, you go to the source, right? What if the source was brought to you? Or even better – what if experts sat down to share their knowledge about the product with you? That’s the inspiration behind our new Deskside Chats series. We go right to the source—the developers and product owners who build and manage ServiceNow products—and have them bring you the latest updates and answers to frequently-asked questions circulating on the Community. The people in charge of building the products you use every day, sitting down to directly answer your questions – you can’t get any better than this!</p>
<p>This series is the brainchild of two of our own ServiceNow product managers, <u><a title="Darius Koohmarey" href="community?id&#61;community_user_profile&amp;user&#61;84501629db581fc09c9ffb651f961932" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Darius Koohmarey</a></u> and <u><a title="Manjeet Singh" href="community?id&#61;community_user_profile&amp;user&#61;a7009625db581fc09c9ffb651f96195a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manjeet Singh</a></u>. Each week, they’ll bring a new insight into the platform, whether it’s a new feature they’re excited to share with you or an update in an existing product that you should be aware of. As such, they will be kicking off our series with new updates for the IT Service Management products. As the series progresses, they will be featuring other product managers to converse and dive into other business unit products and features the platform has to offer customers.</p>

<p>Episodes run between 3-5 minutes to cover as much high-level material as possible, while still keeping it light and engaging for you. Depending on the content or popular request, several videos may be produced to cover a specific topic. And always, we will provide links to other resources—including documentation, blog-posts, KB articles, podcasts, and tutorial videos—in the description of each episode if you&#39;d like to take a deeper dive.</p>
<p>In our first episode, Darius discusses the latest updates and questions revolving around ITSM Virtual Agent:</p>
