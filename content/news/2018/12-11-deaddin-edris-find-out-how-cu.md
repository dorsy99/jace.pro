<p>To ensure organizations are getting the most out of their ServiceNow investment, we deliver regular upgrades that provide new features, increased stability, and higher performance. With this in mind, we recently commissioned a study by Forrester Consulting on the benefits of staying up to date with our latest release.</p>
<p>In the study, Forrester interviewed several customers with years of experience using ServiceNow. These customers have a consistent upgrade approach, and their process was compared with the approach of not upgrading regularly. What did we find? Customers who stay current can expect:</p>
<ul><li>Faster and easier upgrades</li><li>Reduced time to build out new functionality</li><li>Increased productivity from quicker release of new functionality</li></ul>
