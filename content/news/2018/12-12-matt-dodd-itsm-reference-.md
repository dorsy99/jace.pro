<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Just wanted to point out some great resources for you all in relation to best-practise frameworks and how to leverage them in your ServiceNow implementation. The two links below are to some short video&#39;s explaining more; </p>

<p>The documentation ebook for the reference guide is also available for download here on the community in the IT Service Management forum at the following address:</p>

<p>Spoiler alert - extract from the introduction of the article:</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>ITSM Reference Architecture</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #808080;">Traditionally, IT Service Management (ITSM) practitioners have been left to their devices when it comes to harmonizing industry best practice frameworks with their technology stack. By design, best practice frameworks and industry guidance tend to be technology agnostic, which introduces a layer of subjectivity when it comes to practical implementation. With thousands of highly successful ITSM implementations worldwide, ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to provide prescriptive guidance with regard to implementation, upgrades, and value realization within the context of these industry best practices. As a customer-driven organization, we continually build best practice learnings into the product while delivering supplemental guidance using a variety of channels (e.g., Customer Success Center, ServiceNow communities, eBooks, white papers, podcasts, etc.) so that customers can consume it based on individual preferences.</span></p>
