<h4><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-style: inherit !important; font-weight: inherit !important;">Wayfair has an extremely mature and well-defined DevOps culture in which the company was built on; and this introduced challenges on how to enable ServiceNow as the core platform for their production operations.</span> <span style="font-style: inherit !important; font-weight: inherit !important;">Learning how to integrate multiple ServiceNow modules into the CI/CD pipeline and aggregate operations with deployments was key to getting a holistic view of how business services are performing. Having a single hub for all of the data allowed Wayfair to build KPI’s that are much more relevant to a DevOps world—focused around agility and failing fast.</span></p>
<p>In this webinar, <strong>Tameem Hourani</strong>, <strong><span style="font-style: inherit !important; font-weight: inherit !important;">Head of Production Operations at Wayfair</span></strong>, showcases how to:</p>
<ul><li>Maximize your DevOps journey by moving fast, iterating faster, and bypassing gatekeepers</li><li>Accelerate your digital adoption by integrating ServiceNow with existing open source toolsets and frameworks</li><li>Leverage existing tools to be able to extend and create applications onto the ServiceNow platform</li></ul>
