<p>If you&#39;re a developer working at an ISV (Technology) Partner or a Services Partner with product (off the shelf app) business aspirations, please check out this blog post that explains the purpose of the <a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;c34b776fdbd91b4058dcf4621f961904" rel="nofollow">ISV Track at the Global PartnerNow Summit. </a></p>
<p>It&#39;s a nice complement to the hands on technical sessions at CreatorCon - if you&#39;re a developer looking to get the big picture on Now Platform strategy and roadmap,  ServiceNow Store, and OEM channel for global distribution and sale of off the shelf pre-packaged apps this is the track for you.</p>
