A Management, Instrumentation, and Discovery (MID) server offers a direct, secure solution. It&#39;s a Java application that runs as a Windows service or UNIX daemon on a server in your local network. You can communicate and move data faster, easier, and more securely between a ServiceNow instance and external applications, data sources, and services. Join Chuck Tomasi, Kreg Steppe, and Stacey Bailey of ServiceNow for an introduction to this powerful, versatile tool.</p>
