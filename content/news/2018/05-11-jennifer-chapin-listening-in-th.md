<p>The Customer Success zone at Knowledge18 was created out of a simple action: listening to customers. “Customers have been asking us for the best ways to make the most of their ServiceNow investment,” says ServiceNow Success Center Content and Programs Leader Karen Cangialosi. “The zone helps us achieve that goal, making customers aware of the things we’re doing at the company now and will do in the future to help them achieve their business success.”</p>
<p>That applies to all areas focusing on customer success whether it’s professional services, customer success management, product documentation, training and certification, or just answering questions.</p>
<p>And questions and answers are everywhere in the zone that includes 1:1 success clinics for developing a solution and business roadmap, the Genius Lounge for technical issues, and four theatres that will host more than 80 presentations over the three-day Knowledge event—all geared to customer success.</p>
<p>“We’re anticipating 10,000 people will walk around and participate in the zone, meeting with our experts,” says Karen. “It’s a really fun and engaging experience—different than what we’ve done before at Knowledge.” A visitor leaving one of the success clinics agreed. “It was awesome.”</p>
<p>The Customer Success zone is just one part of an expanded program to ensure, as the name indicates, ongoing customer success working with ServiceNow.</p>
