<p>We won’t have a local SNUG event this quarter, so instead please join us at the upcoming Now Summit on October 18th at the Santa Clara Convention Center to learn how to deliver great experiences at work for your employees and customers. Discover what’s now and next for IT, HR, Customer service and security.</p>
<p>Why attend? Just like SNUG events, the Now Summit is the place to learn, connect, and get inspired by ServiceNow visionaries, customers, and partners. This complimentary one day program offers keynote presentations, education sessions, access to our partner ecosystem and additional networking opportunities in ExpoNow. Discover how ServiceNow can help you deliver great employee and customer experiences.</p>
<p>SNUG members please stop by to pick up your ribbon after you pick up your badge and attend the cocktail reception sponsored by SNUGs to meet and collaborate with peers!</p>
