<p>Does customization of your ServiceNow implementation add value, or add complexity and cost?</p>
<p>The answer is yes (maybe), and yes (maybe). The <em>point</em> is that customization can add to the value you realize from ServiceNow, but it can also create additional cost due to testing and potential technical debt. Customization should always be &#39;business-smart&#39;:  the value that any customization delivers should outweigh its potential complexity and cost. </p>
<p>Knowing what&#39;s business-smart is a matter of good governance. We recommend building a scorecard to help evaluate new demands for customization (and configuration) for <strong>value</strong>. You can use a simple 1-to-5 scoring framework, as shown below, that your demand managers can use to make this evaluation.</p>

<p>You can then put your <strong>value </strong>scores alongside a rating for complexity/cost. We&#39;ve done that for you, in the table below, using common customization and configuration scenarios.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that you should apply cost-benefit analysis to get to business-smart customization. The more complex or costly your customization, the more value it needs to deliver for your enterprise.</p>
<p>Good governance shouldn&#39;t stop here. To make this work, you need:</p>
<ul><li>Clear processes and responsibilities for demand evaluation and management</li><li>Clear design guidance for development teams, particularly around scoped applications</li><li>Regular reviews - even &#39;audits&#39; - to ensure that the customizations you&#39;ve implemented still deliver on a clear business need</li></ul>
<p>And don&#39;t stop at a scorecard or process level. Interview your agent and rep teams -- the teams working in ServiceNow regularly -- to find out if the value <em>intended </em>by customization or configuration is actually realized in day-to-day experience. Involve your service desk agents and reps in the definition of what&#39;s business-smart:  it&#39;s not just what&#39;s in the original request for customization, but in whether you&#39;re truly realizing value in action.</p>
