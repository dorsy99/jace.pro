<h2>Sometimes, you find yourself lost in the woods and need a map and compass to work your way out...</h2>
<p>In  <a title="Part 1: Getting Out of the Woods of Business Service Resource Mapping (Service Mapping Kingston Release)" href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;d50e517adb3997005322f4621f9619f4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">part 1 of our Service Mapping blog series</a>, we talked about the new approach of mapping your organization&#39;s broad set of services in parallel. But attempting mapping in high volume means there is a likelihood of a correspondingly high volume of mapping errors produced. How can the mapping administrator possibly contend with such an overwhelming challenge? Fortunately, in the <a title="Service Mapping Kingston Release" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-operations-management/page/product/service-mapping/reference/c_ServiceMappingOverview.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kingston release</a>, we have provided a corresponding new approach to handling these bulk mapping errors in order to help navigate administrators through a disorienting forest.</p>
<p>The first step in dealing with a large number of mapping errors is to organize them into more manageable groups. <a title="ServiceNow Service Mapping" href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/service-mapping.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Service Mapping</a> has six top-level categories into which it segregates all errors, such as general Service Mapping configuration errors, network access errors, and missing or otherwise insufficient credential-based errors. The tile for each category indicates the count of error instances in that category. Drilling down into each category reveals several sub-categories as well, such as missing Windows credentials <em>vs</em> missing SSH credentials, again indicating the number of error instances in each. This narrows the problem space for the administrator down to actionable chunks and guides the administrator to the areas they can tackle early that will yield the most sizable gains.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="01d201fcdbee1b0067a72926ca96197f.iix" /><br /><em>These are the six top-level categories presented in logical progression order.</em></p>
<p>As for taking corrective action, the approach is to attempt to resolve one instance of an error within a sub-category, and once successful, apply that resolution to the entire group. For example, there may be a group of targets for which there is no MID server configured to cover their IP address range. Correcting a MID Server&#39;s IP Range assignment should take care of a large number of error cases; but before rerunning the mapping step on all errors in that sub-category, it is helpful to test one instance first.</p>
<p>To help guide the administrator to that effective corrective action, each error includes a human-readable error description, identifies the endpoint where each error was observed, and presents instructions on what may be done to resolve it (including links to product documentation pages, knowledgeable articles, etc.). The Service Mapping UI even provides links to carry out some corrective actions right there without leaving the context of the error sub-category. All of this informs and enables the administrator to remove blocking issues swiftly. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="4db30178db225b0067a72926ca961928.iix" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here is one example of drilling down into a category to see sub-categories.</em></p>
<p>Once change has been made, the UI provides controls to rerun the mapping to see if the change was sufficient to resolve that error. If it is, the UI indicates that the error has been successfully resolved and prompts the administrator to retry all instances in that category. This is a big efficiency boost for the IT staff, amplifying their efforts across a large problem set to achieve the largest gains for the organization out of the shortest amount of time spent.</p>
<p>Now that we see how groups of errors can be eradicated in short order, there is another dimension to selecting which categories to take on first, beyond just the error count in each category. Experience has shown that resolving early mapping stage errors in any given service usually uncovers additional downstream errors in subsequent mapping stages of that service—errors that couldn&#39;t be tested until getting past the initial error. Just as my mother taught me about vacuuming my way out of a room to avoid retreading already-vacuumed carpet, it wouldn&#39;t be efficient to start with addressing later stage error categories only to rehash those categories after resolving earlier stage issues.</p>
<p>For example, resolving MID Server IP address range configuration errors can uncover network access errors that weren&#39;t previously detectable until a MID Server began attempting access to targets in those IP ranges. If you take on the network access errors category first, you&#39;ll likely have to return to it after addressing the MID Server configuration errors. Service Mapping assists here by displaying the top-level error categories in a logical progression order, from early mapping stage errors to latter stage errors. This helps the mapping administrator be more efficient; but importantly, it also helps her or him optimize the involvement of domain experts to resolve problems in the various categories.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s walkthrough an example:</p>
<ol><li>Here, you see instructions provided for an error within a sub-category (see &#34;View Instructions&#34; button on the lower right):  <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="6bf3cdbcdb225b0067a72926ca9619c2.iix" /></li><li>Back on the errors list, based on the nature of this error, the UI provides a recommended action for editing MID Servers... <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="5414c130db625b0067a72926ca96194b.iix" /></li><li>...which opens this form without leaving the error list context: <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="be148530db625b0067a72926ca961929.iix" /></li><li>After taking corrective action and returning to the errors list, select &#34;Retry <a title="ServiceNow Discovery" href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/discovery.html" rel="nofollow">Discovery</a>&#34; for the one error (and it indeed resolves the condition). You will be prompted to &#34;Retry All&#34;: <img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="7a24c930db625b0067a72926ca9619dd.iix" /></li></ol>
<p>Finally, to organize the resolution efforts among potentially different teams with different domains of expertise, there are task assignment options using ServiceNow&#39;s inherent task management mechanism (as well as a way of marking errors as &#39;assigned&#39; when using external means of task assignment). The assignees will receive email notifications with links to their list of assigned errors, and all parties have complete visibility into the progress of the work.</p>
<p>This redesigned approach to bulk error handling, within the overall new bulk mapping methodology, will turn your forest of IT resources into groves of useful service maps, accelerating your organization immensely toward improved incident and outage handling, change reviews, security vulnerability management, and data center migration planning.</p>
