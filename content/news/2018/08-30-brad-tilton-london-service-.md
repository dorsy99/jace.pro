<p>Many of our ServiceNow store apps include Service Portal pages and widgets, or at least interact with the Service Portal in some way, so I wanted to go a little deeper and call out some of the new Service Portal related features and enhancements that came with the London release. All of these can also be found in the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/service-portal-rn.html" rel="nofollow">Service Portal release notes</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-user-interface/page/build/help-guided-tours/concept/guided-tours.html" rel="nofollow">Guided Tours for Service Portal</a></strong><br />Create a guided tour for a <span class="ph">Service Portal</span> page to guide users through the content step by step. Users access a guided tour by navigating to a page that has one. When a user accesses a <span class="ph">Service Portal</span> page that has a guided tour on it, no GTD panel is present. Instead, the <img id="guided-tours__image_x2c_kxf_d2b" class="image" src="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-user-interface/page/build/help-guided-tours/image/gtd-tours-button.png" alt="Show users how to launch a Service Portal tour" /> menu item appears on the banner indicating a tour is available. If a blue icon with ellipses appears, more than one tour is available. When the user clicks <span class="ph uicontrol">Tours</span>, all available tours for the page appear. <br /><strong>Note: </strong>By default, tours can only be manually launched from pages that use the SP Header Menu. For instances upgraded to <span class="ph">London</span>, the Guided Tours for <span class="ph">Service Portal</span> feature <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-platform-user-interface/page/build/help-guided-tours/task/activate-guidedtours-service-portal.html" rel="nofollow">has to be activated</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-application-development/page/administer/auto-test-framework/reference/atf-service-portal.html" rel="nofollow">ATF for Service Portal</a></strong><br />You can now write automated tests to validate Service Portal forms and include those in your app. The following test step types are available:</p>
<ul id="service-portal-rn__ul_j31_4z3_xdb" class="ul"><li class="li">Open a <span class="ph">Service Portal</span> form</li><li class="li">Set field values on a form</li><li class="li">Validate field values</li><li class="li">Validate field states</li><li class="li">Check UI action visibility</li><li class="li">Click a UI action</li><li class="li">Validate form submission</li></ul>
<p><strong>Search Enhancements</strong><br />You can now paginate search results and limit the number of results shown at one time in order to improve performance. You also have the ability to use <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/search-service-portal.html#d433345e183" rel="nofollow">Search Facets</a> to enable end users to filter search results in more meaningful ways. Facets can return results based on fields in a table or query conditions, and can be used to filter both simple and advanced search sources. You can define facets for advanced search sources using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Facet generation script</span> on the search source record, and use facet APIs to create facets and assign <span class="ph">ServiceNow</span> facet items or mapped queries to the facet.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/reference/client-script-reference.html" rel="nofollow">Validation Scripts in Service Portal</a></strong><br />You now have the ability to run validation scripts in Service Portal. In new instances, <span class="ph">Service Portal</span> includes XML, Script, Script (Plain), Email, and Version validation scripts by default.</p>
