Those are recurring themes for the London release of the Now Platform®.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Virtual Agent</h3>
<p><img src="742040aadb502f081cd8a345ca9619ce.iix" /></p>
<p>Why not increase customer and employee satisfaction using intelligence for everyday work? The new ServiceNow Virtual Agent lets you instantly execute millions of simultaneous high value conversations with your customers, partners and employees - any time they want. As a conversational chatbot solution, Virtual Agent captures inquiries, transactions and conversations within a simple messaging interface so users can instantly obtain information, get decisions and instigate actions – all facilitated by an automated agent. Pre-defined conversations are available out-of-the-box for ITSM, HR and CSM. Or, develop your own custom conversations to cut down on manual agent service time. Either way, you’ll be delivering a consistent and scalable user experience across preferred messaging channels with support for multi-media options to reduce text and increase efficiency. With the new Virtual Agent, your users will enjoy more timely and mobile friendly interactions for unparalleled levels of service.</p>
<h3>Enhancements to Flow Designer and IntegrationHub</h3>
<p><img src="e8608caadb502f081cd8a345ca961988.iix" /><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="undefined.iix" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/platform-flow-designer.html" rel="nofollow">Flow Designer</a> and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/integration-hub.html" rel="nofollow">IntegrationHub</a> help make connecting your enterprise even easier! In London, Flow Designer provides the ability to trigger a flow from the Service Catalog, much like you would a graphical workflow. With new out of the box integrations for MetricBase and Event Management, Flow Designer can be used as an action framework, making flows extensible for other applications. This allows you to create codeless flows for automated triage, remediation and work processing to address service and event outages. And, with sub-flow support, admins and developers can create reusable blocks of actions, providing a faster way to do more modular designs. Subflows are composed of inputs, outputs, actions, and flow logic and can be nested within a flow with other subflows.</p>

<p>With IntegrationHub, you can enable easy integrations for seamless workflows and collaborations, both inside your enterprise and out. Pre-built integrations called “spokes” can be used by non-coders to connect codeless flows and extend interactions to third party services. London brings out of the box spokes for Azure Active Directory and Active Directory services. It also supports PowerShell to build spokes for automating more Microsoft services.</p>
<h3>Now Actions App for Slack and Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p><img src="a671cceedb502f081cd8a345ca9619f7.iix" /></p>
<p>If you already collaborate with your team using Slack, say goodbye to switching between Slack and ServiceNow to get work done. Now, you can approve or reject a request notification right from within your Slack channel so you can keep working in the channels your team already uses. You can also get your ServiceNow notifications for incidents, tasks, and other events in your Microsoft Teams channels you use every day. The Teams integration spoke allows you to approve requests or get information and updates directly in Teams from any ServiceNow record. Set up notifications to be sent automatically to specific channels for real-time updates and contextual team collaboration. Configure actionable messages to send to specific team members to approve or reject a request. So, collaborate how you’d like with these new Slack and Teams integrations.</p>
<h3>Integration and Usability Enhancements</h3>
<p>And finally, there are some helpful updates involving <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/service-portal-designer.html" rel="nofollow">Service Portal</a>, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/guided-tour-designer.html" rel="nofollow">Guided Tour Designer</a>, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/agent-intelligence.html" rel="nofollow">Agent Intelligence</a>, and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/metric-base.html" rel="nofollow">MetricBase</a>.</p>
<p>Service Portal is offering new integrations with Guided Tour Designer and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/servicenow-platform/automated-testing-framework.html" rel="nofollow">Automated Testing Framework</a>. Guided Tour Designer now has full support for Service Portal so you can create customizable guided tours for any Service Portal page - including forms, reports, and applications. Guided tours remain in draft mode by default so tours can be edited by numerous people, shared, and previewed without yet being live. And, you can also now use Automated Testing Framework to test applications and user experiences that are built in Service Portal before they go live so you can make sure all functions work prior to deployment. We’ve also enhanced the search function with Faceted search which provides unified search across service catalog and knowledge allowing you to access information organized by applying multiple, dynamic filters.</p>
<p>For MetricBase, we’ve expanded the types of triggers. Instead of one, we now have three. The first is the standard band trigger we introduced in Kingston. When a threshold is met, a trigger is fired. Next, is the linear predictor trigger which allows you to fire the trigger based on predictions you make. For example, if the temperature metric is trending to a threshold, you might want to know about it before it gets too hot. Then, we have the gap trigger to take action when you stop receiving data for a given metric, such as when an IoT device goes offline.</p>
<p>Agent Intelligence now offers international language support for Japanese, French, German, Spanish, and Dutch.</p>
