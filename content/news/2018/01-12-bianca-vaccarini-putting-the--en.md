Plus, you can plan the deployment process of your releases in phases. It's what the team considers a sister to the standard Release Management. If you are new to the ServiceNow platform I would suggest working in Enterprise Release Management - it's like the new and improved Release Management.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="enterprise release management.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" height="282" src="6afff371db58d3049c9ffb651f961962.iix" style="height: 283px; width: 786.816px;" width="787"/></p><p></p><p>Enterprise Release Management allows release managers to model their release processes without disrupting other areas of the business.</p><p></p><p>Three aspects of Enterprise Release Management:</p><ul><li>Enterprise release</li><li>Deployment</li><li>Product release</li></ul><p></p><p>You can turn on Enterprise Release Management by navigating to <strong>System Definitions &gt; Plugins.</strong></p><p></p><h2>Enterprise Release</h2><p>Enterprise release is the backbone of Enterprise Release Management in Kingston. With this feature your organization can specify the duration, short description, and priority of a release phase. From start to finish you can track the amount of time and effort put into a release with <strong>planned</strong> fields and<strong> actual</strong> fields.</p><p></p><p>In Enterprise release management you can start the phase off with the number of planned resources needed such as planned start date and end date. As the release phase wraps up, you can mark the actual time and effort put into deploying the release. It also allows milestone sign-offs to use the standard workflows in the platform. The difference between a phase and a milestone is that the <strong>Milestone</strong> field has an end date, whereas phases have a start and end date. Future phases cannot start unless a milestone has been met. This allows for hyper control over the quality of your release.</p><p></p><p><img   alt="enterprise release management2.jpg" class="image-2 jive-image" height="386" src="d40e118edb5c1b04ed6af3231f96191f.iix" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 386px; width: 792.038px;" width="792"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Enterprise Release Management is like "the project of getting a release out-the-door."</em></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Define Deployment Phases</h2><p>With Enterprise Release Management, you can create a deployment phase with test plans and task templates. In the Deployment phase, you can assign builds to a specific group. To ensure quality of your release, set and <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-business-management/page/product/enterprise-release-management/task/create-test-plan-enterprise-release.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-business-management/page/product/enterprise-release-management/task/create-test-plan-enterprise-release.html">run a test plan</a> on a build within a deployment phase so your quality team have a complete and consistent test plan to follow. Once you find a deployment flow that works, you can<a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-business-management/page/product/enterprise-release-management/task/create-deployment-task-template.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-business-management/page/product/enterprise-release-management/task/create-deployment-task-template.html"> create a task template</a> to copy over to future builds and deployments.</p><p></p><p>Deployment pipelines are for modeling continuous delivery pipeline. It established exactly what a build needs to do from one phase to the next with the use of:</p><ol><li>Test plans</li><li>Manual tasks</li><li>Approvals</li></ol><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="ERM.jpg" class="image-3 jive-image" src="c52d7c0adbdcdfc068c1fb651f961967.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 472px;"/></p><p>All test cases within a test plan must pass, all manual tasks must be close-complete, and one person in the assignment group must approve for a release to move to the next phase. If there is one task that goes incomplete or test that fails, the phase will not move forward until all are green.</p><p></p><h1>Product Releases</h1><p>After the execution of a release comes communicating it to those in your inner circle and outer circle. Marketing has always been a second thought for project teams. If you don't have a release to share what is there to market, right? Well, within Enterprise Release Management, the product release is a part of the conversation. Track aspects of your release product with the release date and the new or updated features in each of the products.</p><p></p><p>It's the "marketing around getting a product of a release out the door. It is useful to track the to-do list to ship a release out to customers."</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>I'm really interested to see how you all use Enterprise Release Management to better manage their builds across the organization. Especially giving your marketing team visibility and capability to track their own product releases... Can someone say "breaking down silohs?"
