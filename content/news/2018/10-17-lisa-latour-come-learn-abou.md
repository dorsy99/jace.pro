<p>We&#39;ve got another ask the experts event for you.. <span class="ng-scope">we&#39;ll be covering ITSM&#39;s Common Services Data Model (CSDM). </span></p>
<p>The Common Services Data Model (CSDM) represents a shared set of service related definitions that span the ServiceNow® product portfolio and the Now® platform. They are being standardized to ensure (1) accurate service reporting, (2) consistent use of standard terms and (3) to provide more prescriptive guidance on service modeling. The data model includes the recommended mappings for the service related tables and CI class mappings. The initial model focuses on ITBM, ITSM, ITAM and ITOM. However, the model accounts for customer extensibility and future versions will include Customer Service Management (CSM), Human Resource Service Delivery, Security Operations (SecOps), GRC along with the Internet of Things (IOT).</p>
