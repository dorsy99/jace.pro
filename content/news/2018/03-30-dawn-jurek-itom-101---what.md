<h2>What is ITOM?</h2>
<p>IT Operations Management in ServiceNow is a suite of applications that work together to automate operations management within your organization. </p>

<h2>What is Discovery?</h2>
<p>Discovery uses a process called horizontal discovery to find applications and devices on your network and the important attributes of those devices. It updates the configuration management database (CMDB) with the information it finds, but does not draw relationships between Configuration Items (CI) that are part of specific business services.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">  </p>
<h2>What is Service Mapping?</h2>
<p>Service Mapping provides a complimentary capability to Discovery, by using top-down mapping to find and map CIs that are part of a business service, such as an email service. This allows you to visualize all CIs that are used to deliver a service. </p>

<h2>Event Management and Operational Intelligence</h2>
<p>Event Management and Operational Intelligence help your IT team monitor the health of the system, anticipate and prevent outages, and resolve issues quickly, with minimal impact to your operations.  </p>

<h2>What is Event Management?</h2>
<p>Event Management collects and analyzes events to identify and prevent potential service outages.</p>
<h2>What is Operational Intelligence?</h2>
<p>Operational Intelligence collects and analyzes performance metrics to identify and prevent potential service outages. It uses historical threshold data to indicate anomalous behavior of CIs which may not be captured by events.</p>
