<p>As we unpacked our box of product sheets and set up our demo laptop we had no idea that UPM·X and Designer would soon be playing an important role in the successful merger of two of Europe’s premier asset management companies <a title="Aberdeen Standard Investments" href="https://www.aberdeenstandard.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aberdeen Standard Investments</a>.</p>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>It was at IRM UK where we met Steve Hale, enterprise architect for Aberdeen Asset Management. Steve and the enterprise architecture team were working in a legacy IT landscape that had become fragmented. And in anticipation of future mergers they expected that the fragmentation would only get worse. The pressure was on to find a full-featured combined <strong>Enterprise Portfolio Management (EPM)</strong> and <strong>Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM)</strong> solution that could help Aberdeen’s management easily share information across the organization and inform their planning and decisions with direct access to real-time data.</p>

<p>In addition to finding a way to access data across a patchwork of legacy systems, Steve and the architecture team were looking specifically for these three capabilities:</p>
<ul><li>Cataloging, to document the as-is business taxonomy, applications landscape, and deployment ontology,</li><li>Dashboarding, to provide real-time information to stakeholders with easy to use export capabilities, and</li><li>Diagraming, to develop blueprints and enable comparison of potential future state scenarios.</li></ul>
<p>In our initial conversation we shared with Steve how the ins·pi enterprise architecture suite offered the comprehensive solution that would help his team provide management with visibility across legacy systems and support the data-driven environment they were looking for. We also laid out our 6-step process for design-driven enterprise transformation. These six steps provide the framework for how we would work together through product testing and evaluation.</p>
<h3><br />Proving the Concept</h3>
<p>After initial consultations, Steve and the architecture team at Aberdeen undertook a proof-of-concept (POC) of UPM·X and Designer. Aberdeen’s data-heavy repository was transferred into the ServiceNow environment and their catalog loaded into UPM·X. <br />During the 12-week POC stage the team put UPM·X and Designer through their paces, testing real-life scenarios and exploring different ways to work with their own data. The team produced dashboards and dynamic reports then demonstrated to management the comprehensive export and self-serve features of their installation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Until we implemented UPM·X and ServiceNow our reporting was passive. It took a team of people to collate data from different parts of the IT organization to produce static reports. Now IT management can see that there are service incidents on an application and follow likes to the architecture collateral... Management now has access to a real-time enterprise-wide view.” — <em>Steve Harker, Chief Architect</em></p>
<h3>Increasing Productivity and Efficiency</h3>
<p>At the end of the POC stage the team measured a <strong>200% increase in productivity</strong> due to the single, unified platform UPM·X provides and the advanced diagramming and modelling capabilities of Designer. Both management and the enterprise architecture team saw the benefits of information bottlenecks being opened up and decisions informed by better data.</p>
<p>Two months after completing the POC the team at Aberdeen received authorization to take UPM·X and Designer into production. The implementation took six weeks to complete.</p>
<p>A month after implementation Aberdeen announced its merger with Standard Life Investments. Within six months the two companies completed their merger and became Aberdeen Standard Investments with a combined £670 billion (€737 billion, US$871 billion) in investment and pension assets under its management. Designer was in place throughout the merger providing management the visibility into the enterprise’s as-is and to-be models. The insights drawn from the real-time enterprise-wide view helped to insure a successful merger.</p>
<p>In the time since the merger, managers now have direct access to dashboards with dynamic filtering and drill down capabilities. It’s library has grown to over 500 diagrams, all of which are accessible enterprise-wide. And, after internal training, its internal team of enterprise architects using UPM·X and Designer has grown to more than 50. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Architecture is now maturing to support and influence decisions earlier in the process. We’re using our knowledge of our environment and our experience to look at the complexity of change and to present the pros and cons of different scenarios to management. We’re documenting these scenarios in UPM·X and Designer so there is a record of why design decisions were made and what alternatives were considered.” — <em>Steve Harker, Chief Architect</em></p>
<h3> Discoveries</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Cultural Change</strong> – A lot of people were used to baselined Excel sheets, Visio Diagrams and large PowerPoint documents to capture information and use at meetings. We have used UPM·X &amp; Designer as a chance to shift this behaviour and use the system to display our up-to-date understanding, on screen during meetings. Updates can then be incorporated immediately.</li><li><strong>Popularity</strong> – Architects were quick to see the value and we on-boarded the architects from the start. But the merger went through after we had been live for about 3 months, so we had a large new population keen to get access too. </li><li><strong>Amount of information</strong> – Quickly hit 500 different diagrams, so had to adapt to make it easier to find what we were looking for.</li></ul>
<h3> Business Impact</h3>
<ul><li>We have cut the time of the as-is discovery phase in projects</li><li>Information bottlenecks have been removed</li><li>An easily accessible single source of truth</li><li>Better informed decisions, those decisions are then updated and visible</li><li>Real-time data access</li><li>Can replace weekly meetings with the built-in workflow</li><li>Able to remove MKS, Sparx EA and Visio from the Architect toolkit</li></ul>
<h3>Ask the Expert</h3>
<p>Join us Monday, April 23, 2018 - 8:00 AM PT on a hands-on demonstration &#34;<a href="community?id&#61;community_question&amp;sys_id&#61;0f62bdb9dbdd5b483882fb651f9619df" rel="nofollow">Learn how to use Designer to create your future service landscape</a>&#34; of how to</p>
<ul><li>create visual diagrams and models based on real-time ServiceNow data,</li><li>create future state elements (CI&#39;s) without changing the ServiceNow repository, and</li><li>kick-off processes and workflows directly through your diagrams.</li></ul>
<p>This demonstration will include a discussion around implementation best-practices, and there will also be time for questions and answers at the end.</p>
