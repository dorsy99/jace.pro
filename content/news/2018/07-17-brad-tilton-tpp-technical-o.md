<p>Attention Technology Partners!</p>
<p>We&#39;re pleased to announce the launch of TPP Technical Office Hours, an open conference call occurring every other week where technology partners can speak directly to a partner architect about any architectural or technical questions with respect to developing an app for the ServiceNow Store. This will be an open, shared session for all technology partners who would like to attend.</p>
