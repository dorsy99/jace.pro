<p>Our Knowledge mobile app is ready for you to download.  It has everything you need to know including your personal agenda, maps and notifications.  <a href="https://webapp.spotme.com/login?email&#61;&amp;branding&#61;sesaa17&amp;source&#61;install&amp;install_instructions&#61;true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Download it now!</a></p>
<p>2. Know Before You Go Email</p>
<p>In the next 24 hours, all attendees will receive an email with final information that will be helpful prior arriving at Knowledge.  Make sure to keep an eye out for this in your inbox!</p>
