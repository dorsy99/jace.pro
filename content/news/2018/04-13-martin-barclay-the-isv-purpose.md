<p>So what&#39;s the purpose of the ISV Track you ask? Let me break it down for you:</p>
<p>  </p>
<ul><li><strong>WHY</strong><br />Inspire &amp; motivate ISV partners to capitalize on the ServiceNow vision and achieve success at scale<br /><br /></li><li><strong>WHAT</strong> <br />Drive partner innovation on the Now Platform to build intelligent apps to transform the future of work<br /><br /></li><li><strong>HOW</strong> <br />Best practices on what to develop and how to market and sell intelligent apps on the Now Platform via the ServiceNow Store and OEM channel</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The track will be kicked off by Avanish Sahai, WW VP ISV/Technology Alliances and Josh Kahn, GM Platform BU.  Then we have a line up of ServiceNow ISV experts who will walk you through all the latest news on routes to market, Store and OEM product roadmaps, and how to market your apps to grow your pipeline - including the unveiling of a new Store Publisher Portal app marketing solution.</p>
<p>And for the first time this year, we are excited about the closing session: a customer-partner success panel where our ISV sales leaders will host a panel featuring Vertex Pharmaceuticals-Nuvolo and Murdoch University-Factor5, who have adopted ISV apps that have delivered concrete results to their businesses and that extend the Now Platform into new, broadly applicable, high impact solution areas and buyer groups that complement and extend ServiceNow.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you all in person, catching up with old friends and making new ones! See you in Vegas!</p>
