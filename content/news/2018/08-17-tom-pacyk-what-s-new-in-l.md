<p>The Performance Analytics release for London is focused on delivering better experiences for everyone, by ensuring powerful analytics are accessible and prescriptive. Out-of-the-box content specifically tuned for ServiceNow applications continues to complement the real-time, embedded analytics that guide everyone towards better outcomes.</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of the highlights from London that are generally available, and a quick look at a few exciting enhancements currently in our Limited Access preview program.</p>
<h3>Dependency Assessment</h3>
<p>Trying to understand the full impact of a change to an indicator, breakdown, or dashboard widget was historically a tedious process, but architectural relationships and dependencies can now be explored through a visual map provided by <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/performance-analytics/concept/impact-analysis.html" rel="nofollow">Dependency Assessment</a>. This feature allows administrators to implement changes with confidence, by understanding the end-to-end impact of a change <em>before </em>it happens.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Dependency Assessment Tree View</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p>The tree view automatically surfaces relationships between objects all the way from specific dashboard tabs and widgets down to a breakdown or indicator source, streamlining common actions and troubleshooting tasks for Performance Analytics administrators. Users can drill upwards or downwards from any node in the hierarchy to explore connected objects, or even launch contextual actions like previewing an object or running data collection jobs without leaving the screen.</p>
<h3>Spotlight</h3>
<p>Based on customer feedback, we’ve made <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/performance-analytics/concept/spotlight.html" rel="nofollow">Spotlight</a> — our weighted scoring engine for prioritizing work — even easier to set up and use, just in time for the London release! Spotlight now allows you to collect scores on the schedule you need, <em>and</em>you can set a unique schedule per Spotlight Group. You can choose from standard Daily, Weekly, or Monthly frequencies, or you can use the new ‘Periodically’ option where the job is repeated after a specified number of days or hours.</p>
<p>We’ve also added the ability to launch Interactive Analysis directly from a Spotlight Group, so you can immediately preview and explore the results. There’s no longer a need to build a dashboard full of widgets before digging into the records under Spotlight.</p>
<p>Lastly, we’re excited to share that we’ve added detailed logging for each collection run, removed the need to manually create database views, and now support domain separation with Spotlight.</p>
<h3>Detailed Scorecard Enhancements &amp; Insights</h3>
<p><em>Note: These two features are only available through a Limited Access program for the London release, but we’re looking forward to everyone getting their hands on these enhancements in the near future.</em></p>
<p>The Detailed Scorecard has been refreshed and improved with a new look and functionality, logically spread across three different tabbed sections to help you explore, compare, and predict performance. The visual styles have been enhanced with a modern look and we’ve incorporated the breakdowns panel into the <strong>Overview tab </strong>so you can easily explore and slice historical, current, and future scores.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="067b0594dbc82380b2102926ca961998.iix" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The new Detailed Scorecard</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p><strong>T</strong><strong>he Compare tab </strong>allows score differences to be analyzed between two dates, so you get visibility into which records overlap and those that are unique for each date. Benchmark comparisons are also now available directly within the Detailed Scorecard when you link an indicator to a benchmarking indicator.</p>
<p>The most exciting change here is the new <strong>Insights tab, </strong>which digs into your data to surface emerging trends and data anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed. A timeline of key scores, relative to your target goals and forecasted performance, is displayed across the top while What’s on the Move shows the positive and negative changes that have recently occurred at the indicator or breakdown level. These new highs, lows, or changes in momentum are usually hard to identify without manual analysis, but What’s on the Move saves you time by automatically surfacing these highlights to your dashboards.</p>
