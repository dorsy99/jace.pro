For instance, you need to be ready to respond to unplanned events and changes to business services. For these reasons, combined with ServiceNow Platform, IT operations Management brings real-time intelligence to ensure service visibility, health, and optimization.</p>
<p>As enterprises embrace multi-cloud and serverless resources, IT operations need complete visibility into these environments. You should be able to understand the changes in serverless environments and the business service they impact. After gaining complete service visibility, you can understand the health of these services while leveraging machine learning to investigate the root cause of the issues. At the end, it’s all about improving MTTRs by remediating service issues quickly.</p>
<p>IT operations also gets better experience with a unified UX to correlate events, launch incidents, and remediating them much faster from one place, enhancing service optimization.</p>
<p>Here are the top capabilities in London that address some of the biggest challenges for IT operations in the areas of service visibility, health and optimization.</p>
<h3><strong>Service Visibility</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Discover Kubernetes clusters</strong>: Discover resources deployed in a Kubernetes clusters such as container images, pods, services, etc. With this, you have full visibility of changes taking place in Kubernetes clusters deployed on AWS, Azure, and VMware environments. CMDB is updated with the right configuration data after Discovery runs and finds changes in the Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: Dependency view of a Kubernetes cluster</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discover and map services running on multi-cloud environments: </strong>Discover all the IT resources running on AWS Application Gateway, AWS Lambda, Azure Application Gateway, and Adobe ColdFusion. This gives you a much-improved ability to track changes and incidents in the AWS and Azure environments.  In addition, configuration data about services and resources is always synced with the CMDB.</p>

<h3><strong>Service Health Management </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Faster root cause analysis and remediation with Alert Intelligence:</strong> you get a better user experience for analyzing alerts, visualizing changes, and driving remediation of problems – all from one workspace. This workspace correlates event sources and metrics data to pinpoint root cause using machine learning. In addition, it helps drive resolution leveraging past actions for similar issues. <strong>This is a limited access feature in the London release.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 3: Alert Intelligence enables root cause analysis and faster resolution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Faster alert rule creation and automatic actions with Alert Management: </strong>You have a superior rule designer to manage rule definitions, define alert conditions, and set remediation actions via Flow Designer, IntegrationHub, and external applications. It replaces the Alert Action Rules feature. This improved user experiences speeds up resolution of the affected CIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="9255f639db08ab0467a72926ca9619f9.iix" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 4: Step-by-step guided approach to creating alert rules</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dynamic search capability to visualize performance using Advanced Insights Explorer: </strong>Using Insights Explorer, you can visualize performance of their IT resources by searching the dynamic metric data across multiple CIs. Insights Explorer is the new name for Metrics Explorer.</p>
<p>Advanced Insights Explorer provides you an improved user experience to create performance reports using raw metric values and calculated anomaly scores prevalent across several CIs. The outcome is a much faster identification of performance issues that are widespread in your IT environment.</p>

<h3><strong>Service and Cloud Optimization </strong></h3>
<p><strong>AWS GovCloud support: </strong>IT operations can now use ITOM for GovCloud out of the box. You can use it across Discovery, Event Management, Operational Intelligence, Cloud Management and Orchestration with confidence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IT operations can accelerate business outcomes with intelligent data that helps them solve service issues faster in the on-premise and cloud environments. Join our launch broadcast to learn first-hand and engage with experts.</p>
