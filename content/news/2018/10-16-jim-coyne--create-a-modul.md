<p> </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a nice little addition to the System Property Category form - a Related Links UI Action which will create a new Module to display the list of System Properties linked to the particular System Property Category:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Once the user confirms the creation of the Module, they are re-directed to the new record to fill in the remaining information:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I keep forgetting the format of the Arguments field and always ended up copying and pasting an example so decided to automate the creation of the Module instead.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve attached an XML file so you can just import it into your instance. As always, try it out in your company&#39;s development instance first, or better yet, your own personal development instance.</p>
