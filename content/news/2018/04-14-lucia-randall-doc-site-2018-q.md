<p>We have spent the past 3 months working on improvements to our product documentation site <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/" rel="nofollow">docs.servicenow.com</a>. The below are features we just launched and are ready for you to try them! </p>
<ul><li><strong>Autosuggest</strong>: A new &#39;Autosuggest&#39; capability matches the word or phrase searched against topic titles to return improved results. </li><li><strong>Did you Mean</strong>: The &#39;Did you Mean&#39; capability now understands misspelled words (single and multi-term) and provides you with search results for the corrected words. </li><li><strong>Clustering</strong>: The site now has a search clustering feature that shows you all available versions and products inline for each search results. This allows us to provide more search results on the first page. </li><li><strong>Re-directs</strong>: When content moves around bookmarks break. The new re-direct functionality takes you to the moved topic. If that happens to fail, maybe the topic has been removed, you will land on the search page with search results for similar topics. </li><li><strong>New 404 page</strong>: Hopefully you never see this page but if you do, we have added a search bar so you can quickly try again. </li></ul>
<p>We hope these improvements help you in your search for information. Please send us your feedback or comments at <a href="mailto:docfeedback&#64;servicenow.com" rel="nofollow">docfeedback&#64;servicenow.com</a></p>
