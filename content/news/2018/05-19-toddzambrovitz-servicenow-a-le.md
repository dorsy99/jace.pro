<p>Application backlogs are driving innovations in how applications are built and who is able to create them. That means that roles such as business analysts and line of business process owners are beginning to develop and deliver their own solutions. The Now Platform provides a do-it-yourself role-based development environment that lets you quickly and easily assemble and configure highly functional applications with little or no coding. That means everyone can participate in transforming how companies work by delivering Intelligent Apps that execute and connect any service, task and data on any device from anywhere with a consistent consumer-like service experience.</p>
