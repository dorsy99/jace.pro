<p>From my colleague, Tom, who thoroughly enjoyed himself at the event!  Enjoy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sure, you come to Knowledge to learn, connect, and be inspired to help transform your business. But we know the real reason you attend: the tchotchkes.</p>
<p>After all, who wouldn’t want a stress ball, foam finger, tote bag, key chain, candy, and pen, pen, pen? This year, all those items are available, plus a few unique ones.</p>
<p>One ServiceNow partner is offering a Viking hat that lights up and a Viking doll. Another has a variation of the pen tchotchke. Push a button and a plastic container transforms into…ta-da… a pen.</p>
<p>There’s the shot glass as well as a Blackjack help card—appropriate for Las Vegas. And, if you get into line fast enough, you can pick up a portable cell phone battery charger.</p>
<p>So, the question is, what’s the strategy behind all the different types of tchotchkes? Ask any of the people at the partner booths and you’ll probably get the general answer of building and maintaining awareness.</p>
<p>Some companies have put a bit more thought into the choice, tying their tchotchkes to what they do. For example, the Viking hat comes with the company’s promotional theme of “Conquering spend management.” The transformer pen? The company is in the business of “transforming IT.”</p>
<p>In the words of one company representative, “You need an item that people will put on their desk or in their golf bag, providing a constant, gentle reminder of your company. It needs to be for the attendee. Give something for the kids and it will disappear once the attendee takes it home. And it must be something that will last. Pens run out of ink.” What does that representative recommend? A stress ball or a golf club cover are two choices.</p>
<p>In the words of another representative: “It must be something attendees can easily fit into their pocket, especially if they’re flying. If it’s too large, it could end up in the hotel trash can.” That company is offering the shot glasses and Blackjack help card.</p>
<p>No matter the strategy, the Viking hat that lights up takes this year’s prize for the most talked about piece—worn by attendees, including blog writers.</p>
