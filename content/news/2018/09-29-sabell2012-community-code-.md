<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: MY POSTINGS REFLECT MY OWN VIEWS AND DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF MY EMPLOYER, ACCENTURE.</p>
<p>DIFFICULTY LEVEL:   <strong style="color: red;">ADVANCED<br /></strong>Assumes good intermediate level knowledge and/or familiarity of Orchestration and Integration in ServiceNow.<br />____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Awhile back the ServiceNow Orchestration development team pushed out a little known &#34;release&#34; to the ServiceNow Share: <strong>The Orchestration Integration Packs</strong>.  I decided to dust these off and bring them back out into the light again.<br /><br />These are unsupported Orchestration integrations developed by ServiceNow (and were likely intended to be released as support packs).  Instead they were released for us out on the Developer Share!<br /><br />Okay, so what does this mean?  It means we get a lot of really great content pre-written for us.  This includes both activities and workflows to accomplish a significant number of tasks for a large number of integrations!<br /><br />Are these supported by ServiceNow? A big NO here.  Since these are out on the Share they are all use-at-your-own-risk.</p>
<p>This means that if the documentation isn&#39;t attached to the Share download you are out-of-luck.  All of these lack use-cases, and example how-to&#39;s.</p>
<p>Frankly, these are all gems<br /><br />What are the integrations?</p>
<ul><li>Artifactory</li><li>Bitbucket</li><li>Docker</li><li>Git</li><li>IIS</li><li>JBoss</li><li>Jenkins</li><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Nexus</li><li>Nginx</li><li>SalesForce Orchestration</li><li>SQL Database</li><li>Tomcat</li><li>Weblogic</li><li>Windows Folder ACLs</li></ul>
