<p>We launched our <a href="community?id&#61;community_blog&amp;sys_id&#61;566c6ea1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96195b" rel="nofollow">unified search experience on HI</a> last year as a way to bring all of our technical information in one place. We want our unified search to provide all of the results you need in one place, rather than hopping from tab to tab. Toward this goal, we have recently included the Developer Site (developer.servicenow.com) in the search results.</p>
<p>This addition enables you to find all of our Developer site documentation including:</p>
<ul><li>API reference material</li><li>Developer documentation</li><li>Training material</li></ul>
<p>All from the search you are already familiar with. The Developer Site also includes examples and structured learning plans for application and integration developers.</p>

<p>Developer content appears under the new Developer Portal source, so you can filter the search results to see only the content you want. Like much of our content, the Developer Portal is version-specific, and works with the existing version filters. </p>
<p>Developer content is public and does not require you to log in to HI to access it. Just navigate to hi.service-now.com to search for the content you want.</p>
