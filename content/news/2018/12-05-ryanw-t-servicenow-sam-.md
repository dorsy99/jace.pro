<p>We are very humbled by the Innovation of the Year award from the ITAM Review.  At ServiceNow our goal is to make work, work better for people. We work towards our goal by innovating, and we innovate by listening to our customers. Our strong relationships with our customers guide the use cases we solve for.  We deliver SAM differently, on a platform, which opens the door to a zillion use cases not previously possible.  In the words of our founder Fred Luddy, &#34;<em>There is no better experience than giving someone a piece of technology that lets them do something they never thought they could do</em>.&#34;  We are helping imagine what’s possible when you run SAM natively where you manage IT, by solving the use cases of tomorrow for our customers.</p>
<p>Per Martin Thompson, The ITAM Review “<em>The financial risk visibility within the change management process is a game changer. This provides visibility and accountability for stakeholders and is very powerful. It is strategic ITAM, providing useful, actionable information to stakeholders as decisions are being made</em>.”  Customers are now able to automatically see what the software cost impacts are to these scheduled IT changes.

<p><strong><em>Why is it a big deal?</em></strong></p>
<p>Strategic ITAM is about providing useful, actionable information to stakeholders as decisions are being made.  Embedding SAM into everyday IT management, IT operations, IT business management and security are game changers for customers.</p>
<p>ServiceNow customers are making 36,300 change requests every hour. When this is multiplied by hours per day, times days per year, times even a small cost per license, that’s well, a lot of potential software costs being identified. For proactive customers that plan IT changes well in advance to allow for modification before deployment, software planning can be aligned to planned purchases. </p>
<p><strong>Getting our ITAM Customers a seat at the IT decision table</strong></p>
<p>ITAM teams are some of the most underappreciated at organizations.  They are too often under staffed, underfunded and usually on their back foot in a defensive position combating audits and the like.  By being a source of software intelligence for the rest of the business, they finally have a seat at the table.</p>
<p>The better together feature is the first of many that we hope will make our customer’s lives easier.  By surfacing license intelligence around routine IT activity, customers will be able to actually start gaining visibility into non-compliance before it happens. Changes like this will give ITAM managers the ability to have eyes and ears everywhere, to surface key software licensing intelligence to your average IT requestor.  This service addresses the need for easier communication between ITAM teams and IT operations, service and configuration teams.  Customers change IT environments all the time, usually involving quick changes to virtual infrastructure. Stopping to consider software costs is not a current consideration for most organizations.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>When modifications are facilitated with automated approvals and workflows, people are put in a better position to communicate and share information more easily. It “<em>will close a loophole that ITAM managers often struggle with – it may mean we no longer have to attend Change Advisory Boards!</em>” AJ Witt of the ITAM Review continues “<em>This is a key differentiator of ServiceNow’s SAM offering and a clear competitive advantage. No other tool vendor has full control over the data structures for CMDB, Change, and ITAM. This control enables a streamlined and auditable workflow for environment changes and software approvals</em>.”</p>
<p>Recently ServiceNow was awarded <a href="https://www.forbes.com/feature/innovative-companies-service-now/#27d4afdcc603" rel="nofollow">Forbes most innovative company</a>, and we plan to continue to deliver more game changing innovation to our SAM customers.</p>

<p><strong>The winds are shifting</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally compliance is calculated after the fact, sometimes a week or month after the latest deployment data is collected.  This non-real time license position approach has left customers in catch up mode, leading to the persistence of software publisher audits.  For the first time, customers can get ahead of compliance instead of reacting to it. With customers struggling with SAM for 20&#43; years, something needs to change.  We think that a single platform is the answer. </p>
<p>Imagine what’s possible when you run SAM from the same place you manage IT.</p>
