<p>You’ve decided to use a partner to implement ServiceNow, but where do you start? How do you narrow down a list of potential partners that can meet your unique needs?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To help with this, we’ve highlighted three questions to consider when searching for potential certified partners for your ServiceNow implementation:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><strong>1. What is a certified partner?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A certified partner is a vendor that is registered in the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/resource-center/data-sheet/ds-services-partner-program.pdf" rel="nofollow">ServiceNow Services Partner Program</a>.</strong> This registration verifies which partners have the experience and expertise needed to deliver successful ServiceNow implementations based on**:</p>
<ul><li>Product Implementation Expertise (e.g. Performance Analytics, HR Service Delivery, CSM, ITSM, etc.)</li><li>Number of Certified Professionals (by product)</li><li>Customer Satisfaction Rating (scored between 0 – 10 (highest), with 8 as the minimum to register) </li><li>Country and Regional Coverage</li></ul>
<p>Having a certified partner in place will help your implementation go smoothly, and deliver value quickly.</p>
