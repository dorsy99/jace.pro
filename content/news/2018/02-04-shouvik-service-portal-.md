<p>Service Portal provides an intuitive way of browsing and navigating through the catalog items.</p><p>But if you have a big data set of items under one category, the loading time of the page increases as it loads all the items under a category at one go.</p><p></p><p>This issue has been addressed in Kingston Release. Please refer to the <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/service-catalog-rn.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/it-service-management/service-catalog-rn.html">release notes</a> for more details.</p><p></p><p>But for users who are in Jakarta, the blog speaks how we can achieve the similar behavior in Jakarta.</p><p></p><p>1. First lets clone the existing SC Category Page Widget and call the new widget as SC Category Pagination</p><p><img   class="image-3 jive-image" height="186" src="f273604adbd057049c9ffb651f9619dc.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 831px; height: 185.59px;" width="831"/></p><p></p><p>2. Import the attached widget xml</p><p></p><p>3. In SC Category Page editor, use the new widget created</p><p><img   class="jive-image image-4" height="205" src="b3f580cadb5cd3041dcaf3231f9619b8.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 835px; height: 204.575px;" width="835"/></p><p></p><p>This should do the trick and you should be able to use the Catalog Item with pagination.</p><p></p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/W9qdrDaa7Fc" width="440" height="330"/></p><p></p><p></p><p>The widget has been created to have 9 items per page. But there is an instance option which can be used to increase the limit beyond 9 items per page.</p><p>Depending on the use case this can be tweaked to have the desired result.</p><p></p><p><img   class="image-5 jive-image" height="145" src="d050abf1db9c9fc0b322f4621f961945.iix" style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; width: 468px; height: 144.69px;" width="468"/></p><p></p><p>NOTE: The widget has been created on latest patch of Jakarta (JP7). Please tweak the widget based on the patches and versions you want to use.</p><p>Please refer to the API documentation for the availability of the APIs in corresponding version.</p>
