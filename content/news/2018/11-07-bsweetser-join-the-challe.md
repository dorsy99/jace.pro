<p>After the success of the <a href="community?id&#61;community_question&amp;sys_id&#61;80050f2ddbd8dbc01dcaf3231f96192e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">404 Page Challenge</a>, we want to put you to the test again! </p>
<p>Complete the <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/training/article/app_store_learnv2_rest_london_rest_in_integrationhub/app_store_learnv2_rest_london_rest_in_integrationhub_objectives?v&#61;london" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">REST in IntegrationHub training module</a> and then build your own IntegrationHub spoke for a REST API. Build something fun or build something useful. It is up to you! </p>
<p>Then post a picture of the Action Picker with one of your actions selected below with a description of your spoke and a link to your IntegrationHub spoke on Share or GitHub.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the example I created for the Rebrickable API:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 480px;" src="61ddf62adba5a700afc902d5ca961913.iix" /></p>
<p>As I post this example, the Rebrickable Spoke works with four Rebrickable resources through the four actions seen in the screenshot. The spoke also includes a subflow that runs the three list actions to download foundational Lego data and tables to store this information. </p>
<p>I plan to work more on this spoke over time. You can find my latest <a href="https://github.com/bsweets/rebrickable-spoke" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rebrickable Spoke repository</a> on GitHub. Feel free to fork or copy the repo and add it to your instance to check it out. </p>
