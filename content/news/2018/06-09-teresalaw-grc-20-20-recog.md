<p>“Other GRC solution providers do not offer this level of control automation as they do not provide a full IT Service Management Platform, with direct access to the data needed to test, as ServiceNow does.”</p>
<p>This statement by GRC 20/20 sums up the Solution Perspective written on ServiceNow Governance, Risk, and Compliance.  The document titled “ServiceNow Indicator Based Continuous Control Management - Innovation in Automated Control Management” was written to provide context for the GRC 20/20 Innovation Award.</p>
<p>I, for one, am extremely pleased with the recognition of ServiceNow GRC for our innovation in continuous controls monitoring and in the importance of an integrated platform as it is a critical to maintaining a robust risk and compliance posture.  I hear over and over from customers that “managing controls in manual processes is a losing battle” – it is inefficient, error prone, and costly.  A new paradigm is needed. </p>
<p>ServiceNow offers that paradigm shift from siloed, manual, and inefficient processes to an integrated, automated, and effective risk platform. GRC 20/20 explains that “The ServiceNow Indicator-Based Continuous Control Management functionality delivers efficiency, effectiveness, and agility to strengthen risk management, security, and compliance for organizations across industries and around the world. Organizations can implement control indicators that can test data on schedule with minimal human intervention.”</p>
<p><strong>Integrated:</strong></p>
<p>The key to increasing performance and productivity is consistent and cross-functional automation.  As GRC 20/20 highlights, this is only possible with an integrated platform.  ServiceNow was founded as a platform company.  The Now Platform collects data from across the organization through a variety of ServiceNow, third-party, and partner applications. It provides an integrated Configuration Management Database (CMDB) for business context, cross-functional workflows, dashboards, and reporting.  ServiceNow GRC has access to data collected by IT, Customer Service, HR, and Security.  When GRC is used in conjunction with Security Operations Vulnerability Response it can provide business impact for vulnerabilities, and Security Incident Response to ensure incidents are closed based on proper policy (and proof is available if needed during an audit). </p>
<p><strong>Automation:</strong></p>
<p>Through control automation, checks can be performed to ensure vendors have returned their assessments on time, changes have been approved before being applied, and employees have watched their on-boarding videos.  All of this can occur on a scheduled basis – automatically.  Better yet, when there are compliance issues or risks identified, issues are automatically generated to the appropriate individuals and tracked to completion, dynamic dashboards are updated for enterprise-wide visibility, and risks are automatically prioritized based on business impact across the organization and with vendors.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Risk Platform:</strong></p>
<p>GRC 20/20 explains that ServiceNow can “enhance detection and response by providing control evidence on a daily / weekly basis and by launching related remediation plans (Issues) immediately. The organization has an up-to-date view of compliance at any time.”  The risk and compliance posture of your organization is changing rapidly – you can’t afford to rely on point-in-time or random snapshots to identify high-impact or emerging risks.  Without continuous monitoring it is easy to miss risks that could be exploited to become a breach or audit finding.</p>
<p>ServiceNow GRC helps transform inefficient processes across the extended enterprise into a unified risk program. Through continuous monitoring and automation, ServiceNow delivers a real-time view of compliance and risk, improves decision making, and increases performance across the organization and with vendors.  Only ServiceNow can connect the business, security, and IT with an integrated risk framework that transforms manual, siloed, and inefficient processes into a unified risk program built a single platform.</p>
