<p>Customer success, right? Yes, that&#39;s right. Our new leadership  and the entire company under CEO John Donahoe is maniacally focused on Customer Success. </p>
<p>Making sure the Now Platform and ServiceNow solutions (Modernize ITSM, Run IT Like a Business, Eliminate Service Outages, Increase Customer Satisfaction, Consumerize the Employee Service Experience, Resolve Security &amp; Vulnerability Threats Fast, Digitize Your Business with Intelligent Apps) deliver the business outcomes that customers seek.</p>
<p>Helping them develop a roadmap for continued success. Helping them get the most from the Now Platform in terms of return on investment and maximizing the scope of solutions to their business problems (which drive those desired outcomes) that they can realize with the Now Platform.</p>
<p>Turns out that ISV (Technology) Partners fit the customer success bill quite nicely. ISV partners build apps on the Now Platform that increase the solution scope available to customers. These apps drive more of the outcomes customers are looking for, by complementing and extending ServiceNow solutions and products into new high impact use cases, extending feature/function/capabilities of ServiceNow products, solving for critical industry regulatory compliance, and addressing entirely new solution white spaces - all on the Now Platform that every ServiceNow customer has.</p>
<p>ISV Partners are an important part of the Digitize Your Business with Intelligent Apps solution. Here&#39;s how they fit into the big picture:</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To bring these ISV partners and their apps to life in a way that is helpful to customers, we&#39;re introducing the Intelligent Apps World partner blog series. </p>
<p>This partner blog series maps to the seven ServiceNow solutions, and is all about showcasing customer success driven by Intelligent Apps designed, built, certified, and available <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home?cid&#61;11401" rel="nofollow">in the ServiceNow Store</a> to customers globally - so that other ServiceNow customers might learn how they too can utilize ISV partner apps to drive even more of their own success on the Now Platform.</p>
<p> Twice a month starting next Thursday March 15th, our top ISV partners will publish a customer success story via a blog post here in this forum with the goal being to educate and help other customers i) become aware of this world of intelligent apps but most importantly ii) help them understand and engage with the partner on how they can take advantage of these ready to use, certified apps to deploy into production on the Now Platform faster, increase their solution scope, and drive even more valuable outcomes with ServiceNow.</p>
<p>The editorial calendar is below so you can see what&#39;s coming by ServiceNow solution/conversation and tune into what interests you.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Partner blog posts will include an app explainer video and will be followed by an interactive Community Expert Event (no registration required) about 3 weeks later where partners will go deeper into their solutions from a technical/practitioner/implementation/real world tips and tricks perspective, and customers can get their questions answered live from the partner experts. And of course customers can engage immediately with the partners via the blog post discussion thread.</p>
<p> The &#34;original six&#34; partners in the Editorial Calendar above are featured in the attached  Intelligent Apps World: Profiles in Customer Success eBook - through the lense of one of their successful customers story-on-a-page. </p>
