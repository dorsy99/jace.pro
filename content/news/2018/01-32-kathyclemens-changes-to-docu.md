<p>Notice a few changes recently on the product documentation site? On the heels of the <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=966e22eddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961965">defragmentation effort that Katie recently blogged about</a>, we completed a project to rearrange some of the content on our docs site to align better with the way ServiceNow applications and features appear across all sites. We also wanted to group technical information about Now Platform in a more logical way, and unbury some content that just wasn't getting the attention it deserved. Our ultimate goal is that you find the information you want, where you expect it, and have a similar experience navigating all ServiceNow websites.</p><p></p><h1>Changes to search tiles</h1><p>In our ongoing efforts to improve your experience with our docs site, we made these recent changes to our release search pages:</p><ul><li>Software Asset Management is now a new search tile and has its own content area, starting with Jakarta release.</li><li>Now Platform content was divided into three new search tiles and content areas, called Now Platform Capabilities, Now Platform User Interface, and Now Platform Administration, starting with Helsinki content forward.</li><li>The Application Development search tile was renamed to Now Platform Custom Business Applications starting with Helsinki content forward. We also moved all of the Scripting and Web service content information into this content area.</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img   alt="kingston_tiles_changes.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="d99b1942db1c13043eb27a9e0f9619c6.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 479px;"/></p><p>Additionally, we moved a few other applications and features content between existing content areas to align better with how these features are grouped within the ServiceNow portfolio, and to simplify the navigation and search within content areas.</p><p></p><p>We hope you find that these changes make it easier to navigate the documentation website. I encourage you to have a look around at what's changes, and continue to give us your ideas about how we can improve your experience with our documentation.
