<p>As the ServiceNow platform gains popularity as a strategic platform for the world&#39;s largest companies, more and more Independent Software Vendors are looking to ServiceNow as the quickest and most lucrative path to market for their technology. One of the many benefits of deploying a certified solution through our marketplace to our customers is access to our team and all its resources. However, not all partners are able to take advantage of this. To understand what you need to do, as an ISV, to be able to take advantage of all of the Technology Partner Program benefits, consider the following:</p>
<p>As of mid 2018, there were approx. 400 ISV&#39;s in our Technology Partner Program. If you are considering becoming a Technology Partner and listing an application on https://store.servicenow.com or are already a TPP and want to increase your success, consider these points:</p>
<ol><li>Do you ONLY want market visibility of your integration?</li><li>Do you want to incent the ServiceNow sales team, get product guidance, dedicated account management, and a more strategic partnership building a solution together with ServiceNow?</li></ol>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong> is best met by building a <strong>simple integration</strong>, getting it certified, <strong>listing it for free</strong>, and you&#39;re all set - learn how to do so here: <a title="Technology Partner Technical Learning Plan" href="https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/lp/technology_partner_program_1?v&#61;madrid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Technology Partner Technical Learning Plan</a></p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong> is best met by participating in the Technology Partner Program<strong> revenue share program</strong> (ask your Partner Account manager for more details on this) and selling a ServiceNow application on the store that <strong>drives measurable value for our customers</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, our best partners are doing more than just integrating with the ServiceNow platform. They often begin their journey with an integration, getting their data into ServiceNow and then making actionable, qualified, insights/recommendations based on that data. Where things get very compelling is when your ServiceNow application can then DO WORK on behalf of your users with that data. </p>
<p>&#39;Doing Work&#39;, in application speak, often means building business rules, workflows, or other custom scripts/app-components that, for example, assign tasks to employees, provision changes in the customer environment, proactively solve problems, or even coalescing external data sources in a meaningful manner and exposing some sort of contextual awareness to the ServiceNow user. Leverage the ServiceNow platform as the framework for managing complex change, approvals, and interdependent business lines of service...use your application to tell ServiceNow what needs to be done. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Make the ServiceNow platform work better for our customers.</strong></span></p>
<p>This is what our customers are looking for, and this is what moves our ISV&#39;s from a Tier 3 partner to a Tier 1 partner.</p>
<p>This is a journey that we want to embark on together, it will take both of us to get there. If your intention is to be a top ISV partner here&#39;s how we can help you accomplish your goals:</p>
<ul><li>Product Ideation - understanding how to map your technology to the ServiceNow platform</li><li>Use case qualification and art of possible conversations</li><li>ServiceNow Business Unit collaboration and validation </li><li>ServiceNow Product Line Sales collaboration and validation</li><li>Lighthouse customer identification and validation</li><li>Go to Market Strategy</li><li>Go to Market Support</li></ul>
<p>Here&#39;s what this journey can look like:</p>

<p>Looking at the image above, you can see that the ideal end state for the highest level of success (read: generating significant revenue) is a native application built on the ServiceNow Platform (<a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/c23545ae4f954a00b794a88ca310c798/5.1.4?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fq%3Dnuvolo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nuvolo</a> <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/d944db16dbbfa200c0d956f0cf96191c/3.0.600?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fq%3Dmobichord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Mobichord</a> <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/ea6e6f110f663100b8f23b8ce1050ef0/4.10.05?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fq%3Dfairchild" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fairchild</a> <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/c28267b7db98c70046c9f8fdbf961985/1.6.4?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fapptype%3Dnonintegrations%26orderby%3Drating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Wrangu</a> <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/445bb4d60f15b200cfaf059ce1050e1c/2.1.23?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fq%3Dsaleswon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SalesWon</a> just to name a few). However, you can still drive incredible value for the ServiceNow customer with a complex application that still leverages some external functionality (<a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/5950d7444f2231000e9fa88ca310c78c/5.0.1?referer&#61;sn_appstore_store.do%23!/store/search%3Fq%3DxMatters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">xMatters</a> <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/5c6bca120f63720047b38ecce1050e7b/1.0.12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Okta</a>).</p>
<p>The common themes with Tier 1 solutions are:</p>
<ul><li>Significant revenue generated from the application</li><li>Significant value to the ServiceNow customer</li><li>Real business problems solved with the application</li></ul>
<p>Tier 2 and Tier 1 partners benefit various aspects outlined above, to create a plan to move from left to right on the value continuum reach out to your ISV Partner Account Manager or email me at david.gatley&#64;servicenow.com and I&#39;ll help you get in touch with the right person.</p>
