<p>Service-now.com was graciously invited by Mark Storace, IT Service Management Professional Association founder and CEO, to provide the <a title="w.itsmpa.org/itsmpa/ITSMPASpotlightq408.htm" href="http://www.itsmpa.org/itsmpa/ITSMPASpotlightq408.htm" rel="lightframe">vendor spotlight for the ITSMP-a Q408 newsletter</a>. We jumped at the opportunity as we see current market forces colliding in our benefit. The economy and customer abuse by HP and BMC are driving ITSM professionals to find a better software alternative. Of course, Service-now.com can be the answer to many of these troubles.<br /><br />Drawing an analogy to the world of sports, I try to explain why is now time, more than ever, for IT service management professionals to get in shape. Looking forward to your feedback.</p>
