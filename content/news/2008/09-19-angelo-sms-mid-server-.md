<p>Like I suspect many of you do, we use SMS to electronically poll and gather information about our network. The MID Server in Service-now reads the SMS tables (five in all) to populate the CMDB. We want to use the CMDB as our book of record. We have discovered, however, that some items are not being picked up by SMS and have been unable to determine why. Has anyone else experienced this issue?<br />We have the localhost agent configured properly (it pulls in most of what is on our network), but there is no record in the CMBD for any of our network printers, SAN storage and selected desktops. If anyone has any thoughts or insights about this, please post it to this forum.<br />Thanks in advance.</p>
