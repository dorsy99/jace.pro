<p>So if you're into Twitter you will probably find this list of Service-now.com employees who tweet useful. If you have no idea what Twitter is, here is a definition (in 140 characters or less) <a title="itter.com/rglauser" href="http://twitter.com/rglauser" rel="lightframe">Twitter</a> is micro blogging based on the question, "what are you doing?" <br /><br />If you are on Twitter, please let me know so that I can start following you. And feel free to follow me, as long as you don't mind the occasional non Service-now.com-related post about my super-fantastic life. I promise though, most of my tweets are relevant to Service-now.com or industry news.<br /><br />So's here's the list of Twitter folk who hail from Service-now.com:<br /><a title="itter.com/fred_luddy" href="http://twitter.com/fred_luddy" rel="lightframe">Fred Luddy</a><br /><a title="itter.com/dgreenbaum" href="http://twitter.com/dgreenbaum" rel="lightframe">Dan Greenbaum</a><br /><a title="itter.com/rwoodbyrne" href="http://twitter.com/rwoodbyrne" rel="lightframe">Rob Woodbyrne</a><br /><a title="itter.com/robmphillips" href="http://twitter.com/robmphillips" rel="lightframe">Rob Phillips</a><br /><a title="itter.com/matthewfrench9" href="http://twitter.com/matthewfrench9" rel="lightframe">Matt French</a><br /><a title="itter.com/bsurritt" href="http://twitter.com/bsurritt" rel="lightframe">Brian Surritt</a><br /><a title="itter.com/rtiller" href="http://twitter.com/rtiller" rel="lightframe">Ruann Tiller</a><br /><a title="itter.com/j_roberts" href="http://twitter.com/j_roberts" rel="lightframe">John Roberts</a><br /><a title="itter.com/jpwatts38" href="http://twitter.com/jpwatts38" rel="lightframe">James Watts</a><br /><a title="itter.com/tbrown16" href="http://twitter.com/tbrown16" rel="lightframe">Terry Brown</a><br /><a title="itter.com/jskelley714" href="http://twitter.com/jskelley714" rel="lightframe">John Kelley</a><br /><a title="itter.com/rglauser" href="http://twitter.com/rglauser" rel="lightframe">Rhett Glauser</a><br /><a title="itter.com/jeremiahrhall" href="http://twitter.com/jeremiahrhall" rel="lightframe">Jeremiah Hall</a><br /><a title="itter.com/8sigmas" href="http://twitter.com/8sigmas" rel="lightframe">Tom Dilatush</a><br /><br />Are you wondering what the deal is with Twitter names servicenow or servicenowcom and their serious inactivity? I've reserved those Twitter "domian names" to keep them from getting brand jacked or twitter squatted by cyber undesirables. Maybe we'll activate them for something in the future, like maybe Knowledge '09 show coverage and updates.<br /><br />Let's build the Service-now.com Twitter community.</p>
