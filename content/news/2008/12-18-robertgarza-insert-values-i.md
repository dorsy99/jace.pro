<p>I would like to insert the priority and category and possibly other values in a new incident ticket(form) based off conditions in an assignment rule after an email is received by the instance. <br /><br />In this case the Anti-virus server would send an email to our instance, then the assignment rule would prioritize and categorize the incident based on the subject line of the email.<br /><br />Is this possible in the script box of the assignment rule and does anyone have an examples of these kinds of conditions and inserts. Or does this need to be done in an inbound action record?<br /><br />-Robert</p>
