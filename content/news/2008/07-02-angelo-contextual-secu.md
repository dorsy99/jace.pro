<p>We here at ICW have turned on Contextual Security in two of our instances. In our development environment, we've experienced a few issues (nothing major), but I suspect that is because we didn't fully understand how Contextual Security worked when we got into it. In our staging instance, we'd not had any problems at all. I'm seriously thinking about turning this on in our prod instance, but wanted to ask the group if they've a) turned this feature on; and b) had any issues with it.</p>
