<p>First off, apologies for the delays in getting out the info for our first meeting. After a few discussions with SNC and some of the larger groups planning on attending for our user group, we decided it would be best to push the first meeting until after the holidays. <br /><br />Once that was pinned down, we set on a suitable location. A big thanks goes out to Dave at Navigator Management Partners for offering their conference space for the meeting. <br /><br />That said, here are the details:<br /><br />Date: Jan 22, 2009<br />Location:<br />Navigator Management Partners<br />450 S Front Street<br />Columbus, OH 43215 <br />Phone: 614.796.0090<br />http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=450+s+front+st++columbus,+ohio&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=50.910968,79.101563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=39.953175,-83.001366&amp;spn=0.048557,0.077248&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=r2<br /><br />Tentative Agenda:<br /><br />3:00-3:15 Introductions and User Group goals <br /> <br />3:15â€”3:45 Overview of Service-now usage, Presented by: OhioHealth <br /> <br />3:45-4:00 Break <br /> <br />4:00-4:45 Service-now Technical Topic Presented by Service-now.com: 2009 Winter Release Overview <br /> <br />4:45-5:15 Open Question/Answer <br /> <br />5:15-5:30 Discuss next meeting<br /><br />5:30 Optional Happy Hour next door<br /><br />Please post up any questions or comments.
