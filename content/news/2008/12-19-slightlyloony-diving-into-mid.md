You get to choose this in the sense that you can control which schedule contains the range of IPs any given CI is in, and the schedule determines which MID server is used. But what if you just want to see which MID server discovered a CI, or which CIs a particular MID server is discovering?<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="ffe3858adb5897041dcaf3231f9619de.iix" style="width: auto; height: 71px;" />That's what the MID/CI Relations table is for (navigate to <b>Discovery â†’ MID/CI Relations</b>), and a typical example is visible in the screenshot at left. This table is very straightforward. The CI column shows all the CIs that have been discovered, and clicking on an entry takes you directly to that CI's form. THe MID Server column shows you which MID server most recently discovered this CI, and clicking on an entry takes you directly to that MID server's form. Finally, the IP Address column shows you the IP address used to discover that CI.</p>
