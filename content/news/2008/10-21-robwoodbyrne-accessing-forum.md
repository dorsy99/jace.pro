<p>Hi everybody,<br /><br />For those of you who are having trouble accessing areas of the forum, please go to 'My account' and apply for appropriate roles. You can login with your credentials from the old forum.<br /><br />You will have the choice of [no-glossary]'customer,'[/no-glossary] 'partner,' 'blogger' and 'employee'... Should be fairly self explanitory and the blogger role is pretty much open to anybody who wants to blog about Service-now, SaaS, ITIL or ITSM, so if you are interested in doing so, just apply. :)</p>
