It's a place where Discovery remembers some things about past discoveries, both for its own use in future discoveries and for use by administrators. The image at right shows the beginning of the IP Addresses table on a Service-now instance that runs discoveries at our Solana Beach headquarters (aka the "Wooden Spaceship"). <!--break--> <br /><br />You should not modify the contents of this table — but there's lots of useful stuff in here for you to look at and use yourself. <br /><br />Each record in this table was created by a discovery — exactly <i>which</i> Discovery component found the IP address and <i>when</i> it did so can be seen in the two right-hand columns. But it's the three columns on the left: IP Address, Configuration Item (CI), and Host name that will probably be most useful to you. The "Go to" box on this table works just like it does everywhere else in Service-now: you can choose any of those columns, type in a value, hit enter (or click on the magnifying glass icon) and <i>voila!</i> — you'll see the item you chose. <br /><br />The very convenient thing about this table is that it contains every IP address, every CI, and every host name that Discovery has ever found, all in one spot. Once you've located the entry you're after, you can simply click on the CI's name (in the "Configuration Item" column, and you'll be taken to the CI's form. Handy!</p>
