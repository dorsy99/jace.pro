<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="4f860882dbdc5704ed6af3231f961933.iix" style="width: auto; height: 108px;" />I've written about <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2008/11/1/1912" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=0b6d2e29dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619d7">serial numbers</a> before, and even mentioned the invalid serial number table (<b>Discovery Definition â†’ Invalid Serial Numbers</b>). Like the soldiers at right take care of the bad guys to keep us safe, the invalid serial number table takes care of the bad serial numbers in your environment to keep your CMDB clean. Here I'll show you how to add your own entries to this table, to handle the bad serial numbers you find.<!--break--><br /><br /><img __jive_id="6529" alt="" class="jive-image" src="imagecache/Small/SlightlyLoony/screenshots/Picture%206.png" style="width: auto; height: 108px;" />At left is a view of the out-of-the-box invalid serial number table. Looking at the serial number table (<b>Discovery â†’ Serial Numbers</b>) for the Wooden Spaceship here, I see that we have a serial number "Not Available" showing up as a valid serial number — and clearly, it is <i>not</i> valid. I'll use this as a real-world example of how to make a new entry in the invalid serial numbers to take care of this.<br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="fc5467b5db941704ed6af3231f9619f4.iix" style="width: auto; height: 54px;" />The first step is to click <i>New</i> on the invalid serial number table to add a new entry. The screenshot at right shows how I filled the form in to take care of "Not Available", but here are the details on each field:<ul><li><b>Type</b>: This field controls what kind of comparison is done against the serial field. I chose <i>Is</i> because I want to eliminate serial numbers that exactly match "Not Available". There are two other choices: <i>Contains</i>, which will match the serial field if it appears anywhere in a serial number, and <i>Matches Regular Expression</i>, which is a powerful matching tool if you happen to know <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expresssions</a>.</li><li><b>Serial</b>: This field is what you're testing against serial numbers Discovery reads from your equipment. Discovery does two things before it does the actual comparison. First it removes any ignore characters (see the <i>Ignore</i> field below) from both the <i>Serial</i> field and the serial number being tested. In our case, that means the <i>Serial</i> field becomes "notavailable" before comparison, because a space is one of the ignore characters. Second, if the <i>Case sensitive</i> field is not checked, it converts both the <i>Serial</i> field and the serial number being tested to all lower-case characters. After these two steps, Discovery does the comparison you specified in the <i>Type</i> field.</li><li><b>Case sensitive</b>: If checked, then comparisons will only match if the <i>case</i> of the characters matches — "A" matches "A", but not "a". If unchecked, then the case of a character doesn't matter. More <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitive" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitive">here</a>.</li><li><b>Ignore</b>: This field specifies a list of characters that will be ignored in any comparison. See the <i>Serial</i> field for details on how this works.</li></ul></p>
