<p>Recently I've been just one of a few who are working on our upcoming Global Text Search capability. Long asked for, frequently wished for, occasionally demanded (with unsurprisingly equal results), it is now coming. Like a freight train, from my perspective, since we're aiming for the next release.<br /><br />The next release, by the way, is dubbed the Winter 2009 release. Sound like it's a year away? Nah. This Winter only resides about 11.11111111111111% in 2008, and we're not gonna release in those 10 days. Very shortly thereafter, however, hence the "Winter 2009" release...<br /><br />Hmm. That's pretty hemispherocentric. Maybe our Australian customers (HOLLA!!) might prefer this one to be called the Summer 2009 release. Maybe we should use Stardates. The next release will (maybe) be on Stardate -313975.79908<br /><br />Anyway, Global Text Search. Daunting! Stay tuned.<br /><br />--J</p>
