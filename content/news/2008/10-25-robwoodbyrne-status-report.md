<p>Hi everybody,<br /><br />First of all, thanks for all the great feedback on the new 'forums', which you are becoming aware of, is far more than just forums!<br /><br />It has been a long road getting to this point, and there are many requests for improvements that I am working with the team here to fix up and improve. An example which quickly come to mind is allowing some sort of WYSIWYG editor (rich-text editor) on some of the fields where it would be nice to have more control over layout, without using straight HTML. We have to be careful wit this, because these editors tend to break other things, for instance the video player and the asset upload widget, plus it makes it difficult to use the very, very cool 'Flickr' markup that is now available! You can use the syntax: [ flickr - photo:id=230452326,size=s] or [ flickr - photoset:id=72157594262419167,size=m] (remove the spaces) to directly insert inline Flickr images into your posts! Pretty cool, huh?<br /><br />We just finished up our Quarterly Business Review, where I showed off the new 'CMS' to upper management, and things went well, but there is more work to do. Currently we have our Professional Services and Solution Consulting teams in Solana Beach training up on new functionality and showing off some of the cool things we have been doing for our customers out in the field. It is truly amazing at the things that you are developing on our platform!<br /><br />I will try to get some pictures up soon, unfortunately the ones I took yesterday were all grainy because I did not use the flash. :( I'll see if I can get a few today.</p>
