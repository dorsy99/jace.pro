Quite a few of you have asked if it might be possible for us to support NetWare â€” even if all we did was to detect that it existed. Well, you've got your wish: Discovery now (starting with the Winter 2009 release) supports NetWare, pretty much just like any other server.<!--break--><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="d8e0e08edb5057049c9ffb651f96194b.iix" style="width: auto; height: 69px;" />Because we don't have any NetWare here are the Wooden Spaceship (nor do I have any at home), I can't make any pretty screenshots for you to rest your gaze upon; you'll have to make do with my description. Fortunately, that's very sweet and simple: a NetWare server shows up much like any other server. You get all the basic information you expect (version, memory, disks, network interfaces, etc.), and NLMs show up as running processes. <br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="8ea300c2db1cd3049c9ffb651f961981.iix" style="width: auto; height: 113px;" />Discovery finds and explores NetWare servers with SNMP. The only prerequisites for Discovery to find your NetWare servers are that they have SNMP enabled (and so far, all the NetWare servers we've run into already have it running), the servers must be included in some Discovery schedule's IP range, and you must configure Discovery with the SNMP community string those NetWare servers are using. That's it!</p>
