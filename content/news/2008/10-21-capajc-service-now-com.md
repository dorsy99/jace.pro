<p>Just logged in to the new Forum at the new community site, and I'm impressed. Nice look, better than the typical forum-looking thing from before. With the old forum, I had to fight past my general dislike of most forum sites' look and feel to get to the content that just kept getting better and better. (My best moment? The first time a customer answered another customer's question. I think I may actually have high-fived myself when I saw that.)<br /><br />If I could have done everything through email with the old forum, I would have. But it's email integration wasn't nearly as good as the Service-now.com app. I rarely have a need to actually log in to our /hi instance, its email integration is so good for my purposes. I'll have to see whether this new forum's email integration is as good.<br /><br />Anyway, welcome to the new community. Same good folks as the old community, but SHINY!<br /><br />--J</p>
