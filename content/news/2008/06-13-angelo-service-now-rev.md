<p>Hello, and welcome everyone to the Southern California Local Users' Group Forum. I'm really excited by having this forum, and hope that it will come to be viewed as invaluable by the team.<br /><br />I'd like to kick this off by asking the group the following question:<br /><br />What current revision of Service-now are you using? Has upgrading (or not upgrading) been a problem? Has anyone had to roll back a revision because of incompatabilities?<br /><br />Here at ICW, we ran into an issue with a revision that caused us no little grief. It made us so gun-shy about future revisions, we have instituted the policy of upgrading our dev instance first, testing it thoroughly, and then (and only then) upgrading prod.<br /><br />I'd be very interested to hear other people's experiences.<br /><br />Angelo</p>
