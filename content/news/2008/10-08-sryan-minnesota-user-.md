<p>It sure was great to have so many Service-now.com fans in one room at our innagural Local User Group meeting. I wish I'd had more time to meet and talk with each of you about your experiences! Next time we need to build more time into the schedule for open Q and A and networking - or maybe go for happy hour after our meeting!<br /><br />If any of you would like to chat about what we are doing with Service-now.com at BCBSMN, I'm happy to share. You can contact me as follows:<br /><br />susan_ryan@bluecrossmn.com<br />651-662-3582</p>
