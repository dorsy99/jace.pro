<p>This is my first attempt at videos. The only thing I have done is checked with a few of my Service Desk techs to see if it made their ears bleed listening to me. I am still working on fixing the audio level but no blood was noticed.<br /><br />I did have to add the related list Delegate-&gt;User so that the technician can see who they have assigned as their own delegates. The Delegate-&gt;Delegate list (shown out of box) shows who has you as a delegate to work their issue while out.<br /><br />For anyone wondering, I am using Camtasia Studio 5 and it is very user friendly for novices.</p>
