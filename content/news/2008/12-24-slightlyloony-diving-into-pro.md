Though this happened a couple years ago, there's still considerable debate about how to classify <a>Pluto</a>. But unless you're a scientist working in astronomy, you don't have any say about it.<br /><br />Discovery lets you completely control how processes get classified. This may not have the romance of classifying a rock twirling around our local star, but at least it's something you can control!<!--break--><br /><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="5d8ae88edb909344e9737a9e0f96197b.iix" style="width: auto; height: 81px;" />On this subject, a few days ago a customer asked me a very good question: what values are available in the <i>Name</i> field of a process classification criteria, and what exactly do those values contain? You can see what she was talking about in the screenshot at right, which shows a process classifier that I chose from the list I saw when I navigated to <b>Discovery Definition â†’ Process</b>. The field in question is highlighted in orange.<br /><br />The answer to her question is that it depends — the values are different for each operating system, with minor variations between versions of operating systems. Here's a table with all the details:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><b>Field Value</b></td><td><b>OS</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr><tr><td>pid</td><td>All</td><td>The process ID</td></tr><tr><td>name</td><td>Windows</td><td>The image name of the process (like "crsst.exe")</td></tr><tr><td>output</td><td>Windows</td><td>The entire command line used to start the process</td></tr><tr><td>output</td><td>Linux, Solaris, AIX</td><td>The entire result of the <i>ps</i> command (or the equivalent) for the process</td></tr><tr><td>parameters</td><td>Windows</td><td>The entire command line used to start the process</td></tr><tr><td>command</td><td>All</td><td>The fully qualified path to the process' executable (like "D:\Program Files\Rocks\MyRock.exe")</td></tr><tr><td>user</td><td>Linux, OS/X</td><td>The user that started the process (note that the name may be truncated)</td></tr><tr><td>name</td><td>Netware</td><td>The NLM name</td></tr></table><br />For some operating systems there are actually a few more values, but these are particularly useful for process classification. For example, under OS/X you can also use "vsz", which is the size (in kilobytes) of the process' virtual memory size.<br /><br />By far the most useful values for process classification are "name" and "command". The latter is especially useful when you need to distinguish between multiple instances of a particualr executable running on the same box. In such a case, you can look for a value in the parameters, which certainly will be different for the different instances...</p>
