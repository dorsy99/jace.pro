<p>I'm curious how many customers are at a stage with their implementation where they are able to create dashboards that summarize the health of their business services and infrastructure. Essentially their IT environment. A nirvana state would be when IT Execs and Sr. Managers can log into Service-now and get a picture of what is up/down, availability metrics, SLA information, and other summary level information.<br /><br />Does anyone have this level of reporting in place? If so, would you be willing to share how far you were able to extend Service-now to meet these requirements?<br /><br />Thanks!!</p>
