<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="0b421042db1817049c9ffb651f9619f0.iix" style="width: auto; height: 100px;" />In an <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2010/7/19/2013" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=a56ceaa1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619fc">earlier post</a>, I touched a bit on the <i>arguments</i> property that's available in any function. There I showed how you can use it to create functions that take a variable number of arguments. Today I'm going to dive into a bit more detail on that <i>arguments</i> property, including one little bit that just might qualify as the most obscure part of JavaScript: the <i>callee</i> property.<br /><br />The two female cardinals at right got into a squabble over this, but we don't need to...<br /><!--break--><br />Here's a bit of code that illustrates all the things I want to talk about:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />function factorial(x) {<br />   return x ? x * factorial(x - 1) : 1;<br />}<br /><br />var f = function(x) {<br />   return x ? x * arguments.callee(x - 1) : 1;<br />};<br /><br />var g = function() {<br />   return arguments[0] ? arguments[0] * arguments.callee(arguments[0] - 1) : 1;<br />};<br /><br />function identity(x) {<br />   gs.log('Identical? ' + ((x === arguments[0]) ? 'yes' : 'no'));<br />}<br /><br />gs.log(factorial(8));<br />gs.log(f(8));<br />gs.log(g(8));<br />identity('bogus');<br /></pre><br />And when I run the code, I get this log:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />40320<br />40320<br />40320<br />Identical? yes</pre><br />The <i>factorial</i> function uses recursion to compute the <a title=".wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a> of the given number. This function is defined in the usual manner. <br /><br />The next example is the same recursive factorial function, but it is defined anonymously and assigned to the variable <i>f</i>. That leads to a problem: how can the anonymous function (which of course has no name) call itself recursively? The <i>callee</i> property (of the <i>arguments</i> property) solves this menace to our programming freedom. It is always set to the function itself — exactly what you need to make a recursive call. So far as I'm aware, that's the only use of the <i>callee</i> property.<br /><br />Right after that, we do almost exactly the same thing: define the same recursive factorial function, anonymously. But this time we didn't even name an argument — instead, we took the argument from the <i>arguments</i> property, by specifying the first argument (<i>arguments[0]</i>). Otherwise it works exactly the same way.<br /><br />The last part of the example is the <i>identity</i> function. Here we're just illustrating a special feature of the <i>arguments</i> property. It works basically like an array, but there are some differences. One of those differences is that the numbered properties of the <i>arguments</i> property are synonyms for the named arguments to the function. In the <i>identity</i> function we compare the named argument <i>x</i> to the <i>arguments[0]</i> property using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators"><i>strict equals</i></a> operator — and we find that they are exactly the same value, confirming that the named argument and the numbered element of the <i>arguments</i> property are just two different ways to refer to exactly the same value.<br /><br />Right about now you might be asking yourself what you're going to do with this useless dreck I've just filled your mind with. Well, you can impress your geekly friends with your knowledge of obscure JavaScript trivia. Or you could confuse your enemies by creating all your JavaScript functions without any named arguments at all. Oh, and there's always the remote possibility that you might actually need to create a recursive anonymous function with a variable number of arguments. You might, you never know...</p>
