<p>By Way of Brian Newcomb I wanted to pass along some updates that may be of interest to our Ohio User Group. <br /><br /><br /><br />[quote]<br />Hello Central Ohio,<br /><br />We have been working to schedule a number of meetings and events over the next 6 months in the Central Ohio LIG. If you haven't been to the site lately, now is a great time to do so. We have a great list of topics to be presented by some of the best resources in the area. You can get more information and register for any of these FREE events at http://co.itsmfusa.org including:<br /><br />July 21, Customer Service Metrics<br /><br />October 21, Problem Management<br /><br />November 17, Supplier and Strategic Sourcing<br /><br /> <br /><br />We are also planning to bring the ABC's of ICT workshop to Columbus in August. Watch the website and your inbox for more information on this unique opportunity! Thanks to Maryville Technologies, we will be able to provide this at no charge to you!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Please pass this information around, share it with your colleagues, and come join us! Our programs and presenters are great leaders and facilitators, but the real value comes when diverse input and experience is shared among the group.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing you soon,<br /><br /> <br /><br />Brian Newcomb<br /><br />President, Central Ohio LIG<br /><br />itSMF USA<br /><br />[/quote]</p>
