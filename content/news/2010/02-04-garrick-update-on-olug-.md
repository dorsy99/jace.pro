<p>First off, don't worry, you didn't volunteer for anything. Our registration emails have evidently been thanking many of your for volunteering and providing a goofy link. While I do thank all of you for your participation and support and look forward to seeing everyone Friday the 5th, no need for volunteers. <br /><br />I'm currently investigating our confirmation emails and the link/wording they are sending out. I'll post an update when I get more details on the situation.<br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Garrick</p>
