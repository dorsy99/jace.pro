<p>Hi all,<br /><br />We've made some slight tweaks to the Skills Management doc:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Skills_Management_Plugin<br /><br />Basically, Skills Management was originally created for use within Field Services management, so that you can assign only skilled users to a task in the field. In Stable 2, this was added to Project Tasks (http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Project_Management_v2_Plugin#Fall_2010_Stable_2 ).<br /><br />However, Skills Management can be used on any task table.<br /><br />For instance: Suppose an Incident is opened that can only be handled by someone who has done DBA on a Linux Server. The 1st Level Help Desk technician can add the skill "Linux Server" to the form, and then when they reassign the Incident, only users with Linux Server experience will be selectable.<br /><br />Once defined, Skills can be associated with any user like roles. The article above details how to set it up and how to use it.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Documentation<br /><br />P.S. One of the things we're keeping our eyes open for are things that currently documented for one part of the product, but could be re-used in other places, so that you can better understand how to leverage our tools across different applications. If you spot similar tools that could be documented more broadly, let us know.</p>
