<p>Hi all,<br /><br />One of our developers, John Roberts, is helping the documentation team out by helping us document some of the APIs that are missing. Today's installment are two new Utility classes.<br /><br />Here's a short API with a couple methods used for dealing with CIs:<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=CIUtils<br /><br />And here's a slightly longer API of the script include that contains some methods for dealing with Javascript Arrays:<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=ArrayUtil<br /><br />As with all of our released APIs, it is now added to our PDF Book of APIs:<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Book:Glide_Reference<br /><br />Feedback, as always, is welcome.<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />SNC Documentation</p>
