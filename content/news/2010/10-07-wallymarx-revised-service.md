<p>Hello--<br /><br />As some of you know, we have been working on a revision to our wiki functionality. The primary purpose of this update is to make it easier to find content and get answers. I'm happy to say it's almost ready to go. Our plan is to go live this Friday, October 8. <br /><br />New features include:<br /><br />* Google custom search across wiki, community forums and blogs <br />* User feedback <br />* Reader discussion <br />* Recaptcha authentication for discussions <br />* Tree menus <br />* Category breadcrumb navigation<br />* Feedback tools <br />* Articles categorization<br />* New TOC and site map <br />* Cleaner look and feel <br /><br />We will let you know when it is up. We look forward to your feedback.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Wally Marx<br />Mgr. Tech Pubs<br />wally.marx@service-now.com</p>
