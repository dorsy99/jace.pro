<p>Neither rain, nor sleet, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds...<br /><br /> So there have been a few questions about tomorrow's weather advisory and the plan is to continue as planned. We hope to see everyone there, but if the weather looks concerning, especially from you from way out of town, we understand and will post some updates from the meet up tomorrow. <br /><br /> Again, while we look forward to seeing everyone, please be safe tomorrow and feel free to contact me or Terry Brown with Service-now.com for any last minute details, updates, or weather conditions.</p>
