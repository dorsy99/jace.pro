<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />Documentation is now available for the Tiny URL Support Plugin, newly released with Spring 2010 Stable 2:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Tiny_URL_Support_Plugin<br /><br />The Tiny URL Support Plugin is built to deal with issues in Internet Explorer, where very large URLs lead to "Failure to open page" errors. Tiny URL Support uses an in-built URL shortener to circumvent these issues.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />SNC Documentation</p>
