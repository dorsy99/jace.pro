<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />For those administrators whose instances are in the London datacenter, the SSL certificate expires on July 11, 2010. Information on the change is available here:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=London_Certificate_Change<br /><br />This probably does not apply to most readers, but if it does apply to your instance make sure to review that information.<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Service-now Documentation</p>
