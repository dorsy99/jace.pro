<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="fe45e102db5cd304b322f4621f9619a4.iix" style="width: auto; height: 188px;" />Yesterday I showed you how to add a method to the <i>Dog class</i> (see navigator links below the fold). Today I'm going to add a second method, but more importantly, I'm going to show you how to define class methods in a slightly more convenient way, using a feature of JavaScript called an <i>object literal</i>, also called <a title="w.json.org/" href="http://www.json.org/">JavaScript Object Notation</a> (or JSON for short, pronounced JAY-sahn).<br /><br />Just to be clear, before I introduce the JSON way, you <i>could</i> add the new class method using the same way I showed you yesterday. The JSON way is just a bit easier, with a little less cluttered code. When you start delving into the OO JavaScript that comes with our product, you'll see that we've used the JSON approach almost exclusively, just by convention.<br /><br />So what is this JSON stuff? Glad you asked:<br /><!--break--><br /><div style="background:white;padding:4px;border:1px solid black;font-size:80%;width:200px;clear: right; float:right;"><b>Object-Oriented JavaScript:</b><br /><a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2010/8/25/2036" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=228c2ae1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96197e">First Steps...</a><br /><a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2010/8/26/2037" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=a6ecae65dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96196a">A Methodical Step...</a><br /></div><br />Here's my rewritten <i>Dog class</i> (with the script extracted from the Dog Script Include):<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />function Dog(name, born) {<br />   this.call_name = name;<br />   this.birth_date = born;<br />}<br /><br />Dog.prototype = {<br />   age: function() {<br />      var dog_age_ms = new Date().getTime() - this.birth_date.getTime();<br />      var dog_age_days = dog_age_ms / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);<br />      var dog_age_years = Math.floor(dog_age_days / 365.25);<br />      return dog_age_years;<br />   },<br /><br />   birthday: function() {<br />      var months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',<br />                    'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'];<br />      var month = this.birth_date.getMonth();<br />      var day = this.birth_date.getDate();<br />      return months[month] + ' ' + day;<br />   }<br />}<br /></pre><br />First, note how a large block of code enclosed in curly braces ({}), defining two methods (<i>age</i> and <i>birthday</i>), is assigned to the <i>Dog.prototype</i> property. Those curly braces and what they enclose are an example of a JSON <i>object literal</i>. The syntax is very, very close to the code I showed you yesterday â€” but note the differences. First, in the object literal I'm not assigning a function to the <i>age</i> property, as I did yesterday. Instead, the JSON simply declares the <i>age</i> property, then there's a colon, and then the <i>value</i> of that property (in this case the function). After the last closing curly brace of the function definition, there's a comma (,). That's how you separate property definitions in JSON. Next the <i>birthday</i> method is defined, the same way that <i>age</i> method was defined. You can continue this same pattern to define any number of methods for a class you're building.<br /><br />Now let's take a look at some test script and the results:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />var dog = new Dog('Miki', new Date(2006,1,11));<br />gs.log('Hey ' + dog.call_name + '!  You\'re ' + dog.age() + ' years old today!');<br />gs.log(dog.call_name + '\'s birthday is ' + dog.birthday());</pre><br />And when I run that script, I get this:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />Hey Miki!  You're 4 years old today!<br />Miki's birthday is February 11<br /></pre></p>
