<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />The Workflow documentation has been rewritten for usability and clarity. The new topic is available on the wiki starting from here:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Workflow_Overview<br /><br />The PDF book is available here:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Book:Workflow<br /><br />Feedback is always welcome -- you can leave it here, or you can leave it on the pages themselves using our Ratings block and the Discussion page!<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Documentation</p>
