<p>As many of you have voiced--politely, of course-- the Service-now.com community site is in need of a refresh. With our growing customer community and our ever-expanding product, more people are looking for more information about more topics more often. The goal of our refresh is to move toward an environment where it's easy to find answers quickly and where users of Service-now, from new to expert, can share and learn. <br /><br />We are planning on staying with the Drupal platform. A lot of top media, business, and community sites have been made with Drupal. We like that it's open-source and community-supported. We've looked at the alternatives and come out feeling confident we can take this software and run with it.<br /><br />To make this project successful, we need to hear from you. Tell us what you like in a user community and what bugs you when you're trying to find information. Give us suggestions for re-categorizing our forums and how we could make it easier for you to find what you need. Anything you feel would help your experience, let us know.<br /><br />After some response, we'll post a poll or two and distill our data into clear directives. Until then, thanks for your contribution.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Wally Marx<br />Mgr, Tech Pubs<br />wally.marx@service-now.com<br />(858) 436-7424</p>
