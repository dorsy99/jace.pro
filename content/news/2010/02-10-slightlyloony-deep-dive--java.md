<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="3f5a6335dbd09b048c8ef4621f961990.iix" style="width: auto; height: 191px;" />Here's a simple and very useful feature of JavaScript that you may not be aware of: functions may be nested, one inside another. Here's a simple example, in a script you can run on your instance:<br /><pre>&lt;div&gt;<br />gs.log('Hex value of 11259375 is: ' + hex(11259375));<br /><br />function hex(value) {<br />    var rem = value;<br />    var result = '';<br />    while (rem &gt; 0) {<br />        var r = rem % 16;<br />        rem = Math.floor(rem/16);<br />        result = hexChar(r) + result;<br />    }<br />    return result;<br />   <br />    function hexChar(charValue) {<br />        return '0123456789ABCDEF'.charAt(charValue &amp; 0xFF);<br />    }<br />}&lt;/div&gt;</pre><br /><!--break--><br />Note that the function hexChar is entirely within the function hex. <br /><br />You might say: "Ok, but why on earth would I ever want to do this?" Fair question. There are at least two good reasons that I can think of: (1) you have some code that will be used repeatedly in the outer function, and which isn't useful outside that function, and (2) you can break up a large function into smaller, easier to understand (and maintain) pieces.</p>
