<p>Hi everybody,<br /><br />Time is a big and complicated topic. It's not uncommon to be looking for some functionality relating to time, like timing a task or scheduling an action, and having no idea what tool is the tool you're looking for.<br /><br />We've now created a new topic on the wiki to group all of those time topics together:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Time-Related_Functionality<br /><br />It covers:<br />*Date and Time Fields<br />*Time Zones<br />*Defining Schedules<br />*Displaying Time (reports, schedule pages, timelines)<br />*Viewing Logs<br />*Timing<br /><br />You can nab it as a PDF here:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Book:Time<br /><br />I'm sure there's plenty of space for more information, so be sure to leave feedback either here, or using the "Discussion" tabs (you have to be logged in!)<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />SNC Documentation</p>
