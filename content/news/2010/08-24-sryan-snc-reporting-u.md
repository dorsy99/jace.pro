<p>Downloaded the "Pre-Made Book" called Reporting Data off the Wiki. Great content! Perfect way to equip those curious with how to work with Reports in SNC. Also found a few plugins that we don't have turned on that will take reporting from good to FANTASTIC! Didn't know I could download data from other sources to create a custom report - have been telling everyone it's not possible, which it's not without the Custom Charts plugin. Minnesota Local User Group has been asking for assistance with reporting - and the instructions have been right under our noses all this time. Thanks, SNC!!!</p>
