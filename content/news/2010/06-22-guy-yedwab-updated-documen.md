<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />In conjunction with Mark O'Donnell, our Content Management guru, we've rewritten the Content Management documentation to make the plugin easier to use. Particularly, we focused on writing the documentation from a top-down approach, so that you can see how to design the page, not just how to make the different parts.<br /><br />Here are the pages:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Content_Management_Overview<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Getting_Started_With_Content_Management<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Site_Building<br /><br />The newly reworked Content Management pages have been assembled into a wikibook:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Book:Content_Management<br /><br />Feedback is, as always, very helpful.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Documentation</p>
