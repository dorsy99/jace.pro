<p>Hi all,<br /><br />The Fall 2010 Stable 2 release included a Change Collision Detector Plugin. To extend that documentation, we've added an API document for the three Script Includes provided with the plugin. If you're using the plugin, and you're thinking of customizing the business rules or functionality, this API lists and describes the methods specific to the plugin that are available to you:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Change_Collision_API<br /><br />Let us know how it works out for you,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Documentation</p>
