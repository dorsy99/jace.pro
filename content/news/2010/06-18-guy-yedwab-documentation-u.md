<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />I've started this blog to help keep everyone informed about new articles and topics in documentation, so that you'll know when more information is available for topics. I may also use this blog to gather information from you readers to help improve my documentation and set priorities accordingly.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Service-Now Documentation</p>
