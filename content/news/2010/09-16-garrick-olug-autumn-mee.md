We've now settled on a format to hold OLUG meetings once a quarter, taking a break for the annual Service-Now.com Knowledge Conference.&nbsp; We'll be looking to hold the next meeting after the holidays and a bit into the New Year, location to be determined (but it will be again in the Central Ohio area).&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Please look to the community site for an announcement on that once we get some more details pinned down. <br /> <br /> Service-Now provided<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>an update on their fiscal year end and some new upcoming features in the next release. Tony Moldovan from <a title="ww.wheatland.com/index.htm" href="https://www.wheatland.com/index.htm">the John Maneely Company</a> shared their work on time and resource tracking.&nbsp; <span class="Apple-converted-space">A few people have requested a copy of Tony's presentation. If it becomes available, I'll attach a copy to this post. &nbsp;</span><br /> <p><span class="style1">Maryville was kind enough to sponsor lunch and give an overview of their experience working with Service-Now, their expertise in the industry, and insight into the changes they've seen by working with a broad range of clients and engagements. I provided an overview of how we're using project management to manage and triage our business unit projects at OhioHealth and was followed by Barry Brooks of Service-Now who was able to show off some of the new capabilities of Project Management and what's coming down the pike in this area. It was best summed by the line "we listened to what Project Managers wanted in an application and built that."</span></p><br /> <p><span class="style1">Barry</span> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-converted-space">also previewed IT Cost Management and the flexibility and capability here. We wrapped the afternoon with open discussion and Q&amp;A for the day's presenters and Service-Now.com resources. Also a word of congratulations goes out to the trivia winners of the door prizes. As becoming tradition, the networking and conversation continued at Matt the Millers.</span></span></span></p><br /> <p>Until next time,</p><br /> <p>Garrick</p><br /> <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></span></p></p>
