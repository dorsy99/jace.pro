Great to see we finally hit the 100 mark on the members of the Ohio LUG of Service-Now.com. I look forward to talking with everyone about the experience of the user group at Knowledge '10 next month.</p><br /><p align="right" class="style1">&nbsp;</p><br /><p class="style1">Secondly, I wanted to give a sneak peak into a Firefox add-on I'm working on. The name for now is Service-Now Control and it allows some quick lookups with a right-click of anything you can highlight into a new tab. It's not quite ready to release yet as I just asked a few people to test it this week.</p><br /><p class="style1">We've had a lot of users ask for links to other incidents, knowledge base searches, and other cross-referencing. While there is some formatting and some personalization going on with the activity log, it's not quite there yet. I may move this to a Greasemonkey script that automatically inserts the links in the page, but that's a bit more work and time down the road. (Greasemokey would also allow for easy Google Chrome integration.)</p><br /><p class="style1">If testing goes well, I'll expand the flexibility and extend the availability to others in the SNC.com community.</p><br /><p class="style1">&nbsp;</p><br /><div align="center"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_AJEJQ1NIAFA/S5qTWT-4ysI/AAAAAAAAALQ/4TNCxH6selE/Service-Now%20Control.png" alt="SNControl" /></div><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p class="style1">Cheers,</p><br /><p class="style1">&nbsp;</p><br /><p class="style1">Garrick</p><br /><br /></p>
