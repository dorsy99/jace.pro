<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="183ff739db54db048c8ef4621f9619a5.iix" style="width: auto; height: 113px;" />Yesterday I showed you how to <a title="lightlyLoony/blog/2010/8/18/2031" href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=decc6265dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619eb">figure out whether an object had a certain property</a>. But suppose you didn't know ahead of time which property you wanted? Then what you'd want to do is to enumerate <i>all</i> the properties in the object, to see what you've got.<br /><br />Surely that's beyond anything JavaScript can do, right? <i>Wrong!</i><br /><!--break--><br />If I run this code:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />var whazzis = {};<br />whazzis.who = 'you';<br />whazzis.why = 'who knows';<br />whazzis.when = 'back then';<br />whazzis.where = 'over there';<br />whazzis.what = 'dunno';<br /><br />for (var name in whazzis) {<br />   gs.log(name + ': ' + whazzis[name]);<br />}</pre><br />I'll get this result:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />what: dunno<br />why: who knows<br />who: you<br />where: over there<br />when: back then<br /></pre><br />The <i>for (xxx in yyy)</i> statement enumerates all the properties in any object. Inside the <i>for</i> loop, the variable <i>xxx</i> is populated with the current property name being enumerated. What you do with that name inside the loop is completely up to you. In the example above, I simply printed out the value of it.<br /><br />Some things to keep in mind when using this statement:<br /><ul><li><b><i>All</i> properties are enumerated</b>: In particular it doesn't matter what value the property has. <i>Undefined</i>, <i>null</i>, <i>function</i> values â€” it doesn't matter, they're going to get enumerated.</li><li><b><i>Some</i> properties are <i>not</i>enumerated</b>: I just lied to you. Any property can be flagged as not enumerable. In general, any built-in properties (especially <i>functions</i>, aka <i>methods</i>) are not enumerated. Unless you do something special, any properties your code adds <i>will</i> be enumerable.</li><li><b>There is no guaranteed order</b>: Properties can be enumerated in any order. The order may change from browser to browser, from version to version of Service-now's server, or even from one time of day to another. <i>Do not write code that depends on the enumeration order!</i></li></ul></p>
