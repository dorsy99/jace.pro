<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />Today we've released a new topic about managing data. It involves some very intro-level documentation for administrators, as well as more detailed and better organized information about data dictionary tables and the system dictionary.<br /><br />The landing page is here:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Managing_Data<br /><br />And here is the PDF Book:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Book:Managing_Data<br /><br />Also, be advised that there's a new feature coming out in data management with Spring 2010 Stable 2, so if you check back in on this on Friday, the new information will be included.<br /><br />Feedback is, as always, welcome.<br /><br />Guy Yedawb<br />Service-now.com Documentation</p>
