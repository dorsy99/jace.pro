<p>Welcome to the group. Group membership is for managed services providers, to exchange information and coordinate activities specific to the use of Service-now in support of managed services, with particular emphasis on multi-tenancy. <br />We are planning on quarterly virtual user group meetings. Please post your thoughts on topics of discussion for our initial user group meeting, so we can start planning.<br />Thanks to Tom Moore, Rob Huckaby, and Rhett Glauser for sponsoring and getting this started!</p>
