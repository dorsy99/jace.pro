<p>Just a quick note to say Happy Thanksgiving and Holidays to all our Ohio Local User Group members. May you have a wonderful and rewarding holiday season! We look forward to seeing everyone in January for out next meet up and hope to see you there. We'll have more details soon for that meeting, so look for that in early December.<img  class="jive-image" src="983833f5dbd0d3049c9ffb651f961983.iix" alt="gobble gobble" align="right" /> <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Garrick</p>
