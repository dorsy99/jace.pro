<p>A member of the Texas User Group has discovered a bug in work flow that I wanted to make you aware of. Apparently if you make more than 1 change to a work flow update set then it corrupts the workflow. Srv Now knows about this and there is some work around or fix but thought this might be useful information to the user community so that others can benefit. Thanks Stephanie for the information.</p>
