<p>Hello everyone,<br /><br />We promised that we'd turn out a lot more API reference for you all, and true to that our API writer has turned out this GlideUser (g_user) reference:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=GlideUser_(g_user)<br /><br />You'll also note that we're instituting a new policy of marking when our script examples were last verified, so you'll know if you're looking at code that will work on your instance.<br /><br />As always, feedback is welcome!<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Service-now.com Documentation</p>
