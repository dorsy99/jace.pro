Big thanks to Marc Talluto and Patrick Stonelake of <a title="w.fruitionpartners.com/" href="http://www.fruitionpartners.com/">Fruition Partners</a> for their generous support of the Ohio Local User Group and sharing with us some of the opportunities and partnerships that Fruition can offer. Here is their contact information for further info:<br /><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table width="200" border="1" align="center" cellspacing="3"><tr><td><p><strong>Marc Talluto</strong></p><br /> <p>(m) 773.294.2950 <em>|</em></p><br /> <p>(o) 888.440.2730 x703<br /><br /> <u><br /><br /></u> <u><a title="rc.Talluto@FruitionPartners.com" href="mailto:Marc.Talluto@FruitionPartners.com">Marc.Talluto@FruitionPartners.com</a></u></p></td><td><a href="http://www.fruitionpartners.com/"><img  class="jive-image" src="ffb81502dbd813043eb27a9e0f9619e3.iix" alt="Fruition" width="160" height="73" /></a></td><td><p><strong>Patrick Stonelake</strong></p><br /> <p>&nbsp;(m) 773.294.6958</p><br /> <p>(o) 888.440.2730 x702</p><br /> <p><a title="trick.Stonelake@FruitionPartners.com" href="mailto:Patrick.Stonelake@FruitionPartners.com">Patrick.Stonelake@FruitionPartners.com</a></p><br /> <br /><br /></td></tr></table><br /><p>A second big "Thank you" goes to everyone who braved the Ohio weather to make it in to <a title="w.ohiohealth.com/homedublin.cfm?id=404" href="http://www.ohiohealth.com/homedublin.cfm?id=404">OhioHealth's Beautiful Dublin Methodist Hospital</a>. Many of you ventured down from Cleveland, Chicago, Dayton, and central Ohio to take part and even though many couldn't make it, we appreciate those who could. This point did bring up a good suggestion from some of the attendees--video conferencing for the next OLUG. Several places including Dublin have the capabilities for full video conferencing of the meeting, so we'll be looking into it for future meetings. Please feel free to send me a message if you have suggestions or are interested in hosting.</p><br /><p align="left">Even with a slightly abbreviated meeting we were able to hit on most of the agenda. Service-now's <a title="itter.com/TerryjBrown" href="http://twitter.com/TerryjBrown">Terry Brown</a> and <a title="w.service-now.com/" href="http://www.service-now.com/">Barry Brooks</a> highlighted the Winter '10 release and were there to answer the groups technical and strategic questions. Terry also spoke on the the upcoming <a title="fo.service-now.com/content/knowledge10" href="http://info.service-now.com/content/knowledge10">Knowledge '10 Service-Now.com Global User Conference</a> and offered a special rate for OLUG members. Please contact <a title="rry.brown@service-now.com" href="mailto:terry.brown@service-now.com">Terry</a> for that code and information on the conference.</p><br /><p>After graciously providing lunch, Marc Talluto of <a title="w.fruitionpartners.com/" href="http://www.fruitionpartners.com/">Fruition</a> spent the hour while we were munching to answer our questions and talk about ITSM and how Service-Now can help knit into best practices. Following Marc's presentation, <a title="itter.com/ohknowman" href="http://twitter.com/ohknowman">Jason Haugh</a> of <em><a title="dicalcenter.osu.edu/Pages/index.aspx" href="http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/Pages/index.aspx">The</a></em> <a title="dicalcenter.osu.edu/Pages/index.aspx" href="http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/Pages/index.aspx">Ohio State University Medical Center</a> shared with us a great presentation on Knowledge Management, how OSU utilizes the Service-Now KB, and best practices surrounding Knowledge Management. I'm going to speak for everyone and say we all enjoyed Jason's presentation and his enthusiasm and experience with knowledge management. Great discussion!</p><br /><p>And for those who may have missed the announcement or were unable to attend, we will not be having an OLUG meeting next quarter due to <a title="fo.service-now.com/content/knowledge10" href="http://info.service-now.com/content/knowledge10">Knowledge '10</a>. We will pick back up with the meetings in the summer. Look forward to seeing everyone out in San Diego!</p><br /><p><a href="http://info.service-now.com/content/knowledge10"><img src="http://www.service-now.com/files/images/thumbs/knowledg29163475.png" alt="Knowledge 10" width="92" height="63" /></a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>- Garrick</p></p>
