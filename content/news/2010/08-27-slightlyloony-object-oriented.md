<p><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="c88d5042db5c9fc03eb27a9e0f961951.iix" style="width: auto; height: 215px;" />Yesterday I showed you how <a href="/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=228c2ae1dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96197e">to make a very simple JavaScript <i>class</i></a>, and promised you that next I'd show you how to build the code that calculates a dog's age right into it. Well, that day has arrived, as the famous lass (do you know who she is?) at right is anticipating.<br /><br />We're going to accomplished this OO miracle by adding an <i>age method</i> to the <i>Dog class</i>. What's a method, you ask? Well, I'm here to answer:<br /><!--break--><br /><img  alt="" class="jive-image" src="507eb731db18d3041dcaf3231f96199c.iix" style="width: auto; height: 103px;" />A <i>method</i> is just a function that you can access from an <i>object</i>. It has some special features, most importantly the <i>this</i> object reference, which you've met at least once before (in yesterday's post). Let's look at an example: the <i>Dog class</i>, modified to add an <i>age</i> method. There are several things about this code that are likely new to you.<br /><br />First note that block of code just after the <i>Dog</i> constructor function. It's setting the property <i>Dog.prototype.age</i> to a function. But what is that property, especially the <i>prototype</i> part? Prototype is a property that's automatically assigned to any constructor function (which, remember, is the <i>class</i> template in JavaScript). It has one very special feature: any properties that the <i>prototype</i> property has are automatically made available to every <i>instance</i> of the class, without actually copying it to each instance. So, in our example, when we define <i>age</i> as a function that's a property of <i>Dog.prototype</i> (and that <i>is</i> what this code does!), we're defining a function that's automatically available to every instance of <i>Dog</i>. <br /><br />Second, note that within the function definition we make use of the <i>this</i> object reference to get the <i>birth_date</i> property of whatever instance of <i>Dog</i> we happen to call <i>age</i> on. Is your head exploding? Perhaps this will be easier if you see an example of code that uses our new method:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />var dog = new Dog('Miki', new Date(2006,1,11));<br />gs.log('Hey ' + dog.call_name + '!  You\'re ' + dog.age() + ' years old today!');<br /></pre><br />This is considerably less test code than we had yesterday. Now I don't have to compute the age myself, because the <i>Dog</i> class knows how to do it for me. Just as yesterday, the first line of this code creates an <i>instance</i> of <i>Dog</i> (which is named <i>dog</i>). This <i>instance</i> has the particulars for Miki, the amazing field spaniel you met yesterday.<br /><br />Now look at the next line: where I needed to print out Miki's age, all I had to write was:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />dog.age();<br /></pre><br />JavaScript interpreted that code by seeing that <i>dog</i> is an instance of <i>Dog</i>, and then seeing that <i>Dog.prototype</i> has a property that matches the name of the function after the ".": <i>age</i>. Then it invoked the <i>Dog.property.age</i> function, which used the code:<br /><pre style="margin-left:20px;line-height:1;"><br />this.birth_date<br /></pre><br />to look up Miki's birth date. And from there it calculated (and returned) his age in years.<br /><br />Methods sound much more complicated than they really are. Or perhaps I should say that another way: the details of how methods work sounds complicated, but using them is actually quite simple. You define them just as I defined <i>age</i> in the example, and you use them just as I did in today's test code. Just like any other function, <i>methods</i> can have arguments â€” everything you've learned about functions in previous posts applies to methods as well.<br /><br />I think that's quite enough for one day, don't you?</p>
