I know the listv2 plugin can offer some functionality here too, but this one doesn't require admin assistance to get working and offers a slightly different set of tools.<br /></p><p class="style1">&nbsp;</p><br /><div align="center"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_AJEJQ1NIAFA/S5qTWT-4ysI/AAAAAAAAALQ/4TNCxH6selE/Service-Now%20Control.png" alt="SNControl" /></div><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br />Currently, it's viable and working without a hitch. You'll need to put in your instance name in the \chrome\content\search.js file. It's commented so it should be pretty obvious, but if you have a question let me know. Currently, they're set to the demo site, so just change "demo.service-now.com" to "yourinstance.service-now.com" (Look at line 22 if you're really lost) and you should be good to go. I was going to add an option menu to enter your instance to avoid editing the code, but that's where I've left off. If anyone would like to pick that up, it would be great!<br /> <br /><br /><br /><p align="right" class="style1">&nbsp;</p><br /><p class="style1"><br />I'll be getting into Knowledge '10 on Saturday and will be there for the duration, so please feel free to look me up that week too if you have any questions. Hopefully, you'll find it as useful as we have for day-to-day use. Some of our service desk team have started using and found it helpful.<br /></p><br /><br /><p class="style1">Cheers and look forward to Knowledge '10,</p><br /><p class="style1">&nbsp;</p><br /><p class="style1">Garrick</p><br /><br /></p>
