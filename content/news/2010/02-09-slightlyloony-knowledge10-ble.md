<p><img __jive_id="6749" alt="cute cat.jpg" class="jive-image" style="width: imagecache/Medium/SlightlyLoony/cute cat.jpg; height: auto;" />Our Knowledge10 conference is coming up in just a couple of months! I'll be there, and I hope to see you there as well. But whether you're attending or not, we'd like to hear your thoughts on the best use of our two hour Discovery lab.<br /><br />We've had several ideas ourselves â€” a troubleshooting primer, an implementation primer, advanced classifications, building custom probes and sensors, and so on. But these are products of <i>our</i> fevered and slightly loony imaginations. What we'd really like to know is this: what would <i>you</i> find most valuable? Please let us know your thoughts in the comments to this post!<br /><!--break--></p>
