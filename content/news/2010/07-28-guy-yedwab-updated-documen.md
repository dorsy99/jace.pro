<p>Hi everyone,<br /><br />We've just completed a project to rewrite the Update Sets Documentation. You can find it here:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=System_Update_Sets_(remote_update_set_support)_Plugin<br /><br />And, of course, it's available as a book here:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Book:Update_Sets<br /><br />The plugin page and the "Using Update Sets" pages are cleaned-up, checked-for-accuracy versions of their older counterparts. There's also a new page called "Getting Started with Update Sets" that tells you what to do before you start so that you'll start:<br /><br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_Update_Sets<br /><br />As always, feedback is always welcome. <br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Guy Yedwab<br />Service-now.com Documentation<br /><br />(Update: after some feedback, also put out a list of tables whose customizations are tracked in an update set:<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=List_of_Tracked_Customizations )<br /><br />(Update 2: Added documentation on the Comparison Utility:<br />http://wiki.service-now.com/index.php?title=Using_the_Comparison_Utility)</p>
