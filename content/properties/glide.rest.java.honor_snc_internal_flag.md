description: "Property to control if Java implemented REST API resources will, by default, require requestors to have the ‘snc_internal’ role to be able to access REST API resources. When set to false this requirement will not be enforced. Individual REST API Resources can opt out of this requirement by using the annotation ‘RequiresSncInternalRole=false’. This property is only relevant when the explicit roles plugin is activated."
