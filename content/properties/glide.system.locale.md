description: "Locale code to use for localization. Format is [language code].[country code] (e.g. en.GB for Britain fr.FR for France, de.DE for Germany, or ja.JP for Japan).<br/> <br/> NOTE: Do not change this value once a system has gone into production. If a user's locale must be changed, update the 'Country code' field on the user record.<br/> <br/> The value of this property determines the system's default currency into which all prices are automatically converted before other sums or conversions are performed.<br/> Changing this property after any price or currency fields have been given a value (for Service Catalog items, Assets, Project Tasks, etc.) may result in improper conversion or prices that sum incorrectly."
