description: "<span style='font-weight:bold;font-size: larger'>Use Business time left field to determine if an SLA is breached<br/></span> Set to Yes to ensure the value of the <b>Business time left</b> field on a Task SLA is used to determine if it has breached.<br/> Set to No to ensure the value of the <b>Business percentage field</b> is used to determine if it has breached.<br/><b>Note</b>: The percentage value is rounded to 2 decimal places, such as 99.51% rounded to 100%, which may lead to a Task SLA being incorrectly set to have a breached status."
