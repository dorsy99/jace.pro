description: "Enable this property to set the X-Frame-Options response header to SAMEORIGIN for all UI pages.  The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a &lt;frame> or &lt;iframe>. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/the_x-frame-options_response_header"
