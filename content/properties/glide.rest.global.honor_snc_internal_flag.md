description: "Property to control if REST APIs will enforce the requirement that requestors have the snc_internal role to access REST API resources. Both Scripted REST APIs and Java Implemented REST APIs provide a way to specify that they require the snc_internal role on a per resource level. This property will determine if those per resource settings are enforced. When set to false requestors will not be required to have the snc_internal role regardless of per resource settings. This property is only relevant when the explicit roles plugin is activated.     "
