description: "<b>Host name case:</b> If 'Lower case' is selected, always translate the host name into lower case; if 'Upper case' is selected, always translate the host name to upper case; if 'No change' is selected, leave the host name intact. This primarily affects host names discovered with NETBIOS, though some non-standard DNS systems may also return some or all of the name in upper case."
